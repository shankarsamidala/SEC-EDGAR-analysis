part ii - other information

item 1.       legal proceedings.

      the company and its  subsidiaries  are  potential or named  defendants  in
several  lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary  course of business.  while
the outcome of such claims,  lawsuits or other  proceedings  against the company
cannot be predicted with certainty,  management expects that any liability under
the  foregoing,  to the extent not provided for through  insurance or otherwise,
will not have a material  adverse effect on the financial  conditions or results
of operations of the company.

      on august 29, 1997, access solutions  international,  inc. ("asi") filed a
complaint for patent infringement in the u.s. district court,  district of rhode
island, against data/ware development,  inc. ("data/ware"),  of which anacomp is
the successor by merger, and the eastman kodak company ("kodak").  the complaint
seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages,  including attorney's fees, for
the alleged  infringement  by data/ware and kodak of asi's united states letters
patent no. 4,775,969 for "optical disk storage format,  method and apparatus for
emulating a magnetic  tape drive" and no.  5,034,914  for "optical  disk storage
method and  apparatus  with  buffered  interface."  the  company has assumed the
defense  of this  matter on behalf of both  data/ware  and kodak,  although  the
company  has  also  requested   indemnification   from  the  principal   selling
shareholder of data/ware.  discovery in this matter continues, with any trial to
occur probably not before the third calendar quarter of 1999. although there can
be no assurance as to the eventual outcome of this matter,  the company believes
that it has numerous meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

item 2.  changes in securities and use of proceeds.

(c) unregistered  securities - pursuant to the 1996 non-employee  director stock
option  plan  (amended  and  restated  as of  december  1,  1997),  non-employee
directors of the company may elect to receive their annual  retainer in the form
of options to acquire common stock of the company.  pursuant to such  elections,
during the  three-month  period  ending  march 31,  1999,  an aggregate of 1,875
options was granted to  directors  in lieu of  aggregate  cash  compensation  of
$9,375.  the issuance of such options was effected in reliance  upon the private
placement exemption set forth in section 4 (2) of the securities act of 1933, as
amended,  on the  basis of the  directors'  familiarity  with the  business  and
affairs of the company. no underwriting fees or discounts were applicable to the
transactions.  the options are first  exercisable  six months  after the date of
grant and remain exercisable through the tenth anniversary of the grant date, at
an exercise price of $18.625 per share.

item 4.  submission of matters to a vote of security holders.

      at the company's annual meeting of shareholders  held on february 8, 1999,
