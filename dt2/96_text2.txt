notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)

1.the   accompanying   unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for interim financial  information  and  with
  the  instructions  to form 10-q and article 10  of  regulation  s-x.
  accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and
  footnotes  required by generally accepted accounting principles  for
  complete financial statements.  in the opinion of management,  these
  financial  statements contain all adjustments, consisting of  normal
  recurring  accruals,  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
  position,  results  of  operations and cash flows  for  the  periods
  indicated.   results of operations for the periods presented  herein
  are  not  necessarily indicative of results of  operations  for  the
  entire  year.   the  balance sheet at december  31,  1998  has  been
  derived  from  the audited financial statements at that  date.   for
  further  information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
  and  footnotes thereto included in the amr corporation (amr  or  the
  company) annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december  31,
  1998.   certain amounts from 1998 have been reclassified to  conform
  with the 1999 presentation.

2.accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and  property  at  june
  30,  1999  and december 31, 1998, was $7.7 billion and $7.3 billion,
  respectively.   accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital  leases at june 30, 1999 and december 31,  1998,  was
  $1.3 billion.

  effective  january 1, 1999, in order to more accurately reflect  the
  expected  useful  life  of  its aircraft, the  company  changed  its
  estimate of the depreciable lives of certain aircraft types from  20
  to  25  years  and  increased the residual value  from  five  to  10
  percent.   as a result of this change, depreciation and amortization
  expense  was  reduced by approximately $40 million and net  earnings
  was  increased  by  approximately $25 million, or $0.16  per  common
  share  diluted, for the three months ended june 30, 1999.   for  the
  six  months  ended  june  30,  1999, depreciation  and  amortization
  expense  was  reduced by approximately $80 million and net  earnings
  was  increased  by  approximately $50 million, or $0.31  per  common
  share diluted.

3.the  miami  international airport authority is currently remediating
  various  environmental  conditions at  miami  international  airport
  (airport)  and  funding the remediation costs  through  landing  fee
  revenues.   future costs of the remediation effort may be  borne  by
  carriers  operating  at  the airport, including  american  airlines,
  inc.   (american),  through  increased  landing  fees  and/or  other
  charges.  the ultimate resolution of this matter is not expected  to
  have a significant impact on the financial position or liquidity  of
  amr.

4.as  of june 30, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire the
  following  aircraft:  91 boeing 737-800s, 24 boeing 777-200igws,  95
  embraer emb-135s, 25 bombardier crj-700s and 17 embraer emb-145s.  in
  july 1999, the company exercised its purchase rights to acquire three
  additional  boeing 777-200igws.  deliveries of these  aircraft  will
  extend  through 2006.  payments for these aircraft will  approximate
  $1.4 billion during the remainder of 1999, $2.2 billion in 2000, $1.9
  billion in 2001 and an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion in 2002
  through 2006.

  in  april  1999,  the company announced that it will accelerate  the
  retirement  of  nine mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and 16  boeing  727-200
  aircraft  earlier  than anticipated, thereby eliminating  american's
  entire  dc-10 fleet by the end of 2000 and advancing the  retirement
  of the boeing 727 fleet to the end of 2003.

5.in  early  february  1999, some members of  the  allied  pilots
  association (apa) engaged in certain activities (increased sick time
  and  declining to fly additional trips) that resulted  in  numerous
  cancellations across american's system.  these actions were taken in
  response to the acquisition of reno air, inc. (reno) in december 1998
  and adversely impacted the company's 1999 net earnings. in an attempt
  to resolve the dispute, the company and the apa have agreed to non-
  binding mediation.

6.in  connection  with  a secondary offering  by  equant  n.v.  in
  february  1999,  the  company sold approximately 923,000  depository
  certificates for proceeds of $66 million.  the company recorded a pre-
  tax gain of $66 million as a result of this transaction.

93.3   percent   of  american's  aircraft  fleet  is  stage   iii,   a

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues increased $31 million, or 0.7  percent,
in  the  second  quarter of 1999 versus the same  period  last  year.
american's  passenger  revenues decreased  by  1.0  percent,  or  $38
million,  compared to the second quarter of 1998.   american's  yield
(the  average  amount one passenger pays to fly one  mile)  of  12.97
cents  decreased by 4.4 percent compared to the same period in  1998.
domestic  yields  decreased 2.4 percent from the  second  quarter  of
1998.   international  yields decreased 8.7 percent  due  to  a  11.6
percent  decrease in the pacific, a 10.7 percent decrease  in  europe
and  a  5.4  percent  decrease in latin  america.   the  decrease  in
domestic yields was due primarily to increased capacity and fare sale
activity  during the second quarter of 1999, the residual  effect  of
the apa job action from the first quarter of 1999, and the impact  of
international  yield decreases on domestic yields.  the  decrease  in
international  yields  was due primarily to large  industry  capacity
additions and increased fare sale activity in europe.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  3.5
percent  to 28.9 billion miles for the quarter ended june  30,  1999.
american's  capacity  or available seat miles  (asms)  increased  3.7
percent  to  40.4  billion  miles in  the  second  quarter  of  1999.
american's  domestic  traffic  increased  2.7  percent  on   capacity
increases  of 4.7 percent and international traffic grew 5.4  percent
on  capacity increases of 1.6 percent.  the increase in international
traffic  was  driven by a 62.3 percent increase  in  traffic  to  the
pacific on capacity growth of 48.4 percent and a 7.3 percent increase
in  traffic  to  europe  on capacity growth  of  8.1  percent.   this
increase  was partially offset by a 3.8 decrease in traffic to  latin
america on a capacity decrease of 8.7 percent.

american's  operations were adversely impacted  by  several  external
factors  in  the second quarter of 1999.  first, american experienced
record  delays  and cancellations due to weather,  primarily  at  its
dallas-fort  worth and chicago hubs.  in addition, the implementation
of   the   federal  aviation  administration's  new  display   screen
replacement  (dsr)  system caused numerous delays  and  cancellations
across  american's  system  as three of the  first  five  centers  to
receive the new dsr system - fort worth, new york, and chicago -  are
high-traffic cities in american's network which are responsible for a
significant amount of american's traffic.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 17.6 percent, or  $51  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express, a regional  carrier
based in the northeast, in march 1999.

the  airline  group's other revenues increased $23  million,  or  9.2
percent, primarily as a result of an increase in aircraft maintenance
work  performed by american for other airlines and increased  service
contracts, primarily related to ramp and consulting services.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.9 percent, or $231
million.   american's  jet  operations cost  per  asm  increased  0.6
percent  to  9.31 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  7.2
percent, or $105 million, primarily due to an increase in the average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts.   aircraft  fuel expense increased  2.5  percent,  or  $10
million,   due   to  a  4.8  percent  increase  in  american's   fuel
consumption, partially offset by a 3.6 percent decrease in american's
average price per gallon, including taxes.  other rentals and landing
fees increased $26 million, or 12.1 percent, due to higher facilities
rent  and  landing  fees across american's system.  aircraft  rentals
increased $19 million, or 13.3 percent, due primarily to the addition
of  reno aircraft.  other operating expense increased $76 million, or
10.9  percent,  due primarily to an increase in outsourced  services,
booking  fees,  aircraft maintenance work performed by  american  for
other airlines, and travel and incidental costs.

other  expense increased 36.6 percent, or $15 million, primarily  due
to  a  decrease  in  interest income resulting from lower  investment
balances and a decline in interest rates.

revenues
revenues for sabre increased $62 million, or 10.7 percent.  electronic
travel  distribution revenues increased approximately $49 million,  or
14.5  percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase  in
booking  volumes  and  an overall increase in the  average  price  per
booking  due  to a price increase implemented in february  1999.   the
increase  in  booking  fee revenues was also partially  driven  by  an
increase   in  bookings  made  through  sabre's  online  travel   site
(travelocity.com).   revenues  from information  technology  solutions
increased approximately $13 million, or 5.5 percent, primarily due  to
services  performed  under various information technology  outsourcing
agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  increased  $75  million,  or  16.0  percent,  due
primarily  to  increases in salaries and benefits expense,  subscriber
incentive   expense,   depreciation  and  amortization,   advertising,
miscellaneous  selling,  and product development  expenses,  and  data
processing expense.  salaries and benefits expense increased due to an
increase  in  the  average number of employees  necessary  to  support
sabre's  business growth, and wage and salary increases  for  existing
employees.   subscriber  incentive  expense  increased  in  order   to
maintain  and  expand  sabre's travel agency subscriber  base  and  to
respond  to  competitor pressures.  the increase in  depreciation  and
amortization  expense  was due primarily to the  amortization  of  the
deferred  asset  associated  with the  stock  options  granted  to  us
airways,  inc. (us airways).  advertising, miscellaneous selling,  and
product  development expenses increased in order  to  support  sabre's
growth initiatives. data processing costs increased  due to the growth
in bookings and transactions processed. these increases were partially
offset  by  a  decrease in contract labor expenses due  to  a  planned
reduction in contract labor headcount.

results of operations (continued)

for the six months ended june 30, 1999 and 1998

summary  amr recorded net earnings for the six months ended june  30,
1999  of  $426  million,  or $2.65 per common  share  diluted.   this
compares with net earnings of $699 million, or $3.91 per common share
diluted, for the same period in 1998.  amr's operating income of $668
million  decreased 47.5 percent, or $604 million,  compared  to  $1.3
billion  for  the  same  period in 1998.   amr's  net  earnings  were
adversely  impacted by an illegal job action by some members  of  the
apa  during the first quarter of 1999, which negatively impacted  the
company's  net earnings by an estimated $140 million,  or  $0.87  per
common  share diluted.  this was partially offset by the gain on  the
sale  of  amr services, amr combs and teleservice resources, and  the
gain  from the sale of the equant n.v. depository certificates,  such
gains  aggregating approximately $101 million after taxes,  or  $0.63
per common share diluted.

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues decreased $207 million, or 2.4 percent,
during the first six months of 1999 versus the same period last year.
american's  passenger  revenues decreased by  4.0  percent,  or  $296
million,  largely  as  a result of the illegal  job  action  by  some
members  of  the  apa during the first quarter of  1999.   american's
yield  (the  average amount one passenger pays to fly  one  mile)  of
13.05  cents decreased by 5.6 percent compared to the same period  in
1998.   domestic  yields decreased 3.9 percent  from  the  first  six
months   of  1998.   international  yields  decreased  9.4   percent,
reflecting  a  12.6 percent decrease in the pacific,  a  9.1  percent
decrease in europe and an 8.3 percent decrease in latin america.  the
decrease  in  domestic yield was due primarily to increased  capacity
and  fare  sale activity in the first six months of 1999 compared  to
the  same  period  in 1998, the apa job action,  and  the  impact  of
international  yield decreases on domestic yields.  the  decrease  in
international   yields  was  due  primarily  to  weak   international
economies, large industry capacity additions and increased fare  sale
activity.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  1.7
percent to 54.2 billion miles for the six months ended june 30, 1999.
american's  capacity  or available seat miles  (asms)  increased  1.9
percent  to  78.1  billion miles in the first  six  months  of  1999.
american's domestic traffic increased 1.4 percent on capacity  growth
of 1.9 percent and international traffic grew 2.3 percent on capacity
increases of 1.9 percent.  the increase in international traffic  was
driven  by  a  50.0  percent increase in traffic to  the  pacific  on
capacity growth of 59.6 percent and a 2.8 percent increase in traffic
to  europe  on  capacity growth of 5.8 percent.  this  was  partially
offset  by  a 4.0 percent decrease in traffic to latin america  on  a
capacity decline of 7.1 percent.

american's  operations were adversely impacted  by  several  external
factors  in  the second quarter of 1999.  first, american experienced
record  delays  and cancellations due to weather,  primarily  at  its
dallas-fort  worth and chicago hubs.  in addition, the implementation
of   the   federal  aviation  administration's  new  display   screen
replacement  (dsr)  system caused numerous delays  and  cancellations
across  american's  system  as three of the  first  five  centers  to
receive the new dsr system - fort worth, new york, and chicago -  are
high-traffic cities in american's network which are responsible for a
significant amount of american's traffic.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 12.1 percent, or  $66  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express in march 1999.

the  airline  group's other revenues increased $46  million,  or  9.5
percent, primarily as a result of an increase in aircraft maintenance
work  performed by american for other airlines and increased  service
contracts, primarily related to ramp and consulting services.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.0 percent, or $383
million.   american's jet operations cost per asm  increased  by  1.7
percent  to 9.46 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  $183
million, or 6.5 percent, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts.   aircraft  fuel expense decreased  6.8  percent,  or  $56
million,  due to a 10.4 percent decrease in american's average  price
per  gallon,  including  taxes, partially offset  by  a  2.9  percent
increase  in american's fuel consumption.  other rentals and  landing
fees increased $50 million, or 11.9 percent, due to higher facilities
rent  and  landing  fees across american's system.  aircraft  rentals
increased $37 million, or 13.0 percent, due primarily to the addition
of reno aircraft.  other operating expense increased $161 million, or
11.5  percent,  due primarily to an increase in outsourced  services,
booking  fees,  aircraft maintenance work performed by  american  for
other airlines, and travel and incidental costs.

other  expense  decreased 39.8 percent, or $41  million,  due  to  an
increase in capitalized interest on aircraft purchase deposits and  a
$31  million gain on the sale of a portion of american's interest  in
equant  n.v.,  partially  offset by a  decrease  in  interest  income
resulting  from lower investment balances and a decline  in  interest
rates.

revenues
revenues   for   sabre  increased  $146  million,  or  12.9   percent.
electronic  travel  distribution revenues increased approximately  $85
million, or 12.4 percent, due to growth in booking fees driven  by  an
increase  in  booking volumes and an overall increase in  the  average
price  per  booking  due to a price increase implemented  in  february
1999.   the increase in booking fee revenues was also partially driven
by  an  increase  in  bookings made through the travelocity.com  site.
revenues from information technology solutions increased approximately
$61  million,  or  13.6 percent, primarily due to  services  performed
under  the  information technology services agreement with us  airways
and  services performed under other information technology outsourcing
agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  increased  $162 million,  or  17.9  percent,  due
primarily  to  increases  in salaries, benefits  and  employee-related
costs,  subscriber  incentive expense, depreciation and  amortization,
advertising  and  miscellaneous selling expenses, and data  processing
costs.  salaries, benefits and employee-related costs increased due to
an  increase in the average number of employees necessary  to  support
sabre's  business growth, and wage and salary increases  for  existing
employees.   subscriber  incentive  expense  increased  in  order   to
maintain  and  expand  sabre's travel agency subscriber  base  and  to
respond  to  competitor pressures.  the increase in  depreciation  and
amortization  expense  was due primarily to the  amortization  of  the
deferred  asset  associated  with the  stock  options  granted  to  us
airways,  the acquisition of information technology assets to  support
the  us airways' contract, and normal additions.  these increases were
partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to the sale
of  data  center mainframe equipment to an unrelated party in  october
1998.   advertising  and miscellaneous selling expenses  increased  in
order  to  support the company's growth initiatives.  data  processing
costs increased due to the growth in bookings and transactions processed.

  in an effort to balance costs  with revenue  growth, and as a result of
certain inefficiencies uncovered after sabre's march 1999 reorganization,
sabre is reviewing a number of alternatives aimed  at strategically
managing costs and improving operating margins  in  the latter  half
of  1999. such alternatives may  result  in  headcount reductions in
certain areas, reduced spending on discretionary  items, and
prioritization and streamlining of current development projects in
order  to  focus  resources on those that provide the  best  long-term
solution.    sabre   intends  to  implement  such   measures   without
compromising  the  service  levels  or  commitments  to  its  existing
customers or reducing sales and marketing efforts to continue to  grow
the outsourcing business.

other income
other  income  increased $38 million primarily due to a  $35  million
gain  on  the  sale  of equant n.v. depository certificates  held  by
american for the economic benefit of sabre.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash  provided by operating activities in the  six-month  period
ended june 30, 1999 was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $44 million  over
the  same  period in 1998.  this decrease resulted primarily  from  a
decrease in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in the  air
traffic liability due to higher advanced sales.  capital expenditures
for  the first six months of 1999 were $2.1 billion, and included the
acquisition of 12 boeing 737-800s, 10 boeing 777-200igws, six  boeing
757-200s, four boeing 767-300ers and 13 embraer 145 aircraft.   these
capital  expenditures were financed with internally  generated  cash,
except  for  12  boeing aircraft which were financed through  secured
mortgage agreements, one boeing aircraft which was financed through a
sale-leaseback  transaction,  and the embraer  aircraft   which  were
funded through secured debt agreements.

  as  of  june  30, 1999, the company had commitments to  acquire  the
following  aircraft:   91 boeing 737-800s, 24 boeing  777-200igws,  95
embraer  emb-135s, 25 bombardier crj-700s and 17 embraer emb-145s.  in
july  1999, the company exercised its purchase rights to acquire three
additional  boeing  777-200igws.  deliveries of  these  aircraft  will
extend  through  2006.  payments for these aircraft  will  approximate
$1.4  billion during the remainder of 1999, $2.2 billion in 2000, $1.9
billion in 2001 and an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion in 2002
through  2006.  the company expects to fund its remaining 1999 capital
expenditures   from  the  company's  existing  cash   and   short-term
investments,  internally generated cash, and new  financing  depending
upon capital market conditions and the company's evolving view of  its
long-term needs.

  in  april  1999,  the company announced that it will accelerate  the
retirement  of  nine  mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and  16  boeing  727-200
aircraft  earlier  than  anticipated, thereby  eliminating  american's
entire dc-10 fleet by the end of 2000 and advancing the retirement  of
the boeing 727 fleet to the end of 2003.

   on july 13, 1999, the company issued $150 million of unsecured debt
bearing interest at 7.875 percent, maturing on july 13, 2039,  and  is
callable at par after july 13, 2004.

    during  the six months ended june 30, 1999, the company purchased
approximately 10.7 million shares of its common stock at  a  cost  of
approximately $664 million.  additional share repurchases  of  up  to
$241  million, which is the remaining amount currently authorized  by
the  company's  board of directors, may be made from  time  to  time,
depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time.

    in  march 1999, sabre's board of directors authorized, subject  to
certain  business and market conditions, the repurchase of up  to  1.0
million shares of sabre's class a common stock.  during the six months
ended june 30, 1999, sabre purchased approximately 545,000 shares at a
cost of approximately $32 million.

   in  connection with a secondary offering by equant n.v. in february
1999,  the  company sold approximately 923,000 depository certificates
for  proceeds  of $66 million.  during the first six months  of  1999,
the  company  acquired  approximately 400,000 depository  certificates
from  other airlines.  in addition, based upon a reallocation  between
the  owners of the certificates in july 1999, the company received  an
additional  2.6  million certificates.  accordingly, as  of  july  30,
1999,   the   company  holds  approximately  5.3  million   depository
certificates  with  an  estimated market value of  approximately  $474
million.

year 2000 readiness

state  of readiness   in 1995, the company implemented a project  (the
year  2000  project)  to  ensure that hardware  and  software  systems
operated  by  the company, including software licensed to or  operated
for  third  parties  by  sabre, are designed to operate  and  properly
manage dates beyond december 31, 1999 (year 2000 readiness).  the year
2000  project consists of six phases: (i) awareness, (ii)  assessment,
(iii)  analysis, design and remediation, (iv) testing and  validation,
(v)  quality  assurance review (to ensure consistency  throughout  the
year  2000 project) and (vi) creation of business continuity strategy,
including plans in the event of year 2000 failures.  in developing the
company's  proprietary  software  analysis,  remediation  and  testing
methodology for year 2000 readiness, it studied the best practices  of
the  institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the british
standards  institution.  the company has assessed  (i)  the  company's
over  1,000 information technology and operating systems that will  be
utilized  after  december 31, 1999 (it systems); (ii)  non-information
technology  systems,  including embedded technology,  facilities,  and
other  systems (non-it systems); and (iii) the year 2000 readiness  of
its critical third party service providers.

      it systems   the company has completed the first three phases of
the  year  2000  project for all of its it systems.  the  company  has
successfully  completed the testing and validation phase  and  quality
assurance review phase for 99 percent of its it systems, including its
computer  reservations and flight operating systems that perform  such
"mission   critical"  functions  as  passenger  bookings,   ticketing,
passenger  check-in, aircraft weight and balance, flight planning  and
baggage  and  cargo processing.  as of july 1, 1999, approximately  43
percent  of  those  it  systems  (including  the  computer  reservations
systems)  are  already successfully processing year  2000  dates in
actual use.

      using dedicated testing environments and applying rigorous test
standards, the company is actively testing the remaining one  percent
of  its  it  systems to determine if they are year 2000 ready  or  if
further  remediation is necessary.  the company estimates  completing
the  testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase,
and the business continuity phase for its remaining it systems during
the third quarter of 1999.

     non-it  systems   the company has completed the first five phases
of the year 2000 project for 99 percent of its non-it systems, such as
aircraft  avionics  and  flight  simulators.   the  company  estimates
completing  the  final  phase of business continuity  for  its  non-it
systems during the third quarter of 1999.

    third  party services   the company's business is dependent  upon
entities   which  supply  critical  infrastructure  to  the   airline
industry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of  the
federal    aviation   administration   and   international   aviation
authorities,   the   department   of  transportation,   and   airport
authorities.  those  service providers depend on their  hardware  and
software  systems  and on interfaces with the company's  it  systems.
the  company  is  actively involved in the air transport  association
(ata)  and  the international air transport association  (iata)  year
2000  airline  industry program to ensure the readiness of  airports,
air  traffic  service  providers, and  commercial  airline  suppliers
worldwide. as  part of this program, the ata and  iata are monitoring
approximately  2,500  airports,  185  air  traffic  control   service
providers,   and   more  than  5,000  commercial  airline   suppliers
throughout  the  world  regarding their  year  2000  readiness.   the
results of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic and
international   airports  in  which  american  operates   have   made
significant    progress   towards   their   year   2000    readiness.
nevertheless, the company continues to closely monitor  the  progress
of  a  number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for  the
year 2000, could disrupt the company's ability to provide services to
its customers.

   in  addition,  the company relies on third party service  providers
for  many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power,  and
data  and credit card transaction processing.  those service providers
depend  on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces  with
the company's it systems. the company is monitoring its critical service
providers  regarding  their  year  2000  readiness  and  has  received
responses  from  approximately  87 percent  of  its  critical  service
providers.   such respondents assured the company that their  software
and  hardware is or will be year 2000 ready.  to the extent practical,
the  company will implement contingencies for the third party critical
service providers that have not responded.

    the  company  does  not  expect the year  2000  issues  it  might
encounter  with third parties to be materially different  from  those
encountered by other airlines, including the company's competitors.

                                -17-
<page> 20
costs  of year 2000 project   the company expects to incur significant
hardware,  software and labor costs, as well as consulting  and  other
expenses, in its year 2000 project. the company's total estimated cost
of  the  project  is  $215  to $220 million,  of  which  approximately
$204  million was incurred as of june 30, 1999.  costs associated with
the year 2000 project are expensed as incurred, other than capitalized
hardware costs, and have been funded through cash from operations.

risks  of  year 2000 non-readiness   the economy in general,  and  the
travel  and transportation industries in particular, may be  adversely
affected  by  risks  associated  with the  year  2000.  the  company's
business,  financial  condition, and results of  operations  could  be
materially  adversely affected if systems that it operates or  systems
that  are  operated by third party service providers  upon  which  the
company  relies  are not year 2000 ready in time.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that these systems will continue to properly  function  and
interface and will otherwise be year 2000 ready.  management  believes
that  its  most likely year 2000 risks relate to the failure of  third
parties with whom it has material relationships to be year 2000 ready.

    although the company is not aware of any threatened claims related
to  the  year  2000, the company may be subject to litigation  arising
from  such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation could
have  a  material  adverse affect on the company.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that the company's insurance coverage would be adequate  to
offset these and other business risks related to the year 2000 issue.

business continuity plans   the company has identified four potential
risk  areas  related to the year 2000 and is developing  and  refining
plans  to continue its business in the event of year 2000 failures  in
response  to  those risks. the company believes that its  most  likely
year  2000 risks relate to the failure of third parties with  whom  it
has material relationships to be year 2000 compliant.  in response  to
this  risk, the company has been actively participating with  the  ata
and iata year 2000 airline industry program to ensure the readiness of
airports  and air traffic services worldwide.  the company is  in  the
process  of collecting additional business continuity information from
such suppliers in order to effectively manage any failures. the second
risk  area  relates to the effective prioritization and management  of
any  year  2000  failures.  the company is establishing an  enterprise
command  center  in  order  to prioritize  issues,  manage  resources,
coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in the  event  of
year  2000  failures. the third risk area relates to the possibility
that the company's employees will fail to report to work on or around
december 31, 1999, thereby potentially disrupting the company's operations.
in order to mitigate such risk, american may voluntarily reduce its
schedule during this timeframe. the fourth risk area relates to the
failure of critical internal business processes, services, systems and
facilities. although the company has tested all systems including those
not impacted by dates, the company is developing business continuity
plans to manage potential internal year 2000 failures and expects to
complete these plans by september 30, 1999. the company's business continuity
plans  include  performing  certain  processes  manually;  maintaining
dedicated  staff to be available at crucial dates to remedy unforeseen
problems; installing defensive code to protect real-time systems  from
improperly formatted date data supplied by third parties; repairing or
obtaining replacement systems; and reducing or suspending certain non-
critical aspects of the company's services or operations.  because  of
the  pervasiveness  and  complexity of the year  2000  issue,  and  in
particular the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third
parties to be year 2000 compliant, the company will continue to refine
its contingency plans during 1999.

    the  costs of the project and the date on which the company plans
to complete the year 2000 readiness program are based on management's
best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions  of
future   events  including  the  continued  availability  of  certain
resources,   third  party  modification  plans  and  other   factors.
even though the company has met all established deadlines and the cost
estimates have remained constant, actual results could differ  materially
from these estimates. specific factors that might cause such  material
differences  include,  but are not limited to, the  availability  and
cost  of  personnel trained in this area, the ability to  locate  and
correct all relevant computer codes, the failure of third parties  to
be year 2000 ready, and similar uncertainties.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas  and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three  states (kansas, mississippi and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft  configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997  amendment).   in
october  1997,  the  city of fort worth filed suit in  state  district
court  against  the city of dallas and others seeking to  enforce  the
bond ordinance.  fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does  not
preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights  to
restrict  traffic at love field in a manner consistent with  the  bond
ordinance  and,  moreover, that dallas has an  obligation  to  do  so.
american  joined in this litigation.  on october 15, 1998,  the  state
district  court  granted summary judgment in favor of fort  worth  and
american,  which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort  worth
court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that
irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use
agreement  prohibits  american and other dfw signatory  airlines  from
moving  any interstate operations to love field.  these claims  remain
unresolved.   dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment  action  in
federal  district court seeking to have the court declare that,  as  a
matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes dallas from exercising any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental  airlines  and  continental express  filed  a  lawsuit  in
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using  regional jets.   in  december  1998,  the
department of transportation (dot) issued an order on the federal  law
questions  concerning  the bond ordinance, local  proprietary  powers,
dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright
and  1997  amendments,  and  concluded that  the  bond  ordinance  was
preempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable.  the  dot
also  found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american  from
conducting interstate operations at love field.  fort worth,  american
and  dfw  have appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court  of
appeals.

    as  a  result  of the foregoing, the future of interstate  flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
could adversely impact american's business.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in january 1985, american announced a new fare category, the "ultimate
supersaver,"  a  discount, advance purchase fare  that  carried  a  25
percent  penalty  upon cancellation.  on december 30,  1985,  a  class
action  lawsuit  was  filed in circuit court,  cook  county,  illinois
entitled  johnson  vs. american airlines, inc.  the johnson  plaintiff
alleges  that the 10 percent federal excise transportation tax  should
have  been excluded from the "fare" upon which the 25 percent  penalty
was  assessed.  summary judgment was granted in favor of american  but
subsequently reversed and vacated by the illinois appellate court.  in
august  1997,  the  court  denied the  plaintiffs'  motion  for  class
certification.  american is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

   in connection with its frequent flyer program, american was sued in
two  purported class action cases (wolens et al v. american  airlines,
inc. and tucker v. american airlines, inc.) that were consolidated and
are  currently pending in the circuit court of cook county,  illinois.
the   litigation  arises  from  certain  changes  made  to  american's
aadvantage frequent flyer program in may 1988 which limited the number
of seats available to participants traveling on certain awards. in the
consolidated action, the plaintiffs seek to represent all persons  who
joined  the  aadvantage program before may 1988  and  accrued  mileage
credits  before the seat limitations were introduced and  allege  that
these  changes  breached american's contract with aadvantage  members.
plaintiffs  seek  money damages and attorney's  fees.   the  complaint
originally  asserted  several  state  law  claims,  however  only  the
plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.  s.  supreme
court  ruled  that  the airline deregulation act preempted  the  other
claims.   although  the case has been pending for numerous  years,  it
still  is in its preliminary stages.  the court has not ruled  on  the
plaintiffs'  motion  for class certification. american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. is also pending in the
circuit  court  of cook county, illinois.  in december 1993,  american
announced that the number of miles required to claim a certain  travel
award  under  american's aadvantage frequent flyer  program  would  be
increased  effective february 1, 1995, giving rise  to  the  gutterman
litigation  filed  on that same date.  the gutterman plaintiffs  claim
that  the  increase  in  award mileage level violated  the  terms  and
conditions  of the agreement between american and aadvantage  members.
on  june  23,  1998, the court certified the case as a  class  action,
although  to  date  no notice has been sent to the class.   the  class
consists  of all members who earned miles between january 1, 1992  and
february 1, 1995 (the date the change became effective).  on july  13,
1998,  the court denied american's motion for summary judgment  as  to
the  claims brought by plaintiff steven gutterman.  on july 30,  1998,
the  plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as  to  liability,
which  motion  has  not  been  ruled  upon.   american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    a  federal grand jury in miami is investigating whether  american
and  american eagle handled hazardous materials and processed courier
shipments,  cargo  and excess baggage in accordance  with  applicable
laws and regulations.  in connection with this investigation, federal
agents  executed a search warrant at american's miami  facilities  on
october  22,  1997.   since  that time, a number  of  employees  have
testified  before  the grand jury.  in addition,  american  has  been
served  with three subpoenas calling for the production of  documents
relating to the handling of courier shipments, cargo, excess  baggage
and  hazardous  materials  handling and  spills.   american  produced
documents  responsive to the three subpoenas.   american  intends  to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998,  continental,  delta  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
american  intends to vigorously defend the granting  of  the  summary
judgment on appeal.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo shippers adversely affected by an illegal sick-out by  some
of  american's pilots in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american  independently  liable.
instead, plaintiffs named american as a defendant inasmuch as american
has  a  $45 million judgment against the apa that exceeds apa's  total
assets.  plaintiffs claim they are entitled to some or all  of  the
apa's limited funds.  apa filed cross claims against american alleging
that  american must indemnify pilots who put themselves  on  the  sick
list.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

    on  july  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed  against  amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding  corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc.  in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district   of
california,  western  division (westways world  travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp., et al).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies  to
pay  debit  memos to american for violations of american's fare  rules
(by  customers of the agencies) violates the racketeer influenced  and
corrupt  organizations  act of 1970 (rico).  the  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations from july
26,  1995  to  the present.  plaintiffs seek to enjoin  american  from
enforcing  the  pricing rules in question and to recover  the  amounts
paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

    on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to  remedy  the alleged effects  of  its  past  conduct.
american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

    between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to  the  present, although to date no class has been  certified.
american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

    also since the filing of the department of justice case, one class
action  lawsuit  filed  on  april 13, 1999, against  amr  corporation,
american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding corporation in  federal
court  in  fort lauderdale, florida, (zifrony v. amr corp.,  et  al.),
alleging  that american violated federal antitrust law by monopolizing
and attempting to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
and miami international airport, was dismissed.

item 4.  submission of matters to a vote of security holders

the  owners  of 140,165,083 shares of common stock, or 89  percent  of
shares  outstanding,  were  represented  at  the  annual  meeting   of
stockholders  on  may  19, 1999 at the american  airlines  training  &amp;
conference center, 4501 highway 360 south, fort worth, texas.

elected  as directors of the corporation, each receiving a minimum  of
139,531,183 votes were:

david l. boren                     ann d. mclaughlin
edward a. brennan                  charles h. pistor, jr.

armando m. codina                  judith rodin
earl g. graves                     maurice segall
dee j. kelly

stockholders  ratified  the  appointment  of  ernst  &amp;  young  llp  as
independent  auditors  for the corporation for  1999.   the  vote  was
139,819,436 in favor; 67,519 against; and 278,128 abstaining.

item 5.  other information

the  department of justice is investigating the competitive  practices
of   major  carriers  at  major  hub  airports,  including  american's
practices  at  dfw  (for  further  information,  see  item  1.   legal
proceedings).   also, in april 1998, the dot issued  proposed  pricing
and  capacity rules that would severely limit major carriers'  ability
to   compete  with  new  entrant  carriers.   the  outcomes   of   the
investigations  and the proposed dot rules are unknown.   however,  to
the  extent that (i) restrictions are imposed upon american's  ability
to  respond  to  a competitor, or (ii) competitors have  an  advantage
because  of  federal assistance, american's business may be  adversely
impacted.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas  and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three  states (kansas, mississippi and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft  configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997  amendment).   in
october  1997,  the  city of fort worth filed suit in  state  district
court  against  the city of dallas and others seeking to  enforce  the
bond ordinance.  fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does  not
preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights  to
restrict  traffic at love field in a manner consistent with  the  bond
ordinance  and,  moreover, that dallas has an  obligation  to  do  so.
american  joined in this litigation.  on october 15, 1998,  the  state
district  court  granted summary judgment in favor of fort  worth  and
american,  which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort  worth
court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that
irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use
agreement  prohibits  american and other dfw signatory  airlines  from
moving  any interstate operations to love field.  these claims  remain
unresolved.   dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment  action  in
federal  district court seeking to have the court declare that,  as  a
matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes dallas from exercising any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental  airlines  and  continental express  filed  a  lawsuit  in
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using  regional jets.   in  december  1998,  the
department of transportation (dot) issued an order on the federal  law
questions  concerning  the bond ordinance, local  proprietary  powers,
dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright
and  1997  amendments,  and  concluded that  the  bond  ordinance  was
preempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable.  the  dot
also  found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american  from
conducting interstate operations at love field.  fort worth,  american
and  dfw  have appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court  of
appeals.

    as  a  result  of the foregoing, the future of interstate  flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
could adversely impact american's business.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in january 1985, american announced a new fare category, the "ultimate
supersaver,"  a  discount, advance purchase fare  that  carried  a  25
percent  penalty  upon cancellation.  on december 30,  1985,  a  class
action  lawsuit  was  filed in circuit court,  cook  county,  illinois
entitled  johnson  vs. american airlines, inc.  the johnson  plaintiff
alleges  that the 10 percent federal excise transportation tax  should
have  been excluded from the "fare" upon which the 25 percent  penalty
was  assessed.  summary judgment was granted in favor of american  but
subsequently reversed and vacated by the illinois appellate court.  in
august  1997,  the  court  denied the  plaintiffs'  motion  for  class
certification.  american is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

   in connection with its frequent flyer program, american was sued in
two  purported class action cases (wolens et al v. american  airlines,
inc. and tucker v. american airlines, inc.) that were consolidated and
are  currently pending in the circuit court of cook county,  illinois.
the   litigation  arises  from  certain  changes  made  to  american's
aadvantage frequent flyer program in may 1988 which limited the number
of seats available to participants traveling on certain awards. in the
consolidated action, the plaintiffs seek to represent all persons  who
joined  the  aadvantage program before may 1988  and  accrued  mileage
credits  before the seat limitations were introduced and  allege  that
these  changes  breached american's contract with aadvantage  members.
plaintiffs  seek  money damages and attorney's  fees.   the  complaint
originally  asserted  several  state  law  claims,  however  only  the
plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.  s.  supreme
court  ruled  that  the airline deregulation act preempted  the  other
claims.   although  the case has been pending for numerous  years,  it
still  is in its preliminary stages.  the court has not ruled  on  the
plaintiffs'  motion  for class certification. american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. is also pending in the
circuit  court  of cook county, illinois.  in december 1993,  american
announced that the number of miles required to claim a certain  travel
award  under  american's aadvantage frequent flyer  program  would  be
increased  effective february 1, 1995, giving rise  to  the  gutterman
litigation  filed  on that same date.  the gutterman plaintiffs  claim
that  the  increase  in  award mileage level violated  the  terms  and
conditions  of the agreement between american and aadvantage  members.
on  june  23,  1998, the court certified the case as a  class  action,
although  to  date  no notice has been sent to the class.   the  class
consists  of all members who earned miles between january 1, 1992  and
february 1, 1995 (the date the change became effective).  on july  13,
1998,  the court denied american's motion for summary judgment  as  to
the  claims brought by plaintiff steven gutterman.  on july 30,  1998,
the  plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as  to  liability,
which  motion  has  not  been  ruled  upon.   american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    a  federal grand jury in miami is investigating whether  american
and  american eagle handled hazardous materials and processed courier
shipments,  cargo  and excess baggage in accordance  with  applicable
laws and regulations.  in connection with this investigation, federal
agents  executed a search warrant at american's miami  facilities  on
october  22,  1997.   since  that time, a number  of  employees  have
testified  before  the grand jury.  in addition,  american  has  been
served  with three subpoenas calling for the production of  documents
relating to the handling of courier shipments, cargo, excess  baggage
and  hazardous  materials  handling and  spills.   american  produced
documents  responsive to the three subpoenas.   american  intends  to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998,  continental,  delta  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
american  intends to vigorously defend the granting  of  the  summary
judgment on appeal.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo shippers adversely affected by an illegal sick-out by  some
of  american's pilots in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american  independently  liable.
instead, plaintiffs named american as a defendant inasmuch as american
has  a  $45 million judgment against the apa that exceeds apa's  total
assets.  plaintiffs claim they are entitled to some or all  of  the
apa's limited funds.  apa filed cross claims against american alleging
that  american must indemnify pilots who put themselves  on  the  sick
list.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

    on  july  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed  against  amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding  corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc.  in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district   of
california,  western  division (westways world  travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp., et al).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies  to
pay  debit  memos to american for violations of american's fare  rules
(by  customers of the agencies) violates the racketeer influenced  and
corrupt  organizations  act of 1970 (rico).  the  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations from july
26,  1995  to  the present.  plaintiffs seek to enjoin  american  from
enforcing  the  pricing rules in question and to recover  the  amounts
paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

    on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to  remedy  the alleged effects  of  its  past  conduct.
american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

    between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to  the  present, although to date no class has been  certified.
american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

    also since the filing of the department of justice case, one class
action  lawsuit  filed  on  april 13, 1999, against  amr  corporation,
american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding corporation in  federal
court  in  fort lauderdale, florida, (zifrony v. amr corp.,  et  al.),
alleging  that american violated federal antitrust law by monopolizing
and attempting to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
and miami international airport, was dismissed.

item 4.  submission of matters to a vote of security holders

the  owners  of 140,165,083 shares of common stock, or 89  percent  of
shares  outstanding,  were  represented  at  the  annual  meeting   of
stockholders  on  may  19, 1999 at the american  airlines  training  &amp;
conference center, 4501 highway 360 south, fort worth, texas.

elected  as directors of the corporation, each receiving a minimum  of
139,531,183 votes were:

david l. boren                     ann d. mclaughlin
edward a. brennan                  charles h. pistor, jr.

armando m. codina                  judith rodin
earl g. graves                     maurice segall
dee j. kelly

stockholders  ratified  the  appointment  of  ernst  &amp;  young  llp  as
independent  auditors  for the corporation for  1999.   the  vote  was
139,819,436 in favor; 67,519 against; and 278,128 abstaining.

item 5.  other information

the  department of justice is investigating the competitive  practices
of   major  carriers  at  major  hub  airports,  including  american's
practices  at  dfw  (for  further  information,  see  item  1.   legal
proceedings).   also, in april 1998, the dot issued  proposed  pricing
and  capacity rules that would severely limit major carriers'  ability
to   compete  with  new  entrant  carriers.   the  outcomes   of   the
investigations  and the proposed dot rules are unknown.   however,  to
the  extent that (i) restrictions are imposed upon american's  ability
to  respond  to  a competitor, or (ii) competitors have  an  advantage
because  of  federal assistance, american's business may be  adversely
impacted.
