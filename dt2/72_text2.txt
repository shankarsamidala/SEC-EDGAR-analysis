the united states district court for the northern district of texas. the
company, certain of its officers and directors and certain of the underwriters
and other entities involved in the company's initial public offering were named
as defendants in the first two complaints. these complaints were filed by
stockholders who claim to represent a purported class of stockholders who
acquired shares of the company's common stock between july 2, 1996 and december
17, 1997. the complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief under the
federal securities laws based on allegations that the company made omissions and
misleading disclosures in public reports and press releases and to securities
analysts during 1996 and 1997 concerning the company's financial condition, its
future business prospects and the impact of various acquisitions. these two
lawsuits were consolidated on july 2, 1998. the company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to plaintiff's claims and intends to vigorously defend the
action.

stockholders who acquired shares of the company's common stock between february

as defendants, was dismissed on june 29, 1998.
