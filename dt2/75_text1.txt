                       management's discussion and analysis of
                    results of operations and financial condition

overview
the merger  with  tele-communications,  inc.  (tci) was  completed  in the first
quarter of 1999 in an all stock transaction valued at approximately $52 billion.
at&amp;t;  issued  approximately  664  million  shares in the  transaction,  of which
approximately  149 million were treasury  shares.  also in  connection  with the
merger of tci in the first  quarter of 1999,  and the formation of liberty media
group  from  tci's  former  programming  business  and  technology   investments
business, at&amp;t; issued a separate tracking stock designed to reflect the separate
economic  performance  of liberty  media  group.  a total of 540 million  shares
(1,080  million  shares on a  post-split  basis) of class a liberty  media group
tracking stock and 55 million shares (110 million shares on a post-split  basis)
of class b liberty  media group  tracking  stock were issued by at&amp;t.;  at&amp;t; also
issued 30 million class a liberty media group tracking shares (60 million shares
on a post-split basis) in connection with the conversion of certain  convertible
notes.  at&amp;t; does not have a  controlling  financial  interest in liberty  media
group,  therefore it has been  reflected as an equity  method  investment in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.  the results  attributable to
liberty media group are  reflected as separate  line items  "equity  losses from
liberty  media  group"  and  "investment  in  liberty  media  group and  related
receivables"  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.  as  a
separate  tracking stock, all of the earnings or losses related to liberty media
group are  excluded  from the  earnings  available to the holders of at&amp;t; common
stock.

the merger  with tci was  recorded  as a purchase.  accordingly,  the  operating
results of tci have been  included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  since the date of  acquisition.  for accounting  purposes the deemed
effective  date of the  acquisition  is march 1,  1999,  since the impact of thr
results from march 1, 1999,  through march 9, 1999, is deemed  immaterial to our
consolidated  results.  tci's cable and certain other operations,  including its
ownership interest in at home corporation  (excite@home),  but excluding liberty
media  group,  became  at&amp;t;  broadband  &amp; internet  services  (ab&amp;is;),  and were
combined  with the  existing  operations  of at&amp;t; to form the at&amp;t; common  stock
group (at&amp;t; group).

we segment  our  results  based on how we manage  our  business.  the  following
businesses comprise at&amp;t; group: business services, consumer services,  broadband
&amp;  internet  services  and  wireless  services.  a  fifth  category,  other  and
corporate, includes the results of at&amp;t; solutions,  international operations and
ventures,  other corporate  operations,  overhead and eliminations.  results are
discussed  for these five  categories  as well as for combined  at&amp;t; group.  the
discussion for the other and corporate category is further broken out to include
information  for at&amp;t;  solutions  (which  includes the results of the  solutions
outsourcing  unit, the internal at&amp;t; information  technology  services unit, and
the results of the ibm global  network which was acquired in the second  quarter
of 1999 and renamed  the at&amp;t; global  network  services  business or agns),  and
international operations and ventures.

operating  results are  discussed  separately  for at&amp;t; group and liberty  media
group.  all lines of the accompanying  consolidated  statements of income except
for  "equity  losses  from  liberty  media  group",   "income  from   continuing
operations"  and "net income"  reflect the results of at&amp;t; group only. all lines
of the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet,  except for the "investment in
liberty media group and related  receivables" and the components of shareowners'
equity labeled as relating to liberty media group are attributable to at&amp;t; group
only.  the  liquidity,  financial  condition,  risk  management  and  year  2000
discussion pertain to consolidated at&amp;t;, including liberty media group.

earnings  per share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to at&amp;t;  common
shareowners  were $0.49 on a diluted  basis for the second  quarter of 1999,  up
from a loss of $0.06 in the  second  quarter  of 1998.  earnings  per share from
continuing  operations  attributable to at&amp;t; common  shareowners were $0.88 on a
diluted basis in the first half of 1999,  compared with $0.41 on a diluted basis
in the first half of 1998.  the increases  were due to lower  restructuring  and
other charges,  net and increased income from operations  attributable to higher
revenues and an improved cost structure.

at&amp;t; group's  operational  earnings  were $0.49 per diluted share for the second
quarter  of 1999,  a decrease  of 9.3%,  or $0.05,  over the prior year  period.
operational eps for the second quarter excludes:
 ..net restructuring and other charges of $0.62 in 1998
 ..gains on sales of business of $.02 in 1999 and 1998
 ..a  $0.02  benefit  in 1999  from  changes  in tax rules  with  respect  to the
utilization  of acquired net operating  losses ..a loss of $0.04  reflecting the
earnings impact of our investment in excite@home and cablevison systems corp.
(cablevision)

the decrease in operational  earnings for the second quarter is due primarily to
the impact of our merger with tci.

excluding  the  impacts  of both tci and agns,  operational  eps for the  second
quarter of 1999 was $0.75,  an increase of 38.9%,  or $0.21,  compared  with the
second  quarter of 1998.  the increase was primarily due to higher  revenues and
improving margins.

at&amp;t; group's  operational  earnings  were $1.09 per diluted  share for the first
half of 1999,  an  increase  of 9.0%,  or  $0.09,  over the prior  year  period.
operational eps for the first half excludes:
 ..net restructuring and other charges of $0.22 in 1999 and $0.76 in 1998 ..gains
on sales of businesses of $0.05 in 1999 and $0.17 in 1998

utilization  of acquired net operating  losses ..a loss of $0.06  reflecting the
earnings impact of our investment in excite@home and cablevison.

the  increase in  operational  earnings  for the first half is due  primarily to
higher  revenues and improving  margins,  partially  offset by the impact of our
merger with tci.

excluding the impacts of both tci and agns,  operational  eps for the six months
ended june 30, 1999, was $1.42,  an increase of 42.0%,  or $0.42,  compared with
the prior year period primarily due to higher revenues and improving margins.

liberty  media  group's loss per share was $0.43 for the quarter  ended june 30,
1999,  and $0.48 for the period from the date of  acquisition  through  june 30,
1999.

growing  wireless  subscriber  base largely  attributable to the success of at&amp;t;
digital  one rate  service  which has  resulted  in higher  off-network  roaming
charges and higher costs and volume of  handsets.  a portion of the increase was

compensation  expense due to a favorable fcc ruling in the first quarter of 1999
and a lower provision for uncollectibles for business and consumer services.

8.2% for the  second  quarter  of 1999 and  declined  6.6% for the first half of
1999, versus the respective year-ago periods. these decreases were primarily due
to  savings  from  headcount  reductions  and other  cost  control  initiatives.
including  ab&amp;is; and agns,  sg&amp;a; expenses as a percentage of revenues were 22.1%
and 22.2% for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 1999, respectively,

restructuring  and other  charges,  net were a pretax benefit of $29 million for
the second quarter of 1999.  the benefit  included a $68 million pretax net gain
primarily related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would have competed
directly with the global venture at&amp;t; is forming with british telecommunications
plc (bt).  also included was an $11 million  pretax gain from the  settlement of
pension  obligations from at&amp;t;'s voluntary  retirement  incentive program offer.
partially offsetting these gains was a $50 million pretax charge recorded in the
second  quarter of 1999  related to the  estimated  losses that are  expected to
result from a  contribution  agreement tci entered into with  phoenixstar,  inc.
(phoenixstar),  formerly primestar,  inc., a previous equity investment.  to the
extent  necessary,  the company is required to satisfy  certain  liabilities  of
phoenixstar.  the remaining  obligation under this contribution  agreement which
expires in 2001 is $26 million.

second  quarter 1998  restructuring  and other  charges,  net of $2,743  million
pretax,  or a reduction  of  approximately  $0.62 per diluted  share,  primarily
related to charges associated with at&amp;t;'s voluntary retirement incentive program
offer.

restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the six months  ended june 30, 1999,
were $702  million  pretax,  or a reduction of  approximately  $0.22 per diluted
share.  included in this  balance was an  in-process  research  and  development
charge of $594 million  pretax  related to the tci  acquisition,  a $128 million
pretax net charge  primarily  related to the exit of certain joint ventures that
would have competed directly with the global venture at&amp;t; is forming with bt and
the $50 million pretax charge related to the phoenixstar  agreement noted above.
these charges were partially  offset by a $70 million pretax gain related to the
settlement  of pension  obligations  for former  employees  who accepted  at&amp;t;'s
voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

the in-process  research and  development  projects  related to tci's efforts to
offer voice over internet  protocol,  cost savings  efforts for cable  telephony
implementation and product integration efforts for advanced set-top devices that
would enable tci to offer next-generation  digital services.  although there are
significant  technological issues to overcome in order to successfully  complete
the acquired  in-process  research  and  development,  at&amp;t;  expects  successful
completion.  at&amp;t;  currently  anticipates  that (i) it will deploy  equipment to

restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the six months  ended june 30, 1998,

local-service  strategy as well as the second  quarter $2,743 million net pretax
charge primarily related to at&amp;t;'s voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

quarter  was 35.6%,  down from 42.9% in the second  quarter of 1998.  during the
second quarter of 1999 a change in the net operating loss  utilization tax rules
resulted in a $75 million reduction in the current quarter income tax provision.

restructuring charges, the effective tax rates in the second quarter of 1999 and
1998 were  38.6%  and  37.7%,  respectively.  the  increase  in the rate was due
primarily to higher non-tax deductible goodwill  amortization in 1999 as well as
the tax impacts of certain  1998 asset  dispositions  and foreign  legal  entity
restructurings.

at&amp;t; group segment results

business services
the business  services  segment results reflect sales of long distance and local
voice  and  data  services  to  business   customers,   including  domestic  and
international,   inbound  and  outbound,   intra-lata  toll,  calling  card  and
operator-handled  services and other network enabled services. this segment also
includes electronic commerce and  internet-protocol  (ip) for business customers
such as web site hosting and at&amp;t; worldnet business internet access.

consumer services
the   consumer    services   segment   includes   the   results   of   providing
telecommunications  services to  residential  customers  including  domestic and
international long distance services, intra-lata toll services, calling-card and
operator-handled  calling services, and prepaid calling cards. in addition, this
segment  includes at&amp;t; worldnet  residential  internet access service,  noncable
local services  provided to residential  customers and the costs associated with
the development of fixed wireless technology.

wireless services
the  results  of this  segment  are  comprised  primarily  of sales of  wireless
services and products to customers in at&amp;t; group's 850 mhz  (cellular)  and 1900
mhz (pcs) markets.  the results of at&amp;t;'s former messaging business are included
in 1998 results through october 2, when the unit was sold.

broadband &amp; internet services
this segment reflects operations  associated with providing services through the
broadband  network acquired as a result of at&amp;t;'s merger with tci. this includes
the results  associated with  traditional  analog video service,  as well as new
services,  such as digital  cable and  at&amp;t;@home,  a high-speed  cable  internet
access service. at&amp;t;@home, along with several other large cable operators, has a
contract with excite@home, the operator of an internet "backbone", over which we
can provide high-speed cable internet service. also included in this segment are
the operations  associated with developing and refining the infrastructure  that
will support broadband telephony.

other and corporate
this  group   includes  the  results  of  at&amp;t;   solutions   (including   agns),
international operations and ventures, other corporate operations,  overhead and
eliminations.

the above segments  reflect  certain changes since the publication of our annual
results due to changes in the way we manage our business.  the business services
segment was  expanded to include  the results of teleport  communications  group
inc.  (tcg) and the  business  portion of at&amp;t;  worldnet  service;  the consumer
services  segment  was  expanded  to  include  the  residential  portion of at&amp;t;
worldnet service and the costs associated with the development of fixed wireless
technology. all prior results have been restated to reflect these changes.

the discussion of segment  results for at&amp;t; group generally  includes  revenues;
earnings  before  interest and taxes,  including  other income (ebit);  earnings
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization,  including other income
(ebitda);  capital additions and total assets. the discussion of ebitda for at&amp;t;
group's wireless services and broadband &amp; internet services segments is modified
to exclude other income.

at&amp;t; calculates ebit as operating income plus other income and is a measure used
by our chief operating  decision-makers to measure at&amp;t;'s consolidated operating
results and to measure segment  profitability.  interest and taxes are generally
not allocated to our segments because debt is managed and serviced and taxes are
managed and calculated on a centralized basis.  trends in interest and taxes are
discussed  separately on a  consolidated  basis.  management  believes ebit is a
meaningful  measure to disclose to investors because it provides  investors with
an analysis  of  operating  results  using the same  measures  used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of at&amp;t;,  provides a return on total  capitalization
measure,  and allows investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each
segment in relation to consolidated at&amp;t.; our calculation of ebit may or may not
be consistent with the calculation of ebit by other public  companies,  and ebit
should  not be viewed by  investors  as an  alternative  to  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (gaap) measures of income as a measure of performance or
to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity.

ebitda is also used by  management  as a measure of segment  performance  and is
defined as ebit plus depreciation and amortization.  we believe it is meaningful
to investors as a measure of each  segment's  liquidity and allows  investors to
evaluate a segment's  liquidity using the same measure that is used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of at&amp;t.;  consolidated  ebitda is also  provided for
comparison purposes. our calculation of ebitda may or may not be consistent with
the calculation of ebitda by other public  companies and should not be viewed by
investors  as an  alternative  to  gaap  measures  of  income  as a  measure  of
performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities
as a measure of liquidity. in addition, ebitda does not take into effect changes
in certain assets and liabilities which can affect cash flow.

total  assets  for  each  segment  include  all  assets,   except   inter-entity
receivables.  deferred taxes,  prepaid pension assets,  and  corporate-owned  or
leased real estate are generally  held at the corporate  level and therefore are
included in the other and corporate  group.  shared network assets are allocated
to the  segments and  reallocated  each  january,  based on the prior two years'
volumes of minutes used.

capital  additions  for each segment  include  additions to property,  plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets including licenses, investments, franchise
costs and capitalized software.

revenues
business  services  revenues  increased  6.7% in the second quarter of 1999, and
increased  7.1% for the first six months of 1999  compared  with the prior year.
the increase for the quarter was primarily driven by continued  strength in data
services and local voice services.  the increase for the year-to-date period was
primarily  driven by data  services,  domestic long distance  voice services and
local voice services.  total calling  volumes for both periods,  including local
services,  increased  about 25% over the prior year;  excluding  local services,
volumes maintained a mid-teens growth rate for both periods.

data  services  revenues  increased  by  more  than  20%  for  the  quarter  and
year-to-date  periods  led by  continued  growth in frame  relay and  high-speed
private line services partly due to continued customer demand for high-bandwidth
(oc-x)  capabilities.  the data  services  growth was  augmented by  significant
growth in ip services such as worldnet and virtual private  network  services to
business customers.  data growth was approximately 20% for the second quarter of
1999 compared with the prior year second  quarter when adjusted for at&amp;t;'s frame
relay service interruption in april 1998.

long  distance  voice  revenues grew at a  low-single-digit  rate for the second
quarter  and for the first six  months of 1999.  strong  volume  increases  were
partially  offset by a declining  average  price per minute.  average  price per
minute  has been  negatively  impacted  by the  competitive  forces  within  the
industry  which we expect to continue.  in  addition,  price per minute has been
negatively impacted by changes in product mix.

local voice service  revenues,  which  included  domestic acc revenues since its
acquisition  in april,  1998,  grew over 45% in the second quarter and grew over
65% for the first  half of 1999,  compared  with the  corresponding  prior  year
periods.  at&amp;t;'s integrated  business local  operations,  including at&amp;t; digital
link,  added  approximately  105 thousand  access  lines in the second  quarter,
bringing total access lines in service to approximately  868 thousand as of june
30, 1999.  at&amp;t; serves 26,723  buildings in 87  metropolitan  statistical  areas
(msas), up from 16,537 a year ago, with over 20% of the buildings on-net.

internal  revenues  increased 91.4% and 59.7% for the three and six months ended
june 30, 1999, respectively.  the increases were due to higher sales of business
long  distance  services  to other at&amp;t;  units,  primarily  at&amp;t;  solutions  and
wireless services, for resale to at&amp;t; solutions and wireless services customers.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda for business services increased to $1,459 million, or 30.4%, and
to $2,202  million,  or  28.7%,  respectively,  in the  second  quarter  of 1999
compared  with the  year-ago  quarter.  ebit and  ebitda for  business  services
increased  to  $3,026  million,  or  34.9%,  and to  $4,458  million,  or 32.6%,
respectively, for the first six months of 1999 compared with the prior year. the
increases were due to revenue growth and associated margin improvement.

other items
capital  additions for business services  increased $387 million,  or 31.7%, for
the second  quarter of 1999  compared with the second  quarter of 1998.  capital
additions  increased $319 million, or 14.6%, for the first half of 1999 compared
with the first half of 1998. the increase for both periods was primarily  driven
by the  expansion  of sonet,  in  support of data and ip,  and  business  local,
partially offset by lower capital spending on circuit switched equipment.

total assets  increased  $979 million,  or 4.6%, to $22,394  million at june 30,
1999, compared with december 31, 1998, primarily due to an increase in property,
plant and  equipment as a result of capital  additions  and  increased  accounts
receivable associated with higher revenues.

revenues
consumer  services  revenues  decreased  3.4% for both the three  and  six-month
periods ended june 30, 1999, compared with the same periods last year. excluding
at&amp;t;  worldnet  services,  revenues  were  down  3.9% and 3.8% for the three and
six-month periods ended june 30, 1999, respectively, while long distance calling
volumes  declined at a  mid-single-digit  rate for both  periods.  these results
reflect the competitive nature of the consumer long distance  industry,  and the
continued  impact  of at&amp;t;'s  strategy  to  migrate  higher-usage  customers  to
optional calling plans in order to optimize the customer base for future growth.

two key elements of at&amp;t;'s  strategy are to grow  revenues  through  transaction
services  and to bundle  services to attract  and retain  high usage  customers.
at&amp;t;'s  transaction  services  continue to grow rapidly led by prepaid services,
whose growth in the second  quarter was enhanced by the  acquisition  of certain
assets of smartalk teleservices (smarttalk). at&amp;t;'s bundled offer, at&amp;t; personal
network service, offers long distance,  wireless, calling card, and personal 800
services at a single rate per minute,  plus worldnet internet access, all on one
integrated  bill.   personal   network  has  seen  a  positive   response  since
introduction   in  the  first  quarter  of  1999  and  now  has  nearly  250,000
subscribers.

consumer  worldnet  services  revenues  increased 55.0% in the second quarter of
1999 over the year-ago quarter to $76 million.  revenues increased 48.1% for the
first half of 1999 to $141 million  compared  with the first half of 1998.  at&amp;t;
worldnet services now serves approximately 1.5 million residential  subscribers,
an increase of 45% from a year ago.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda for consumer services  increased 20.2% and 20.3%,  respectively,
in the second  quarter of 1999 compared with the second quarter of last year and
increased  30.7% and 29.6%,  respectively,  for the first half of 1999  compared
with  the  first  half of last  year.  ebit and  ebitda  for  consumer  services
excluding the first quarter gain on the sale of language  line  increased  25.3%
and 24.8%,  respectively,  for the first half of 1999 over the same  period last
year. the increases for both the quarter and year-to-date  periods excluding the
gain on the sale of language  line were  driven  primarily  by lower  negotiated
settlement rates and cost reduction efforts, primarily in marketing spending.

other items
capital additions for consumer services increased $70 million, or 87.2%, for the
second  quarter of 1999 compared with the second  quarter of 1998.  the increase
was  primarily due to greater  capital  expenditures  to expand  at&amp;t;'s  network
infrastructure. capital additions increased $59 million, or 30.0%, for the first
half of 1999  compared  with the first half of 1998.  the increase was primarily
due to increased capitalized software and greater capital expenditures to expand
at&amp;t;'s network infrastructure.

total assets  increased  $126  million,  or 1.9%,  to $6,687  million  primarily
associated with the purchase of smarttalk in the first quarter.

revenues
wireless  services  revenues  increased  $565 million,  or 43.1%,  in the second
quarter of 1999,  and increased  $963 million,  or 38.9%,  for the first half of
1999  compared  with same  periods  last year.  wireless  services  1999 results
include  vanguard  cellular  systems  (vanguard) since its acquisition on may 3,
1999,  and 1998 results  include our messaging  business  until the sale date of
october 2, 1998.  adjusted to exclude both vanguard and our messaging  business,
revenues grew 42.4% and 41.3% for the three and six-month periods ended june 30,
1999,  respectively,  compared with the prior year periods.  the growth for both
periods was driven by the  continued  successful  execution  of at&amp;t;'s  wireless
strategy of  targeting  and  retaining  high-value  subscribers,  expanding  the
national wireless  footprint,  focusing on digital service,  and offering simple
rate plans. at&amp;t;'s digital one rate service leverages all of the elements of the
wireless  strategy and  continues  to generate  significant  revenue  growth and
contribute  positively  to ebitda.  the number of at&amp;t;  digital one rate service
subscribers  grew to nearly 1.5 million in the second quarter of 1999, with over
80% of the net  additions  representing  new  wireless  customers  for at&amp;t.;  in
addition,  during the quarter, at&amp;t; introduced group calling for business, which
offers  simplicity and value with  unlimited  calling for a flat fee for "closed
user groups".

at&amp;t;  continues to  experience  strong  growth in wireless  subscribers  and net
subscriber  additions.  consolidated net additions increased 45.5% in the second
quarter of 1999 versus the second quarter of 1998 to over 473 thousand, bringing
consolidated subscribers,  including approximately 700 thousand subscribers from
our acquisition of vanguard, to a total of approximately 8.8 million at june 30,
1999,  up 35.4%  from a year  ago and up  15.9%  from  one  quarter  ago.  total
subscribers,  including  partnership  markets  in  which  at&amp;t;  does  not  own a
controlling interest, exceeded 11 million in the second quarter.

at&amp;t;'s  focus on  high-value  subscribers  has helped  generate  rising usage by
customers and increased  quarterly average revenue per user (arpu).  arpu across
all of at&amp;t;'s wireless  markets was $66.2 in the second quarter,  an increase of
15.3% from the second quarter of 1998 and a 9.2% increase from the first quarter
of 1999. this represents the third  consecutive  quarter arpu has increased over
the prior year.

we continue to rapidly  migrate  customers to digital  service,  generating more
efficient use of the network while also reducing  customer  churn. at the end of
the second quarter, 69.0% of at&amp;t;'s 8.8 million consolidated subscribers were on
digital service, up from 45.2% one year ago and up from 67.3% one quarter ago.

ebit/ebitda excluding other income
ebit was $52 million and $24 million for the three and six months ended june 30,
1999, respectively,  representing decreases of 73.7% and 88.7% over the year ago
periods.  the ebit decline for both periods was primarily due to increased costs
from higher off-network  roaming expenses,  and increased  customer  acquisition
costs associated with the high growth of subscriber additions. in addition, ebit
was also impacted by higher other income in 1998 due to the second  quarter gain
on the sale of smartone. ebitda excluding other income was $329 million and $531
million,  for the  three  and six  months  ended  june 30,  1999,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 18.3%  and 9.2%  over  the  year  ago  periods.  the
improvement for both periods was the result of revenue growth,  partially offset
by increased costs from higher off-network roaming expenses and greater customer
acquisition costs associated with the high growth of subscriber additions.

off-network  roaming expenses  continued to negatively impact results,  but have
been favorably  impacted as a result of  aggressively  capturing more minutes on
the at&amp;t; network as well as reducing  intercarrier roaming rates. at&amp;t; continues
to  address  off-network  usage  through  capital  expansion,  acquisitions  and
affiliate  launches.  capital  expansion  is underway  within  existing  and new
markets,  including columbus,  ohio; omaha, nebraska; san diego,  california and
certain connecticut cities. in may 1999, at&amp;t; completed it merger with vanguard,
adding  more  than 700  thousand  subscribers  and  increasing  at&amp;t;'s  wireless
coverage in suburban and rural markets in the ohio valley and northeastern  u.s.
in addition,  the announced acquisition of honolulu cellular closed on august 2,
1999. partnership  affiliations with cincinnati bell wireless,  triton, telecorp
and tritel further expand at&amp;t;'s time division multiple access (tdma) footprint.
intercarrier  roaming  rates  have also  declined  as a result  of  renegotiated
roaming  agreements and the deployment of intelligent  roaming  database  (irdb)
technology, which assists in identifying favorable roaming partners in areas not
included in our wireless network.

other items
capital  additions  increased $408 million,  or 164.8%, in the second quarter of
1999, compared with the second quarter of 1998. capital additions increased $422
million,  or 106.6% in the first half of 1999,  compared  with the first half of
1998.  these  increases  were the result of  additional  spending to upgrade and
increase capacity in existing markets.

total assets increased $2,273 million,  or 11.9%, to $21,388 million at june 30,
1999,  from  december 31, 1998.  the increase was due  primarily to increases in
goodwill,  property, plant and equipment and licensing costs associated with our
acquisitions  of  vanguard  and  bakersfield  cellular.  in  addition,  accounts
receivable were higher partially attributable to increased revenues.

revenues
revenues  for the  second  quarter  of 1999  excluding  the  impacts of the agns
acquisition were $392 million, an increase of 23.8% from the same quarter a year
ago.  revenues  for the first  half of 1999  excluding  the  impacts of the agns
acquisition were $743 million, an increase of 41.7% compared with the first half
of last year.  revenue  growth for both  periods  was  primarily  driven by at&amp;t;
solutions as a result of the  continued  strength of the  outsourcing  business.
international  operations  and ventures also  contributed  to the revenue growth
primarily  due to an  increase in  reorigination  and  transit  revenues.  these
increases  were  partially   offset  by  an  increase  in  the   elimination  of
intercompany revenues. additionally,  revenue growth for the year-to-date period
was partially offset by the sale of ascc in march 1998.

the elimination of revenues and profit generated by the sale of services between
business  segments is primarily a result of the sale of business  long  distance
services to other at&amp;t; units.  revenues  eliminated  in the second  quarter were
$401 million, an increase of 85.2% from the second quarter of 1998 and were $697
million  for the first six months of 1999,  an  increase  of 40.6% over the same
period  last  year.  the  increases  over 1998 were  primarily  due to  business
services sales to at&amp;t; solutions and wireless services.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda  were $37 million  and $202  million  for the second  quarter of
1999, representing increases of 101.2% and 107.0%, respectively, over the second
quarter of 1998. ebit and ebitda were deficits of $430 million and $140 million,
respectively,  for the  first  half of 1999  compared  with  deficits  of $3,344
million and $3,108 million in the same period of 1998.  excluding  restructuring
and other charges for both periods and the second  quarter 1999 gain on the sale
of wood-tv and first  quarter  1998 gains on the sales of ascc and lin-tv,  ebit
was a deficit of $130 million and ebitda was $35 million for the second  quarter
of 1999, an improvement of 51.6% and 122.6%,  respectively,  over the comparable
prior year  period.  ebit was a deficit of $460 million and ebitda was a deficit
of $170 million for the first half of 1999 on this same basis, an improvement of
31.2% and  60.8%,  respectively,  over the  comparable  prior year  period.  the
improvements  for both periods were  primarily due to lower  corporate  expenses
driven by cost cutting initiatives such as headcount  reductions.  additionally,
the   year-to-date   improvement   was  impacted  by  lower  equity  losses  for
international  partnerships  and  ventures.  the increases for both periods were
partially offset by higher interest income in 1998.

capital  additions were  essentially flat in the second quarter of 1999 compared
with the second quarter of last year. capital additions  increased $287 million,
or 109.9% for the first six months of 1999 compared with the first six months of
1998 primarily due to increased investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

total  assets at june 30,  1999,  were  $16,646  million  compared  with $12,459
million at december 31, 1998,  which  represents a 33.6% increase.  the increase
was primarily due to goodwill  associated with the acquisition of the ibm global
network.

revenues
at&amp;t;  solutions  grew revenues  161.3% for the second quarter of 1999 and 109.4%
for the first six  months of 1999  compared  with the  corresponding  prior year
periods.  excluding the impact of agns,  revenues grew 49.8% for the quarter and
50.5% for the first six  months of 1999.  the growth  for both  periods  was the
result  of  continued  strength  in  outsourcing  services.  in  addition,  at&amp;t;
solutions   manages  at&amp;t;'s  internal  network   infrastructure   and  generated
approximately  $423 million and $852 million in internal  billings in the second
quarter and for the first six months of 1999, respectively,  which were recorded
as a reduction to at&amp;t; solutions' expenses (cost recovery).

at&amp;t;  solutions,  with more  than  30,000  clients,  including  ibm,  citigroup,
mcgraw-hill, bank one, united health group, textron, j.p. morgan, merrill lynch,
and  mastercard  international,  has the  potential for more than $11 billion in
outsourcing revenues over the life of the signed contracts.  during the quarter,
at&amp;t; solutions also added safeco,  american  century and teachers  insurance and
annuity association as clients.

ebit/ebitda
excluding  the impact of agns,  ebit and ebitda were $10 million and $82 million
for the second quarter of 1999, respectively, an improvement over $5 million and
$73 million reported in the  corresponding  prior year quarter.  ebit and ebitda
were $21 million and $166  million on this basis for the first half of 1999,  an
improvement  over a deficit of $4 million  and a  positive  $131  million in the
first half of 1998.  the  improvement  for both  periods  was  primarily  due to
revenue growth in the existing at&amp;t; solutions' outsourcing unit partially offset
by higher expenses driven by the higher revenues.

other items
capital  additions for the second quarter of 1999 were $65 million,  an increase
of 94.1% over the second  quarter of 1998.  capital  additions for the first six
months of 1999 were $76  million,  an increase  of 34.3% over the  corresponding
prior year period.  the increases  were  primarily due to the addition of client
support equipment.

total assets  increased $4,372 million,  or 427.3%,  from december 31, 1998, due
primarily to goodwill associated with the acquisition of the ibm global network.

international operations and ventures
international  operations and ventures include  consolidated  foreign operations
such  as  at&amp;t;   communications   services  uk  (comms  uk),  acc,  transit  and
reorigination  businesses and international online services. the equity earnings
or losses of at&amp;t;'s nonconsolidated  international joint ventures and alliances,
such as alestra in mexico and at&amp;t; canada corp. are also included. as of june 1,
1999, at&amp;t; canada corp.  completed its merger with metronet  communication corp.
(metronet), canada's largest facilities-based competitive local exchange carrier
(clec). at&amp;t; now owns 31% of the combined company, at&amp;t; canada, and continues to
account for its ownership as an equity investment.  these results do not include
bilateral  international  long distance traffic,  which is reflected in business
services and consumer  services,  as appropriate.  the results of  international
operations and ventures are included in the other and corporate group.

revenues
revenues grew 22.2% in the second quarter of 1999 to $333 million and grew 38.7%
to $625  million in the first six months of 1999  compared  with the  respective
prior year periods. revenue growth for both periods was led by reorigination and
transit/interconnection  due to increased demand and the addition of new traffic
routes. the growth for the year-to-date period was also impacted by improvements
in frame relay and wholesale growth, and the purchase of acc in april 1998.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda  improved in the second quarter of 1999 by $123 million and $121
million,  respectively,  compared with the corresponding  prior year periods due
primarily to a net gain related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would
have  competed  directly  with  the  global  venture  at&amp;t; is  forming  with bt.
excluding the net gain,  ebit and ebitda  improved in the second quarter of 1999
by $55  million  and $53  million,  respectively,  due  primarily  to  improving
financial  performance in our  nonconsolidated  ventures and  alliances,  strong
revenues and volume growth in reorigination  and  transit/interconnect  services
and cost reduction efforts.

ebit and  ebitda  each  declined  in the first  half of 1999 by $63  million  to
deficits of $189 million and $151 million,  respectively.  the declines were due
primarily  to the 1999 net  charge  related to the exit of joint  ventures  that
would have competed  directly  with the global  venture at&amp;t; is forming with bt.
excluding the charges, ebit and ebitda improved during the period by $65 million
each,  due  primarily  to  improving  financial   performance  in  ventures  and
alliances,   strong   revenues   and   volume   growth  in   reorigination   and
transit/interconnect  services,  improved  performance  in the  frame  relay and
wholesale arenas and cost reduction efforts.

other items
capital  additions  were  essentially  flat for the  second  quarter of 1999 and
increased $292 million for the first six months of 1999,  compared with the same
periods last year. the increases were primarily due to increased  investments in
nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

total assets were $2,599 million at june 30, 1999,  compared with $1,915 million
at december  31,  1998.  the  increase  was  primarily  driven by an increase in
goodwill  due to our  investment  in  at&amp;t;  canada,  additional  investments  in
consolidated  subsidiaries and a higher cash balance associated with the gain on
sale of non-strategic investments in the second quarter.

net cash provided by operating  activities of continuing  operations for the six
months ended june 30, 1999, was $3,401  million.  this  represents a decrease of
$631 million compared with the first six months of 1998. the decrease was driven
primarily by an increase in the 1999 tax payments of approximately  $1.4 billion
primarily  related to the gain on the sale of ucs and an  increase  in  accounts
receivable,  partially  offset by an increase in operating net income  excluding
depreciation and amortization.

at&amp;t;'s investing  activities resulted in a net use of cash of $16,390 million in
the first half of 1999 compared  with a net source of cash of $8,428  million in
the first half of 1998.  during the first six months of 1999,  at&amp;t;  transferred
$5.5  billion of cash to liberty  media  group,  used $5.1  billion  for capital
expenditures,  purchased portions of the ibm global network for $4.2 billion and
loaned $1.5 billion to mediaone to pay termination  fees to comcast.  during the
first half of 1998,  we received $5.7 billion as a settlement of a receivable in
conjunction  with the sale of ucs as well as $3.5  billion in proceeds  from the
sale.  we also  received a total of $1.6  billion in proceeds  from the sales of
lin-tv,  ascc and  smartone in the first half of 1998.  our capital  spending of
$3.4 billion was the primary use of cash in the first six months of 1998.

during the first half of 1999, the net cash provided by financing activities was
$10,247  million  compared  with cash  used in  financing  activities  of $5,025
million in the first half of 1998.  during the first half of 1999, at&amp;t; received
$7.9  billion of cash from a march 1999 bond  issuance,  $5.0  billion  from the
issuance  of  convertible  securities  and  warrants  to  microsoft  corporation
(microsoft) and $3.3 billion from the issuance of commercial  paper.  from this,
$3.9  billion was used to fund the share  repurchase  program,  $2.0 billion was
used to retire  commercial  paper and other short-term debt and $1.3 billion was
used to pay dividends on common stock.  in the first half of 1998,  cash used in
financing  activities  was largely  attributable  to the pay down of  commercial
paper.

ebitda  is a  measure  of our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow and  should  be
considered  in  addition  to, but not as a  substitute  for,  other  measures of
financial  performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. ebitda increased $4,501 million, or 107.5%, for the six months ended
june 30, 1999, compared with the same period in 1998. excluding ab&amp;is;, agns, the
restructuring  and other  charges,  and gains on sales of businesses in 1999 and
1998,  ebitda  increased 31.3% to $8,875 million in the first six months of 1999
from $6,761 million for the first six months of 1998. the increase was primarily
due to increased  revenues in business  services and cost reductions in consumer
services and corporate overhead.

euro conversion
on january 1, 1999,  certain  members of the european  union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the european  union's
currency (euro).  the transition period is anticipated to extend between january
1, 1999,  and july 1, 2002.  we have  assessed the impact of the  conversion  on
information-technology  systems,  currency  exchange rate risk,  derivatives and
other financial instruments,  continuity of material contracts as well as income
tax and accounting issues. we do not expect the conversion during the transition
period to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

financial condition
total assets increased  $85,688 million,  or 143.9%, to $145,238 million at june
30, 1999,  compared with december 31, 1998. the increase in total assets was due
primarily to our  acquisition of tci, which resulted in an investment in liberty
media  group  of $35  billion,  increased  goodwill,  and an  increase  in other
investments including cablevision,  excite@home and lenfest communications, inc.
the  acquisition  of tci also  resulted  in the  addition  of over $6 billion to
property,  plant and  equipment.  other  assets also  increased  by $1.5 million
representing  the comcast  break-up fee loaned to mediaone by at&amp;t.; in addition,
we recognized  goodwill  related to our  acquisition of the ibm global  network.
these increases were partially  offset by a net decrease in cash, which was used
to partially  fund the first  quarter  share  repurchase,  capital  expenditures
during the period and the acquisition of the ibm global network.

total  liabilities  increased  $29,070 million,  or 85.7%, to $62,989 million at
june 30, 1999,  compared with december 31, 1998.  the increase was due primarily
to the acquisition of tci,  particularly debt and deferred income taxes, an $8.0
billion bond offering and the issuance of commercial paper.

in addition,  at&amp;t; issued $5.0 billion of quarterly convertible income preferred
securities (recorded net of a $0.3 million discount) to microsoft.

total  shareowners'  equity  increased  $47,966 million,  or 187.9%,  to $73,488
million at june 30, 1999,  compared with december 31, 1998. the increase was due
primarily to the issuance of shares  related to the tci  acquisition,  partially
offset by shares repurchased.

at&amp;t; group's  ratio of total debt to total  capital at june 30, 1999,  was 41.9%
compared  with  20.9% at  december  31,  1998.  equity  includes  the $5 billion
convertible  securities  issued to microsoft  and debt  includes $1.7 billion of
non-convertible  securities issued by tci's subsidiary  trusts. the increase was
primarily driven by an increase in debt associated with the tci merger and an $8
billion bond issuance in march 1999,  partially  offset by a higher equity base.
at&amp;t; group's net debt-to-operational ebitda was 1.65x at june 30, 1999, compared
with 0.24x at december 31, 1998.

risk management
we are exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign  exchange
rates.  on a limited  basis we use  certain  derivative  financial  instruments,
including interest rate swaps, options,  forwards and other derivative contracts
to manage  these  risks.  we do not use  financial  instruments  for  trading or
speculative  purposes.  all financial  instruments  are used in accordance  with
board-approved policies.

assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest rates at june 30, 1999, the potential
loss for changes in fair value of unhedged debt would have been $1.0 billion.

at&amp;t; has a $20 billion  commitment from multiple lenders with credit  agreements
to be  finalized  upon  consummation  of the  proposed  merger with the mediaone
group.

recent pronouncements
in june 1998,  the  financial  accounting  standards  board issued sfas no. 133,
"accounting  for derivative  instruments and hedging  activities.  " among other
provisions, it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets
or  liabilities  in the  statement  of  financial  position  and  measure  those
instruments at fair value.  gains and losses  resulting from changes in the fair
values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. this effective date of
this standard was delayed via the issuance of sfas no. 137. the  effective  date
for sfas no. 133 is now for fiscal years beginning  after june 15, 2000,  though
earlier  adoption is encouraged and retroactive  application is prohibited.  for
at&amp;t; this means that the standard must be adopted no later than january 1, 2001.
management  does not expect the  adoption  of this  standard  to have a material
impact on at&amp;t;'s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

year 2000
at&amp;t; is  preparing  its systems and  applications  for the year 2000 (y2k).  the
issue our y2k program  addresses is the use of a two-digit year field instead of
a  four-digit  year  field in  computer  systems.  if  computer  systems  cannot
distinguish  between the year 1900 and the year 2000,  system  failures or other
computer  errors could  result.  the potential for failures and errors spans all
aspects of our business,  including  computer systems,  voice and data networks,
and  building   infrastructures.   we  are  also  faced  with   addressing   our
interdependencies  with our suppliers,  connecting carriers and major customers,
all of whom face the same issue.

<page>
                                                         at&amp;t; form 10-q - part i

at&amp;t;'s company-wide y2k program is focused on four interrelated categories which
are   critical  to   maintaining   uninterrupted   service  to  our   customers:
at&amp;t-developed;  applications  and  their  external  interfaces,  at&amp;t;  networks,
information-technology (it) platforms that support the applications,  and non-it
infrastructure.

at&amp;t;'s  progress in our y2k program is  measured  by certain key  milestones  or
phases common to each category of systems.  these  milestones  are:  assessment,
repair/remediation,  testing and  certification.  at&amp;t;  monitors  and tracks the
progress  of our y2k program  through a series of  scorecards  that  capture the
activities related to the y2k process phases.

as of june 30, 1999,  at&amp;t;'s  network  services  (excluding  recently  completed
acquisitions)  are year 2000  compliant.  this means they have been assessed for
year 2000 impacts,  repaired if necessary,  tested and fully  deployed.  for all
other systems encompassed in our y2k program, at&amp;t; anticipates completion of all
phases by the third quarter of 1999,  which is an extension of our previous time
frame due  primarily  due to the impact of  acquisitions  and  vendor  delays in
delivering y2k-compliant  software/hardware.  the status of tci's y2k program is
discussed  separately  from the existing at&amp;t; program.  all targets cited herein
also exclude  information  regarding  pending  acquisitions,  whose programs are
still being  evaluated  and planned for  integration  into the overall  at&amp;t; y2k
program.

program status
at&amp;t; now has over 3,500  applications that (1) directly support at&amp;t;'s voice and
data  telecommunications  services  (including  wired  and  wireless);  (2)  are
critical  to  the   provisioning,   administration,   maintenance  and  customer
service/support related to our telecommunications  services; and (3) support our
sales  and   marketing   organizations,   other  at&amp;t;   services   and  internal
administrative functions. these applications represent over 380 million lines of
code. as of june 30, 1999,  at&amp;t; has completed 100% of the assessment and repair
and about 98% of the application  testing.  the  certification and deployment of
these applications is targeted for completion in the third quarter of 1999.

with respect to external (third-party) interface assessment, formal letters were
sent to about 2,000  domestic  telecommunications  companies  and  international
telecommunications  authorities  to request  information  on their y2k plans and
targets  for  compliance.  we have  identified  over  1,000  different  types of
third-party  interfaces and about 10,000 total  instances of those types.  as of
june 30, 1999,  at&amp;t; has assessed  approximately  99% of  third-party  interface
types, and  approximately  98% are y2k compliant.  we expect to be 100% complete
with y2k certification of external interfaces in the third quarter of 1999.

the at&amp;t; network is critical to providing top-quality,  reliable service to at&amp;t;
customers. at june 30, 1999, the assessment,  repair and certification phases of
the operation-support  systems (os) were 100% complete and these systems are now
fully deployed.  in addition to the at&amp;t-developed;  applications  supporting the
network,  at&amp;t; has  inventoried  about 2,000  unique  types  (manufactured/model
combinations)  externally  purchased  network elements (ne) including  switches,
routers,  network-control  points and  signal-transfer  points.  additional  y2k
testing is conducted to independently verify supplier claims of compliance.  all
of the nes are now  certified.  after  os/ne  certification  is  complete,  at&amp;t;
performs  integration  testing to verify y2k certification of nes in conjunction
with the associated os applications.  such integration testing is 100% completed
as of june 30, 1999, and all of the nes are fully deployed.

the it infrastructure  category addresses not only the computing  platforms that
are critical to the  at&amp;t-developed;  applications,  but also the common modules,
communications  protocols,  the internal at&amp;t; wide-area and local-area networks,
desktop  hardware/software  and the internal voice network. as of june 30, 1999,
at&amp;t; was approximately 96% compliant in computing platforms, about 94% compliant
in desktops,  approximately  98% compliant in voice  systems and  adjuncts,  and
about  99%  compliant  in  data  networks.  at&amp;t;  anticipates  completion  of it
infrastructure certification by the third quarter of 1999.

the non-it  infrastructure  focuses on the  energy-  and  environment-management
systems  that are  critical  to  various  computer  systems,  as well as safety,
security and operations.  this aspect of the y2k program  encompasses  more than
9,000 sites,  as well as about 7,000  wireless cell sites.  as of june 30, 1999,
approximately  98% of all sites  completed  inventory and about 94% are assessed
and compliant (or not impacted).  at&amp;t; has targeted 100% site  compliance by the
third quarter of 1999.

in addition, at&amp;t; is continuing network interoperability tests with a variety of
domestic  and  international  testing  partners.  these  tests are  designed  to
exercise the network  across a range of our vendors,  and across a range of at&amp;t;
voice,  private line, and data  services.  we are also testing with key customer
and  industry   segments,   including   the  financial   community,   insurance,
transportation,  manufacturing  and others.  all test  results to date have been
positive.

similar to at&amp;t;'s y2k  program,  the tci program has a  four-phased  approach to
determining the readiness of systems for y2k, namely;  assessment,  remediation,
testing and implementation.  we anticipate  substantial completion of all phases
of tci's  program  by the third  quarter  of 1999.  tci is also  continuing  its
efforts to verify  the year 2000  readiness  of its  significant  suppliers  and
vendors and continued to  communicate  with  significant  business  partners and
affiliates to assess such partners and affiliates' year 2000 status.

costswe have expended  approximately $600 million since inception in 1997 on all
phases of the y2k project.  this figure  includes  approximately  $98 million of
costs  incurred  during the second quarter of 1999, of which  approximately  $14
million represented  capital spending for upgrading and replacing  non-compliant
computer  systems  and  network  components.  less than  half of the 1999  costs
represent  internal it resources that have been  redeployed  from other projects
and are expected to return to these projects upon completion of the y2k project.
we  anticipate  remaining  y2k costs for 1999,  inclusive of  approximately  $69
million projected expenditures  associated with completing the tci program, will
be  approximately  $156 million.  this  projection  includes  approximately  $50
million of capitalized costs.

risk assessment
we have  assessed our business  exposure that would result from a failure of our
y2k program,  as well as those of our suppliers,  connecting  carriers and major
customers.  such  failures  would  result in  business  consequences  that could
include failure to be able to serve  customers,  loss of network  functionality,
inability to render accurate bills, lost revenues, harm to the at&amp;t; brand, legal
and regulatory exposure, and failure of management controls. although we believe
that internal y2k  compliance  will be achieved no later than december 31, 1999,
there can be no assurance that the y2k problem will not have a material  adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

contingency plans
at&amp;t;'s  contingency  planning program focuses on 38 critical business  processes
and many more that are designated as "important" or "support". the plans address
all    facets    of    business    continuity,    including    key    suppliers,
systems/applications,  it infrastructure and work centers.  specific examples of
at&amp;t;'s contingency plan initiatives include the following:

plans are under way to engineer additional network capacity and to position at&amp;t;
personnel  on site at  critical  locations  to  monitor  operations  and  manage
increases in work and call volumes.

agreements  are being  negotiated  with  contractors  and  vendors to ensure the
availability of on-site technical support.  this coverage  includes,  but is not
limited to, network centers and sites, customer-care centers and data centers.

we  are  planning  to   proactively   stage   power,   fuel,   water,   heating,
air-conditioning and ventilation sources to support critical business operations
and personnel requirements.

alternate  procedures  and  processes  are being  developed to support  critical
customer functions,  including alternative procedures for rapid repair, recovery
and restoration of critical technology components by business resumption teams.

procedures to perform database backups,  hardcopy printouts,  data retention and
recovery are being established for business critical data.

risk management
in  addition  to the  contingency  planning  program,  at&amp;t; has  implemented  an
independent verification and validation program for applications to validate the
quality  of  application  remediation  and  testing,  as well as the  continuing
compliance  of systems  put back into  production.  we also  continue to conduct
independent audits across critical areas of the y2k program.

other matters
on april 30, 1999,  at&amp;t;  completed its  acquisition  of the ibm global  network
(ign) business and its assets in the united states. the acquisition is occurring
in phases  throughout 1999 as legal and regulatory  requirements are met in each
of the 59  countries  in which  the  business  operates.  in june of  1999,  the
acquisitions  of the ign business in japan,  the united kingdom and ireland were
completed.  the acquisition  has been accounted for as a purchase.  accordingly,
the operating results of the ign business have been included in the accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  since the date of  acquisition.  intangible
assets of approximately  $3.9 billion including customer lists and the excess of
the  purchase  price  over  the fair  value of net  assets  acquired  are  being
amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods ranging from five-30 years. the
pro forma impact of the ign business  results on historical at&amp;t; results are not
material.

on may 3, 1999,  at&amp;t;  closed the  previously  announced  merger  with  vanguard
cellular systems,  inc.  (vanguard).  consummation of the merger resulted in the
issuance of  approximately  12.6 million at&amp;t; shares and payment of $485 million
in cash. in addition, vanguard had approximately $550 million in debt, which was
subsequently  repaid  by at&amp;t.;  the  merger  with  vanguard  was  recorded  as a
purchase.  accordingly  the operating  results of vanguard have been included in
the   accompanying   consolidated   financial   statements  since  the  date  of
acquisition. the pro forma impact of vanguard results on historical at&amp;t; results
are not material.

on june 1, 1999,  at&amp;t; canada  completed  the  announced  merger  with  metronet
communications corp. (metronet),  canada's largest facilities-based  competitive
local exchange carrier (clec).  the combined companies were renamed at&amp;t; canada.
at&amp;t; owns a 31% stake in the merged entity, which maintains a national network
to provide canadian business customers with local and long distance voice, data,
internet and electronic  commerce  services as well as wireless services through
rogers cantel at&amp;t.;

on june 7, 1999,  at&amp;t; signed a definitive  agreement  with cox  communications,
inc. (cox) whereby cox will exchange its at&amp;t; stock for cable television systems
that  serve   approximately   495,000   customers  as  well  as  certain   other
consideration, including cash. based on the closing price of at&amp;t; stock when the
agreement  was  announced,  the  transaction  is  valued at  approximately  $2.8
billion.  the agreement  has been  approved by the boards of both  companies and
will be subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals.

on june 29, 1999,  the  previously  announced  global  venture  between at&amp;t; and
british  telecommunications  plc (bt) received  approval  from the u.s.  justice
department.  the  venture  has  already  received  approval  from  the  european
commission.   the  global  venture  will  combine  the  transborder  assets  and
operations of each company.  the venture will be equally owned by both companies
when  it  begins  operations.  the  receipt  of  certain  additional  regulatory
approvals  is required and the venture is expected to be completed in the second
half of 1999.

on may 28, 1999, at home corporation consummated a merger agreement with excite,
inc.  (excite),  a global  internet  media  company  that offers  consumers  and
advertisers   comprehensive   internet   navigation   services  with   extensive
personalization  capabilities.  under the terms of the merger agreement, at home
corporation  issued  approximately  116 million  shares of its common  stock (as
adjusted for a june 1999 stock split) for all of the outstanding common stock of
excite based on an exchange  ratio of 2.083804  shares of at home  corporation's
common  stock  (as  adjusted  for a june 1999  stock  split)  for each  share of
excite's common stock. as a result of the merger, at&amp;t;'s economic interest in at
home  corporation  (excite@home)  decreased  from  38.8%  to  26.5%.  due to the
resulting  increase  in  excite@home's  equity,  net of the  dilution  of at&amp;t;'s
ownership  interest in  exite@home,  at&amp;t;  recorded a $466  million  increase to
additional paid in capital.  at june 30, 1999, at&amp;t; owned  63,720,000  shares of
excite@home  class a common  stock (as adjusted for a june 1999 stock split) and
has an approximate  58% voting  interest on certain  matters.  during the second
quarter of 1999, the stockholders of excite@home approved certain changes in the
corporate  governance of excite@home.  as a result of these changes,  management
has  concluded  that at&amp;t; no longer holds a  controlling  financial  interest in
excite@home and, accordingly,  during the second quarter of 1999, at&amp;t; ceased to
consolidate  excite@home and began to account for  excite@home  using the equity
method of accounting.  the effect of this  deconsolidation was immaterial to the
consolidated financial statements of at&amp;t.;

subsequent events

on august 2, 1999, at&amp;t; completed its acquisition of honolulu cellular telephone
company from bellsouth.

on august 5, 1999,  at&amp;t; and bt announced  that they will jointly  acquire a 33%
stake  in  rogers  cantel  mobile   communications   inc.  (rogers  cantel)  for
approximately $934 million in cash. the investment will be owned equally by at&amp;t;
and bt.  at&amp;t; and bt also  announced  that bt will  acquired  30% of at&amp;t;'s  31%
ownership interest in at&amp;t; canada for approximately  $402 million.  in addition,
rogers cantel and at&amp;t; canada will  accelerate the bundling and joint  marketing
of wired and wireless services for canadian business  customers.  the closing of
these transactions is expected to take place in late august 1999.

item 2(c).  changes in securities and use of proceeds.
on june 16, 1999, in a private  placement  transaction  exempt from registration
pursuant  to  section  4(2) of the  securities  act of 1933,  as  amended,  as a
transaction  not  involving a public  offering,  the company  sold to  microsoft
corporation for an aggregate  price of $5 billion newly issued at&amp;t;  convertible
trust  preferred  securities  with an  aggregate  face  amount of $5 billion and
warrants to purchase 40 million shares of at&amp;t; common stock.

the  convertible  trust  preferred  securities bear interest at a rate of 5% per
annum,  payable  quarterly,  are  convertible  into 66.7 million  shares of at&amp;t;
common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $75 per share, have a
maturity  of 30 years,  and the  conversion  feature  can be  terminated,  under
certain conditions, after three years. the warrants will be exercisable in three
years to purchase 40 million at&amp;t; common shares at $75 per share. alternatively,
the warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis.

there were no underwriting discounts or commissions.  the company intends to use
the proceeds to fund working capital and capital expenditures.
