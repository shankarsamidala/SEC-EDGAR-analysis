item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations
 
overview
 
     the company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of nationally
branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in
the $60 billion to $70 billion north american office products industry. the
company offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file
folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products. through its
ampad division, the company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other
paper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers and retail
envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office products
distributors. through its williamhouse division, the company is the leading
supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes to paper
merchants and distributors. the company believes that its future operating
results will not be directly comparable to its historical operating results
because of its strategic acquisitions. the company's business has not generally
been seasonal in nature. certain factors which have affected, and may affect
prospectively, the operating results of the company are discussed below.
 
     strategic acquisitions. on october 31, 1995, the company acquired
williamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and fastest
growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumption of
debt) of approximately $300.7 million plus reimbursement of certain expenses to
the sellers. on june 28, 1996, the company acquired niagara, a national supplier
of envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $53.2 million, including costs of the acquisition and a $5 million
one year consulting agreement with niagara's former president. with these
acquisitions, the company became the largest supplier of envelopes to the
national paper merchants. the williamhouse acquisition was financed through the
company's old bank credit agreement and the assumption of senior subordinated
notes. the niagara acquisition was financed with proceeds from the sale of the
personalizing division of williamhouse.
 
     on february 11, 1997, the company acquired shade/allied, a national
supplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. the purchase
price of $50.7 million was financed with borrowings under the company's bank
credit agreement. shade/allied's products are distributed by both the ampad and
williamhouse divisions and the manufacturing plants are integrated into the
ampad division. this acquisition provided the company with a more significant
position in a fourth product category.
 
     on august 16, 1995, the company acquired the file folder and hanging file
product lines of atapco's globe-weis office products division. atapco was one of
the leading providers of file folders and hanging files to office products
superstores. the aggregate acquisition consideration of $20.0 million, including
fees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and seller
notes. the globe-weis acquisition further strengthened the company's position in
the filing supplies and writing products categories.
 
     purchase accounting effects. the company's acquisitions have been accounted
for using the purchase accounting method. the acquisitions have currently
affected, and will prospectively affect, the company's results of operations in
certain significant respects. the aggregate acquisition costs (including
assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair
market value of such net assets. the allocations of the purchase price result in
an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results in
incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year.
 
     raw material. the company's principal raw material is paper. certain
commodity grades utilized by the company have shown considerable price
volatility since 1992. this volatility negatively impacted the company's
earnings in 1994 as a result of the company's inability to implement price
changes in many of its product lines without giving its customers advance
notification. beginning in january 1995, the company adopted new pricing
policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the company's cost of
paper at the time of shipment. from may 1997 through october 1997, all but one
of the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the company increased in cost
between 6% and 18%. due to strategic customer considerations and competitive
market conditions, the company did not begin to recover a significant portion of
the increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until december 1997.
the company continued to
 
                                       23
<page>   16
 
implement sales pricing increases during the first quarter of 1998. paper price
volatility is expected to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost of
sales and there is no assurance that the company will not be materially affected
by future fluctuations in the price of paper. fluctuations in paper prices can
have an effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and
financial condition of the company.
 
results of operations
 
     the following table summarizes the company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for each year in the three year period
ended december 31, 1997. the company's historical results of operations for each
of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the following
businesses acquired by the company: (i) the results of globe-weiss which was
acquired august 16, 1995; (ii) williamhouse which was acquired on october 31,
1995; (iii) niagara which was acquired on june 28, 1996; and (iv) shade/allied
which was acquired on february 11, 1997.

year ended december 31, 1997 compared to year ended december 31, 1996
 
     net sales increased from $583.9 million in 1996 to $687.3 million in 1997,
an increase of $103.4 or 17.7%. of this sales increase, $67.4 million is due to
the acquisition of shade/allied and $50.1 million is due to the inclusion of a
full year of sales from the acquisition of niagara. excluding sales generated by
the shade/allied and niagara acquisitions, sales from the ampad division
increased $14.6 million and sales from the williamhouse division declined $28.5
million. the increase in sales from the ampad division is due primarily to
increased sales volume with the office products superstores and mass market
retail customers. the sales decline for the williamhouse division is primarily
due to lower average selling prices in 1997 due to competitive market conditions
during the year and partly to lower volumes of envelopes sold.
 
     gross profit decreased from $125.4 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 1996
to $96.9 million, or 14.1% of net sales, in 1997. this $28.5 million decrease is
primarily due to increased paper, material and labor costs which the company did
not recover. during 1997, the company's gross profit in the ampad division was
negatively affected by sales price incentives provided to the division's rapidly
growing office superstores and mass merchants. additionally, the company's gross
profit in the williamhouse division was negatively affected by competitive
market sales pricing conditions. these factors combined with higher material and
labor costs led to significantly lower gross profit in 1997 than in 1996. during
1997, the company incurred approximately $2.8 million in one-time costs relating
to training personnel on new equipment, the training
 
                                       24

time needed to expand to 24 hour 7 day shifts and the move to the new salt lake
facility. additionally, the company incurred $1.2 million in fixed costs in 1997
for former shade/allied and williamhouse plants which were closed during 1997
and will not recur in 1998.
 
     during the fourth quarter of 1997, the company announced that it would
incur additional charges due to annual revisions to the lifo reserve and
revisions to cost of sales estimates primarily for the williamhouse division.
these revisions resulted in $13.4 million of additional operating costs. such
revisions for the williamhouse division reflected the effects of higher paper
costs.
 
     selling and marketing expenses increased from $17.0 million in 1996 to
$21.9 million in 1997, or $4.9 million. of this increase, $1.1 million is
attributable to the acquisition of shade/allied and the retention of a portion
of their sales force and customer service personnel and $3.1 million is
primarily attributable to the niagara acquisition and the integration of its
sales force and customer service personnel into the williamhouse division. the
remainder of the increase is attributable to the ampad division, primarily due
to increased sales commissions associated with higher sales.
 
     general and administrative expenses increased from $24.4 million in 1996 to
$27.5 million in 1997, or $3.1 million. of this increase, $0.8 million is
attributable to the acquisition of shade/allied and the remainder is
attributable to increases in corporate expenses associated with the
centralization of certain functions in dallas. during 1997, the company incurred
$2.2 million of expenses related to shade/allied which will not recur in 1998.
 
     losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $1.8 million in 1996
to $3.0 million in 1997 due to a higher average level of accounts receivable
sold to the third party trust during 1997. following the acquisition of niagara
in june 1996, the maximum amount of accounts receivable which the company could
sell to the third party trust at any point in time was raised from $45 million
to $60 million. during 1997, the average level of accounts receivable sold to
the trust was higher than in 1996 and, as a result the losses on sales of
accounts receivable were higher. the losses on sales of accounts receivable
represent the company's cost of using the third party trust to provide off
balance sheet financing of trade accounts receivable.
 
     goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense increased from $4.5
million in 1996 to $6.1 million in 1997, an increase of $1.6 million, due
primarily to a full year of amortization of goodwill associated with the
acquisition of niagara and ten and one-half months of amortization of goodwill
associated with the acquisition of shade/allied.
 
     management fees and services expense for the year ended december 31, 1996
amounted to $3.9 million as compared to $4.9 million for the year ended december
31, 1997. the change in management fees is due primarily to the capitalization
of $0.8 million in bain capital fees in 1996 related to the acquisition of
shade/ allied.
 
     interest expense decreased from $43.0 million in 1996 to $37.8 million in
1997, representing a decrease of $5.2 million. such decrease was due primarily
to the refinancing of the company's credit agreement in july 1996, which
resulted in lower effective interest rates generating an interest savings of
$5.1 million, and the repayment of $70.0 million in senior subordinated notes in
august 1996, which led to an interest expense reduction of approximately $5.5
million. these savings were offset by $3.4 million additional interest expense
due to increases in long-term debt associated with the acquisition of
shade/allied and approximately $2.5 million additional interest expense as a
result of the company's investment in working capital and net increase in
capital expenditures.
 
     the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 1997 reflects an
effective income tax provision rate of 16.7% as compared with the effective
income tax rate of 43.2% for the year ended december 31, 1996. in 1997, the
company's loss before income taxes was relatively low, $3.8 million, in
comparison to the amount of expenses which are not deductible, $5.4 million.
such expenses primarily consist of goodwill amortization, certain travel and
entertainment costs and life insurance for certain current and former employees.
as a result, the company has taxable income for tax reporting purposes versus a
loss for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, the company has incurred a
tax provision for 1997. the company
 
                                       25
<page>   18
 
paid $4.5 million in income taxes during 1997, received an income tax refund of
$3.3 million in january 1998 and expects a refund of $0.8 million in state
income taxes during the second half of 1998.
 
year ended december 31, 1996 compared to year ended december 31, 1995
 
     net sales for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased by $326.7 million,
or 127.0%, to $583.9 million from $257.2 million for the year ended december 31,
1995. of this net sales increase, $274.8 million is related to the acquisition
of williamhouse and niagara and $35.2 million is related to the acquisition of
globe-weis. ampad division net sales increased by $16.7 million during 1996
compared to 1995 due to higher sales to the fast growing customer channels such
as superstores, mass merchant stores and contract stationers.
 
     gross profit for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased by $77.9
million, or 164.0%, to $125.4 million from $47.5 million for the year ended
december 31, 1995. approximately $69.5 million of the increase in gross profit
is attributable to the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara. gross profit
margin increased to 21.5% for the year ended december 31, 1996 from 18.5% for
the year ended december 31, 1995. the increase in gross profit margin is
primarily attributable to higher margins of the williamhouse division.
 
     selling and marketing expenses increased from $6.3 million in 1995 to $17.0
million in 1996, an increase of $10.7 million. of this increase, $9.1 million is
due to the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara and $1.6 million is due to
increased selling and marketing expense for the ampad division resulting from a
higher level of sales in this division.
 
     general and administrative expenses increased from $10.4 million in 1995 to
$24.4 million in 1996, an increase of $14.0 million. of this increase, $8.5
million is associated with the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara. the
remainder is associated with the implementation of a corporate infrastructure as
the company expanded in size.
 
     goodwill and intangible asset amortization increased from $0.9 million in
1995 to $4.5 million in 1996, or an increase of $3.6 million, as a result of the
acquisitions of williamhouse in october 1995 and niagara in june 1996.
 
     losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $0.4 million to $1.8
million in 1996 due primarily to having the accounts receivable securitization
facility in place for a full year in 1996. such charge represents the losses on
sales of trade accounts receivable from the company to a third party trust and
represents the cost to the company of using an off balance sheet financing
facility for trade accounts receivable.
 
     management fees and services increased $3.3 million in 1996 due to the
amortization of a consulting agreement with a former shareholder of niagara and
an increase in bain capital's management fees.
 
     interest expense for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased $29.3
million to $43.0 million from $13.7 million for the year ended december 31,
1995. the increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstanding
debt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of williamhouse and
globe-weis. the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction
of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense following the redemption of
$70.0 million of the senior subordinated notes in august 1996.
 
     the income tax provision for year ended december 31, 1996 reflects an
effective tax rate of 43.2% versus an effective tax benefit rate of 56.5% for
the year ended december 31, 1995. the effective tax rate for 1996 reflects a 40%
combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for nondeductible
expenses, primarily goodwill amortization. the effective tax rate for the year
ended december 31, 1995 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of
35% due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the company's net operating
loss carryforward.
 
     extraordinary item in 1996 represents an after tax loss on extinguishment
of debt of $20.0 million ($33.0 million pretax) recognized as a result of the
redemption of $70.0 million of senior subordinated notes with a portion of the
net proceeds from the initial public offering and the write off of a portion of
the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the notes and all of the
deferred financing costs associated with the old bank credit agreement and the
old accounts receivable facility.

liquidity and capital resources
 
     cash used by operating activities in 1997 amounted to $62.4 million and
consisted of (i) cash generated from the net loss, after adding back non-cash
charges of $21.1 million, (ii) cash used to fund increases in accounts
receivable of $17.3 million relating to higher sales in 1997 than in 1996.,
(iii) cash used to fund increases in inventories of $44.2 million manufactured
in anticipation of higher sales (iv) an increase in accounts payable of $4.6
million and (v) a decrease in accrued expenses of $22.0 million due primarily to
changes in acquisition integration cost reserves ($8.2 million), reduced
incentive compensation due to payment of bonuses earned in 1996 and no bonus
compensation for 1997 ($4.6 million) and reductions in customer incentive
liabilities due to the timing of the payments to customers ($8.5 million).
charges to the acquisition integration cost reserves consisted primarily of
plant closing, lease termination and severance costs associated with facilities
which have been closed and consolidated into the company's existing operations.
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 1996 was
$23.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 million
for the year ended december 31, 1995. the increase in cash provided by operating
activities is primarily due to higher net sales and earnings of the company in
1996. the net cash provided for the year ended december 31, 1995 resulted
primarily from an increase of $5.0 million in accounts payable, an increase in
accrued expenses of $4.9 million, a decrease in inventories and increased
margins on sales.
 
     cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 1997 was
due to the acquisition of shade/allied for $50.7 million and purchases of
property and equipment for $23.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales of
equipment and a closed plant for $4.1 million. cash used in investing activities
for the year ended december 31, 1996 and 1995 was $16.2 million and $131.3
million, respectively. the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 1996 was
principally due to the niagara acquisition ($53.0 million, net of cash received)
and purchases of equipment ($14.6 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of
the regency division and other assets held for sale ($49.3 million). the use of
cash for the year ended december 31, 1995, was due to the williamhouse
acquisition ($122.7 million), the globe-weis acquisition ($7.0 million) and
purchase of equipment ($3.9 million).
 
     cash was provided by financing activities in 1997 by increased borrowing
under the company's revolving credit agreement of $130.4 million offset by $2.3
million in payments on industrial revenue bonds and capitalized lease
obligations. at the end of 1997, the company had sold an additional $6 million
of accounts receivable to the third party trust. cash used in financing
activities for the year ended december 31, 1996 was $23.0 million as compared to
a cash provision from financing activities of $144.9 million for the year ended
december 31, 1995. during the year ended december 31, 1996, the company (i)
completed its initial public offering of 12.5 million shares of common stock for
$172.8 million in net proceeds after deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii)
refinanced its accounts receivable facility with a new $60.0 million facility,
(iii) refinanced its bank credit agreement, (iv) redeemed $70.0 million of
senior subordinated notes, (v) repaid $95.8 million of debt incurred under the
old bank credit agreement, (vi) paid $7.7 million in redemption premiums on the
notes, (vii) repaid $10 million under the new accounts receivable facility with
proceeds from the sale of the regency division, (viii) borrowed $54 million
under the new accounts receivable facility and (ix) repaid wr seller notes for
$25 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december
31, 1995 was $144.9 million primarily due to periodic financings incurred in
connection with the various acquisitions.
 
     in february 1998, the company and its banking group agreed to an increase
in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
million for a period of one year. after such time, the level of debt available
under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. in december 1997
and february 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were also modified
at the end of 1997 and for a one year period ending in february 1999. the
company will not be subject to a consolidated debt to ebitda ratio until the
first quarter of 1999. interest coverage ratios will be measured quarterly
beginning january 1, 1998. unless approved by the banking group, the company
will be restricted to $15.0 million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and
will be restricted from any acquisitions. the interest cost incurred by the
company will vary each quarter in 1998 depending on the company's consolidated
debt to ebitda ratio at the beginning of each quarter. the company paid a fee of
$1.1 million to its banking group as part of the amendment to the credit
agreement.
                                       27
<page>   20
 
     the ability of the company to "comply with the covenants in the credit
agreement," meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be
dependent upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which,
in turn, will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial,
business and other factors, including factors beyond the company's control. "the
operating results for the month of january 1998 were lower than management's
expectations due to the timing of the implementation of price increases and
product line rationalization. as a result, the company is uncertain whether its
operating performance for the first quarter of 1998 will be in full compliance
with covenants in its credit agreement. in the event the company does not meet
the covenants, the company will need to seek waiver from its banking group. a
portion of the consolidated debt of the company bears interest at floating
rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by
changes in prevailing interest rates. the company has entered into an interest
rate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.
 
     management believes that based on current levels of operations and
anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at december 31,
1997 of $4.9 million, will be adequate for 1998 to make required payments of
principal and interest on the company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated
capital expenditures of $13 million in 1998, and to meet working capital
requirements.
 
     the amount of debt available under the company's current credit agreement
decreases by $30.0 million in february 1999 and by an additional $50.0 million
in july 1999. based on the company's current level of operating results and the
expected operating results in 1998 and 1999, the company expects that the
reduction of $30.0 million in february 1999 will not have a significant effect
on its operations. however, the reduction in available borrowing of $50.0
million at the end of 1999 may require the company to explore other financing
alternatives, including but not limited to a refinancing of its bank debt,
raising new private or public debt, raising additional public equity capital,
reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating costs and selling
certain assets. in the event that the company is not able to successfully
complete the financing alternatives just described, the company and its banking
group would be required to negotiate revisions to the terms of the credit
agreement.
 
inflation
 
     the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 1997.
 
newly issued accounting standards
 
     during the fourth quarter of 1997, the company adopted statement of
financial accounting standards no. 128, earnings per share ("sfas 128"). such
adoption resulted in a new presentation of earnings per share amounts as either
"basic" or "diluted." basic earnings per share is calculated as net income
divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. diluted earnings
per share is calculated in a manner similar to the "primary" earnings per share
previously presented by the company. diluted earnings per share is calculated as
net income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, as
adjusted for common stock options. the company has restated its quarterly
earnings per share to present such information in accordance with the new
accounting standard.
 
     in february 1998, the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin no. 98 ("sab 98") which requires the company to present
historical earnings per share for pre-ipo periods even if such information,
historically, was not considered meaningful, in order to be consistent with sfas
128. however, in accordance with sab 98, changes in the company's capital
structure at the time of the initial public offering relative to preferred stock
and preferred stock options conversion to common stock and common stock options
are not presented retroactively. in addition, the number of common shares issued
during the company's initial public offering is not retroactively restated. the
weighted average common shares outstanding under the basic and diluted methods
described in the preceding paragraph reflect only common stock or common stock
options actually outstanding for the periods presented. the 8.1192-for-one
 
                                       28
<page>   21
 
common stock split by the company at the time of its initial public offering has
been retroactively restated for all periods presented.
 
     two new accounting standards, statement of financial accounting standards
no. 130, reporting comprehensive income, and no. 131, disclosures about segments
of an enterprise and related information, will take effect during the first
quarter of 1998. the company does not expect that the adoption of such new
accounting standards will have any significant effects on the company's reported
financial information.
 
computer systems and year 2000
 
     the company has reviewed its current hardware and software systems,
including existing interfaces with vendors and customers, and has determined
that arrival of the year 2000 will not require any significant changes or
modifications to the company's existing systems.

             responsibility for the consolidated financial reports
 
     company management is responsible for the preparation, accuracy and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements and other financial
information included in this annual report. this responsibility includes
preparing the statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and necessarily includes estimates that are based on management's
best judgments.
 
     to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of company financial data,
management maintains internal controls, which are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are executed as authorized, that they are accurately
recorded, and that assets are properly safeguarded. internal financial and
operations management monitors these controls. it is essential for all company
employees to conduct their business affairs in keeping with the highest ethical
standards as outlined in our code of conduct policy. careful selection of
employees, and appropriate divisions of responsibility, also help us to achieve
our control objectives.
 
     the financial statements have been audited by the company's independent
accountants, price waterhouse llp. their report is also shown on this page.
 
     the board of directors, acting through its audit committee composed
entirely of outside directors, oversees the adequacy of the company's control
environment. the audit committee meets periodically with representatives of
price waterhouse llp and internal financial management to review accounting,
control, auditing and financial reporting matters. the independent accountants
also have full and free access to meet privately with the audit committee.

                       report of independent accountants
 
to the board of directors and stockholders of
  american pad &amp; paper company
 
     in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) on page 31 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of american pad &amp; paper company and its subsidiaries at
december 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 1997, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. these financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

      (amounts in thousands, except for per share and percentage amounts)
 
1. organization, basis of presentation and business
 
  organization and basis of presentation
 
     american pad &amp; paper company (formerly ampad holding corporation and
referred to hereafter as the "company") was incorporated on june 2, 1992 as a
holding company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of ampad corporation
("ampad"), the surviving entity from the merger between ampad acquisition
corporation and ampad. the company had no operations through july 31, 1992.
 
     on october 3, 1995, the company agreed to acquire in a merger transaction
all of the outstanding stock of wr acquisition, inc. ("wr"). in a series of
transactions, the company exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly owned
subsidiary, ampad, for newly issued shares of wr. wr then contributed ampad to
its wholly owned subsidiary, williamhouse-regency of delaware, inc., renamed
american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. (referred to hereafter on a
pre-october 31, 1995 basis as "williamhouse-regency" and on a post-october 31,
1995 basis as "ap&amp;p; delaware"), in exchange for a right to receive $140 million
of merger consideration. the company, principally using bank borrowings by ap&amp;p;
delaware aggregating $245 million, funded wr's right to receive the merger
consideration. wr in turn repurchased 100% of the wr shares not owned by the
company. the company accounted for the transaction as a purchase of the stock of
wr. as a result of the transactions, the company now owns 100% of wr, which in
turn owns 100% of ap&amp;p; delaware.
 
     the financial statements of the company include the historical accounts and
operations of the company and ap&amp;p; delaware. included in the historical accounts
and operations of ap&amp;p; delaware are the accounts and operations of ampad, the
envelope operations of williamhouse and niagara, and the computer form
operations of shade/allied since their respective dates of acquisition.
additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
notepad funding corporation ("notepad"), a special purpose corporation utilized
in the accounts receivable facility. all significant intercompany balances have
been eliminated.
 
  american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc.
 
     the company's wholly owned subsidiary, ap&amp;p; delaware, is the issuer of 13%
senior subordinated notes ("notes"). terms of the notes require, among other
matters, that ap&amp;p; delaware provide annual audited and quarterly unaudited
financial statements to the holders of the publicly traded notes. the company is
providing the holders of the notes with its quarterly and annual consolidated
financial statements as well as its periodic reports as filed with the
securities and exchange commission. the company believes that providing such
consolidated financial statements satisfies the financial information and debt
compliance reporting needs of the holders of the notes.
 
     there are no material differences between the financial statements of the
company and of ap&amp;p; delaware. the composition of the ap&amp;p; delaware's
stockholders' equity at december 31, 1997 consists of one hundred shares of
$0.01 par value common stock, paid in capital of $202,357 and an accumulated
deficit of $101,691 and, in total, is equal to the stockholders' equity of the
company.
 
  business
 
     the company is among the larger manufacturers and marketers of paper-based
office products in north america. the company operates in one business segment,
converting paper into office products and offers a broad assortment of products
through two complementary divisions: ampad (writing pads, file folders, retail
envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based office products) and
williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). the company's products are
distributed through large mass merchant retailers, office product superstores,
warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office products wholesalers, paper
merchants, and independent dealers. substantially all sales are to customers
within the united states.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  pro forma information
 
     the pro forma information included in these financial statements and notes
is unaudited.
 
  quarterly financial information
 
     the quarterly financial information included in these financial statements
is unaudited and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial
position, its results of operations and its cash flows. operating results for
any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full
fiscal year.
 
2. summary of significant accounting policies
 
     significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
  use of estimates
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  cash and cash equivalents
 
     the company considers all highly liquid, interest-bearing instruments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
  revenue recognition
 
     the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. all risks and
rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. damaged or defective
products may be returned to the company for replacement or credit. the company
also offers sales volume rebates or contractual allowance payments to customers
based on their level of sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell
the company's products, which aggregate period shall not exceed three years. the
effects of returns, discounts and other incentives are estimated and recorded at
the time of shipment. volume rebates and allowances are estimated and recorded
based on sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell the company's
products.
 
  concentration of credit risk
 
     the company sells its products into various wholesale and retail channels,
primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. management believes
its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business
risks. the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and
does not require collateral. historically, the company has not experienced
significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any
particular industry or geographic area. an allowance is maintained at a level
that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses
including potential losses on receivables sold.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  inventories
 
     inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper products,
are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the last-in,
first-out (lifo) method. costs include material, labor and overhead.
 
  property and equipment
 
     property and equipment are recorded at cost. depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual
assets. significant repairs or betterments, which extend the useful life of an
asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
 
  goodwill and intangible assets
 
     goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired in purchase transactions. goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. intangible assets
represent trade names acquired in the wr and shade/allied acquisitions and are
amortized using the straight-line method. trade names in the aggregate gross
amount of $31,700 and $6,200 for wr and $5,610 for shade/allied, are amortized
over 40, 15 and 40 years, respectively. amortization expense was $879 in 1995,
$4,488 in 1996 and $6,110 in 1997.
 
  long-lived assets
 
     it is the company's policy to periodically review the net realizable value
of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, through an
assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. in the
event that assets are found to be carried at amounts which are in excess of
estimated gross future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the
underlying assets. based upon its most recent analysis, the company does not
believe an impairment of long-lived assets exists at december 31, 1997.
 
  debt issuance costs
 
     costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.
 
  income taxes
 
     the company accounts for income taxes following the liability method, which
prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in the company's financial statements or tax returns.
deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for
deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. the company periodically reviews the realizability
of its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.
 
  derivatives
 
     premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as interest
expense over the term of the agreement. amounts receivable under the interest
rate cap agreement are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  fair value of financial instruments
 
     carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. the carrying value of senior bank debt bearing interest at
floating rates approximates fair value. the carrying value at december 31, 1997
of the notes of $130,000 compares to the notes' fair value of $140,400 based on
quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1997.
 
  earnings per share
 
     basic earnings per share is computed as the quotient of net income (loss)
divided by the weighted average actual number of outstanding shares of common
stock at the end of a year. diluted earnings per share is computed as the
quotient of net income (loss) divided by the number of outstanding shares of
common stock as adjusted for common stock options. the difference between basic
and diluted weighted average shares is due to 1,018 dilutive common stock
options granted through 1996. the adjustment for common stock options is
calculated by assuming that all dilutive options are exercised, that the
proceeds from such exercise are used to repurchase shares of the company's stock
at the average price of the common stock during the period and the company will
also generate proceeds and repurchase shares from the tax benefits associated
with the assumed exercise of the common stock options. options to purchase 50
shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $20.94 per share
were outstanding during the second half of 1996 but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of these
options was greater than the average market price of the common stock. dilutive
earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding are not presented in
1995 and 1997 due to the losses incurred and the anti-dilutive effect of the
common stock options. in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards no. 128, earnings per share, all periods presented in the financial
statements have been restated to adopt this new earnings per share presentation.
 
     in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting
bulletin no. 98, the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and
common stock options is calculated based on the historical timing of the common
stock transactions. the historical numbers do not reflect retroactive treatment
of the company's initial public offering of common stock or the conversion of
preferred stock and preferred stock options; however, the company's
8.1192 -- for -- one stock split in 1996 has been retroactively reflected in the
company's financial statements.

  pro forma results of operations
 
     the following summary for the year ended december 31, 1996 presents the
results of operations on a pro forma basis, as if the niagara and shade/allied
acquisitions had occurred as of january 1, 1996 (with appropriate adjustments
for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, elimination of
duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related income tax
effects). the summary for the year ended december 31, 1995 presents the results
of operations as if the niagara, wr and globe acquisitions had occurred as of
january 1, 1995 (with appropriate adjustments for amortization of intangible
assets, interest expense, elimination of duplicate selling and administrative
expenses and the related income tax effects). as shade/allied was acquired
effective february 11, 1997, the pro forma results for the year ended december
31, 1997 are not materially different from the actual results and therefore are
not reported here. the pro forma operating results are for illustrative purposes
only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results

     the company originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a revolving
pool of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in october 1995. on may 24, 1996,
the company entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with similar
terms. at december 31, 1996 and 1997, $54,000 and $60,000 of accounts receivable
were sold respectively under this facility. the accompanying balance sheets
exclude the sold accounts receivable. the full amount of the allowance for
doubtful accounts has been retained because the company has retained
substantially the same risk of credit loss as if the receivables had not been
sold through the recourse provision of the receivable sale agreement. under the
agreement, the maximum amount of the purchaser's investment is subject to change
based on the level of eligible receivables and restrictions on concentrations of
receivables. the total cost of the program was $423 in 1995, $1,823 in 1996 and
$2,954 in 1997. the agreement expires in 2000.

inventories for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,845 to fair
market value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical lifo reserves.

historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.

  senior bank debt
 
     contemporaneously with the company's initial public offering of common
stock, the company refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the
old bank credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. the new
bank credit agreement, as amended, is a revolving credit facility with a maximum
availability of $330,000 with the following principal terms. loans are made
directly to ap&amp;p; delaware and are guaranteed by the company and each of its
subsidiaries, other than notepad. loans made under the new bank credit agreement
bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to, at the company's option, the base
rate, plus an applicable margin, or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin,
as such terms are defined in the agreement and amendments. the applicable margin
for base rate loans varies from .5% to 1.5% and the applicable margin for
eurodollar rate loans varies from 1.5% to 2.5%, each based on the company's
leverage ratio and the type of loan. availability under the new bank credit
agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is a percentage of the
unutilized revolving loan commitment. the percentage varies from .3% to .5%
based on the company's leverage ratio.
 
     availability under the new bank credit agreement as amended is reduced to
the extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by the company, the net
proceeds of an issuance of debt by the company or 50% of the net proceeds of an
issuance of equity by the company. availability will be reduced by $80,000 in
1999 and $50,000 in 2000. the new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
     the new bank credit agreement and amendments require the company to meet
certain financial tests, including minimum levels of ebitda (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in
the agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. the
agreement also contains covenants, which, among other things, limit the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. in addition no dividends may be paid prior to march 31, 1999, the
company will not incur capital expenditures during 1998 in excess of $15,000 and
future acquisitions require the written consent of the banks. the new bank
credit agreement contains customary events of default, including payment
defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults,
cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and
insolvency, erisa, judgment defaults, failure of any guaranty or security
agreement supporting the bank credit agreement to be in full force and effect,
and change of control.
 
     the new bank credit agreement requires the company to continue its interest
rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the old bank credit
agreement. in january 1996, the company entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles the company to receive from the counterpart on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which libor exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. the counterpart to this agreement is a large financial institution.
 
     the new bank credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and all its
subsidiaries, except for notepad, and is secured by substantially all the assets
of ap&amp;p; delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of ap&amp;p; delaware and its
subsidiaries.
 
  senior subordinated notes
 
     ap&amp;p; delaware issued $200,000 of 13% senior subordinated notes ("notes")
through a private placement in december 1995. in june 1996, ap&amp;p; delaware
completed an exchange of the privately held notes for publicly held notes with
substantially identical terms. the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all
senior bank debt. interest is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15.
the notes are redeemable on and after november 15, 2000, at ap&amp;p; delaware's
option, at redemption prices ranging from 106.5% of the face value of the notes
in 2000 to 100% of the face value of the notes in 2003 or thereafter.
additionally, at any time on or prior to november 15, 1998, ap&amp;p; delaware may,
at its option, use the proceeds of public equity offerings of the company or
ap&amp;p; delaware to redeem up to 35% of the notes at redemption prices ranging from
111% to 113% of the face value of the notes. subsequent to the company's initial
public offering of common stock in july 1996, ap&amp;p; delaware repaid $70,000 of
the notes.
 
     the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all subsidiaries of
ap&amp;p; delaware, except for notepad, on a joint, several and senior subordinated
basis, however, no guarantee from the company exists. the notes contain
restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit dividends, repurchase of
capital stock and investments, incurrence of additional indebtedness,
transactions with affiliates and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements.
 
     on december 1, 1995, $200,000 of proceeds were received from the notes and
were used to repurchase $100,000 of publicly-held notes of williamhouse-regency
assumed in the wr acquisition and redeem preferred stock, preferred stock
equivalents, and class p common stock in the aggregate amount of $75,000.

payment of principal and interest on the industrial revenue bonds. letters of
credit secure the industrial revenue bonds.
 
     at december 31, 1996 and 1997, letters of credit in the aggregate amount of
$15,826 and $12,996, respectively, were outstanding.
 
     the company incurred fees related to financing transactions of
approximately $8,620 in 1996 which have been deferred and are being amortized
using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the agreements.
 
     an extraordinary after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,995
($33,004 pre-tax) is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended december 31, 1996 as a result of $7,700 of prepayment penalties
associated with the repayment of $70,000 of notes and the write off of $25,304
of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with such notes and with
the company's old bank credit agreement. an extraordinary after-tax loss on
extinguishment of debt of $9,652 ($16,086 pretax) is reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 1995 as a
result of $10,812 of prepayment penalties associated with the repurchase of
williamhouse-regency's $100,000 of notes and ampad's bank debt and the write-off
of $5,274 of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with
williamhouse-regency's notes redemption and ampad's debt refinancings.
 
10. stockholders' equity, stock options and nonrecurring compensation charge
 
     effective july 2, 1996, the company sold 12,500 shares of common stock in
an initial public offering. the net proceeds to the company from the offering,
which were received on july 8, 1996, amounted to $172,801 after deducting
underwriting discounts, legal and accounting fees, registration and travel
expenses. the company used proceeds from the initial public offering and working
capital to: (i) repay $95,800 on the indebtedness incurred under the old bank
credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the 13% notes from the
holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in redemption premium
on such notes.
 
     prior to the completion of the initial public offering, the company's
shareholders approved an 8.1192-for-one stock split for all of the then
outstanding common stock shares and common stock options. concurrently with the
stock split, all of the outstanding preferred stock and preferred stock options
were converted into shares of common stock and common stock options,
respectively, using a conversion price determined by dividing the preferred
stock liquidation value of $1,948.50 per share by the initial public offering
price per share of $15. all common stock share amounts have been restated to
reflect the stock split; however, the common stock share amounts have not been
restated to reflect the conversion of preferred stock and preferred stock
options.
 
     the preferred stock has no dividend rights and, except as required by law,
is nonvoting. as of december 31, 1995, after giving effect to satisfaction of
its preferred redemption values, the company's class p common stock was also
converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock.
 
     at january 1, 1995, options for 1,026 shares of common stock had been
issued to certain members of the company's management under the 1992 key
employee stock option plan (the "1992 plan") in two separate tranches -- "core"
stock options for 758 shares and "performance" stock options for 268 shares. the
exercise price of all options equaled or exceeded the fair market value at date
of grant. in connection with the wr acquisition effective october 31, 1995, the
company's equity was recapitalized via a stock dividend of one share of
preferred stock for every ten shares of common stock and class p common stock
and options to purchase common stock. concurrently, preferred stock options were
granted to holders of common stock options and the respective exercise prices
were adjusted to maintain option holders' pro rata economic interests pursuant
to antidilution provisions included in the existing stock option plans.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
     the issuance of the preferred stock options was considered additional
consideration to restore the option holders' economic position as a result of
the recapitalization, which was directly related to the wr acquisition. receipt
of such consideration resulted in a nonrecurring, noncash compensation charge
equal to the excess of fair market value over the exercise price of the
preferred stock options of $24,265 with a corresponding credit being recorded to
additional paid-in capital. the adjustment to the underlying common stock
option's prices did not result in additional compensation expense in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     additionally, options for 66 shares of common stock and 105 shares of
preferred stock were granted to certain members of management in december 1995.
the exercise prices of $0.007 per common share and $.028 per preferred share
were below the fair market value of the respective classes of stock at date of
grant, resulting in a noncash compensation charge equal to the aggregate excess
of fair market value over the exercise price, or $1,733, with a corresponding
credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.
 
     the company awarded additional compensation to executives and nonexecutives
of $1,634 in 1995 in recognition of the significant transactions consummated
during the year. the company does not expect this additional compensation to be
awarded in future years.
 
stock options
 
     1992 key employees stock option plan. on july 31, 1992, the board of
directors of the company adopted the ampad holding corporation 1992 key
employees stock option plan, which authorized grants of stock options and the
sale of common stock to current or future employees, directors, consultants or
advisers of the company or its subsidiaries. during 1992, 1994 and 1995, the
company granted options to purchase 2,839 shares of common stock to three of its
officers, who were also stockholders, at weighted average purchase prices
ranging from $.007 to $1.65 per share. currently, all options granted pursuant
to the 1992 stock plan are exercisable and expire 15 months after the
termination of the option holder's employment with the company or any of its
subsidiaries. on june 22, 1996 the board of directors terminated the 1992 stock
plan.
 
     1996 stock plan. on june 22, 1996, the company adopted the 1996 key
employees stock incentive plan. the 1996 stock plan provides for the granting to
employees and other key individuals who perform services for the company the
following types of incentive awards: options to purchase common stock, stock
appreciation rights with respect to the common stock, restricted shares of
common stock, performance grants and other types of awards that the compensation
committee deems to be consistent with the purposes of the 1996 stock plan. the
1996 stock plan affords the company flexibility in tailoring incentive
compensation to support corporate and business objectives, and to anticipate and
respond to changing business environments and competitive compensation
practices.
 
     an aggregate of 1,500 shares of common stock of the company has been
reserved for issuance under the 1996 stock plan. except for any other
adjustments made by the board of directors relating to a stock split or certain
other changes in the number of shares of common stock, or to reflect
extraordinary corporate transactions, further increases in the number of shares
authorized for issuance under the 1996 stock plan must be approved by the
stockholders of the company. stock options granted during 1996 under the stock
plan generally have a maximum term of ten years and vest over four years. the
company granted options to purchase 742 shares of common stock at a weighted
average purchase price of $15 per share.
 
     non-employee director plan. on june 22, 1996, the company adopted the
non-employee director stock option plan. pursuant to the non-employee director
plan, each director (other than directors who are employees of the company) will
receive a one-time option grant to purchase 25 shares of common stock upon
effectiveness of the non-employee director plan or, for new directors, upon
initial election or appointment to the board. in addition, each director will
receive an annual grant of options to purchase 2 shares of common stock
beginning on the latter of the date of such director's fourth anniversary of
being elected to the board or four years from the initial public offering date.
the initial one-time grants will vest over three years with 50%

vesting in the first year and 25% in the remaining two years. the annual grants
will vest in three equal installments. the exercise price for all options
granted under the non-employee director plan will be at fair market value as of
the time of such grant. options granted under the non-employee director plan
would generally terminate ten years after the date such options become
exercisable. an aggregate of 350 shares of common stock has been reserved for
issuance under the non-employee director plan. during 1996, the company granted
options to purchase 125 shares of common stock to the company's non-employee
directors at a weighted average purchase price of $17.38 per share.
 
     stock purchase plan. on june 22, 1996, the company adopted the management
stock purchase plan (the "purchase plan"). the purchase plan is designed to
provide equity incentives to selected members of the company's management,
including employee directors and executive officers. the compensation committee
upon the recommendation of the company's chief executive officer will select the
eligible participants. under the purchase plan, eligible participants will be
able to elect to purchase shares of common stock in lieu of up to 25% of their
annual incentive bonuses. the common stock will be sold under the purchase plan
at a 25% discount from the fair market value on the date of purchase. an
aggregate of 250 shares of common stock has been reserved and 36 shares were
issued in february 1997.
 
     for the three years ended december 31, 1997, stock option activity is as

     the effect on the income tax provision related to the valuation allowance
was a benefit of $1,769 for the year ended december 31, 1995. deferred tax
assets valuation allowances recorded in prior years were reversed in 1995 as a
result of management's assessment of future realizability of deferred tax
assets.
 
     at december 31, 1997, the company had net operating losses available to
reduce future taxable income of approximately $30,900. these net operating
losses expire in the years 2007 through 2012. if certain substantial changes in
the company's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the
amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized. in addition, the company has
approximately $1,406 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. the
acquisition of wr resulted in a change in control of wr. consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.
 
13. commitments and contingencies
 
  commitments
 
     the company is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for office
space and machinery and equipment, which expire at various times through 2016.
annual minimum lease commitments under these leases amount to $5,886 in 1998,
$5,007 in 1999, $3,813 in 2000, $3,249 in 2001, $2,911 in 2002 and $25,853
thereafter for an aggregate of $46,719.
 
     total rent expense was approximately $1,888, $3,551, $6,572 for 1995, 1996
and 1997 respectively.
 
  litigation
 
     on march 10, 1998, the company, certain of its officers and directors,
certain former controlling stockholders and certain investment banking firms
that participated in the company's ipo were named in a civil action filed in the
united states district court in the northern district of texas, dallas division.
the complaint, a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of the company's
common stock between july 2, 1996 and december 17, 1997, alleges violation of
the federal securities laws for failure to disclose certain facts about the
company's operations in connection with the company's ipo and in certain
periodic reports. the complaint seeks unspecified damages and any other relief
permitted by law. the company believes that the allegations in the complaint are
without merit, and the company intends to rigorously defend itself.

federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of
1980, as amended, at five waste disposal sites. the company settled its
liability at four of these sites as a de minimis party. the company expects to

was included in deferred financing fees and $2,700 was a direct acquisition
expense allocated to the net assets acquired. the company also paid $450 to bain
capital relating to the globe-weis acquisition, which was included in deferred

     the company had an outstanding note receivable of $324 and $270 at december

in 2000.
 
     on january 9, 1998, the company's interim chief financial officer, who is
also a director, exercised stock options to purchase 288 shares for $10. in
december 1997, the company's board of directors approved a loan for up to $1.0

6.25%, fully secured by the 288 shares of common stock. this individual intends
to draw on this note by the end of march 1998. in january 1998, the company's

                       report of independent accountants
 
to the board of directors and stockholder of
  american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc.
     (a wholly owned subsidiary of american pad &amp; paper company)
 
     in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) on page 31 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. and its
subsidiaries at december 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. these
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

  organization and basis of presentation
 
     american pad &amp; paper co. of delaware, inc. ("delaware") is a wholly owned
subsidiary of american pad &amp; paper company ( "ap&amp;p;") (formerly ampad holding
corporation and referred to hereafter as the "company"). ap&amp;p; was incorporated
on june 2, 1992 as a holding company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of
ampad corporation ("ampad"), the surviving entity from the merger between ampad
acquisition corporation and ampad. the company had no operations through july
31, 1992.
 
     on october 3, 1995, the company agreed to acquire in a merger transaction
all of the outstanding stock of wr acquisition, inc. ("wr"). in a series of
transactions, the company exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly owned
subsidiary, ampad, for newly issued shares of wr. wr then contributed ampad to
its wholly owned subsidiary, williamhouse-regency of delaware, inc., renamed
american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. (referred to hereafter on a
pre-october 31, 1995 basis as "williamhouse-regency" and on a post-october 31,
1995 basis as "delaware"), in exchange for a right to receive $140 million of
merger consideration. the company, principally using bank borrowings by delaware
aggregating $245 million, funded wr's right to receive the merger consideration.
wr in turn repurchased 100% of the wr shares not owned by the company. the
company accounted for the transaction as a purchase of the stock of wr. as a

     the quarterly financial information included in these financial statements
is unaudited and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring

2. summary of significant accounting policies
 
     significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
  use of estimates
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  cash and cash equivalents
 
     delaware considers all highly liquid, interest-bearing instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
  revenue recognition
 
     delaware recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. all risks and
rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. damaged or defective
products may be returned to delaware for replacement or credit. delaware also
offers sales volume rebates or contractual allowance payments to customers based
on their level of sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell
delaware's products, which aggregate period shall not exceed three years. the
effects of returns, discounts and other incentives are estimated and recorded at
the time of shipment. volume rebates and allowances are estimated and recorded
based on sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell delaware's
products.
 
  concentration of credit risk
 
     delaware sells its products into various wholesale and retail channels,
primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. management believes
its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business
risks. delaware performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and does
not require collateral. historically, delaware has not experienced significant
losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular
industry or geographic area. an allowance is maintained at a level that
management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses including
potential losses on receivables sold.
 
  inventories
 
     inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper products,
are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the last-in,
first-out (lifo) method. costs include material, labor and overhead.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  property and equipment
 
     property and equipment are recorded at cost. depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual
assets. significant repairs or betterments, which extend the useful life of an
asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
 
  goodwill and intangible assets
 
     goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired in purchase transactions. goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. intangible assets
represent trade names acquired in the wr and shade/allied acquisitions and are
amortized using the straight-line method. trade names in the aggregate gross
amount of $31,700 and $6,200 for wr and $5,610 for shade/allied, are amortized
over 40, 15 and 40 years, respectively. amortization expense was $879 in 1995,
$4,488 in 1996 and $6,110 in 1997.
 
  long-lived assets
 
     it is delaware's policy to periodically review the net realizable value of
its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, through an
assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. in the
event that assets are found to be carried at amounts which are in excess of
estimated gross future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the
underlying assets. based upon its most recent analysis, delaware does not
believe an impairment of long-lived assets exists at december 31, 1997.
 
  debt issuance costs
 
     costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.
 
  income taxes
 
     delaware accounts for income taxes following the liability method, which
prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in delaware's financial statements or tax returns.
deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for
deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. delaware periodically reviews the realizability of
its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.
 
  derivatives
 
     premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as interest
expense over the term of the agreement. amounts receivable under the interest
rate cap agreement are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.
 
  fair value of financial instruments
 
     carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. the carrying value of senior bank debt bearing interest at
floating rates approximates fair value. the carrying value at december 31, 1997
of the notes of $130,000 compares to the notes' fair value of $140,400 based on
quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1997.

  reclassifications
 
     certain amounts in the 1995 and 1996 consolidated financial statements,
none of which have an effect on net income (loss), have been reclassified to
conform to the presentation in the 1997 consolidated financial statements.
 
3. acquisitions
 
  shade/allied, inc.
 
     effective february 11, 1997, delaware acquired all of the outstanding

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
$147,853 and consisted of cash of $140,000 and direct acquisition costs of
$7,853. the acquisition was entirely financed through the company's bank credit
agreement and an off-balance sheet accounts receivable facility. the aggregate
acquisition costs have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed as follows: accounts receivable of $39,174; inventories of $49,496;
prepaid expenses and other assets of $8,699; net assets held for sale of
$41,179; property and equipment of $81,682; identifiable intangible assets of

and the personalizing division, which provides custom imprinting services.
 
     the personalizing stationery and invitations division acquired in the
acquisition was identified by management at the date of acquisition as a
nonstrategic asset held for sale. the purchase price allocated to the net assets
acquired included the expected proceeds from sale plus the net cash flows
expected to be generated from the personalizing division from the date of
acquisition through the expected date of sale (the holding period), offset by
interest expense incurred during the holding period on debt incurred to finance
the purchase of the personalizing division. on june 27, 1996, the personalizing
division was sold for net proceeds of $47,890. the net proceeds from the sale
exceeded the carrying amount of the asset held for sale by $1,599. as such, the
preliminary purchase price allocation was adjusted resulting in a $959 addition
to goodwill. during the six month period ended june 30, 1996, the personalizing
division had operating income of $2,369 and interest carrying costs of $1,884,
which have been excluded from the condensed consolidated statement of operations
and included as adjustments to the carrying amount of the net assets held for
sale through the date of sale.
 
  globe-weis
 
     effective august 16, 1995, delaware acquired the inventories and certain
equipment of the file folder and hanging file folder product lines of
globe-weis's ("globe") office products division from globe's parent. for
financial reporting purposes, this acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was
allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net assets.
the aggregate acquisition costs totaled $19,958 and consisted of cash and seller
issued notes of $17,869 and direct acquisition and financing costs of $2,089.
delaware principally financed the acquisition through its financing arrangement
with a commercial lender and notes issued to the seller. the allocation of the
aggregate acquisition costs was as follows: inventories of $11,546, equipment of
$6,747, and debt issuance costs of $1,665. the operating results of this
acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition.
 
  strategic assimilation of acquisitions
 
     certain costs are expected to be incurred in connection with delaware's
separate strategic plans to integrate and consolidate certain plant,
administrative, sales and corporate functions of williamhouse, niagara and
shade/allied and the associated net reduction of approximately 500 employees.
such costs, aggregating $27,500, include lease termination expenses, severance
and contractual change of control benefits, the liabilities that were included
in the purchase price allocation within accrued expenses. the remaining $8,534
in accrued acquisition integration costs is intended to cover the costs of
closing and integrating six manufacturing facilities and one distribution
facility which are expected to be completed during the next two to three years.

  pro forma results of operations
 
     the following summary for the year ended december 31, 1996 presents the
results of operations on a pro forma basis, as if the niagara and shade/allied
acquisitions had occurred as of january 1, 1996 (with appropriate adjustments
for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, elimination of
duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related income tax
effects). the summary for the year ended december 31, 1995 presents the results
of operations as if the niagara, wr and globe acquisitions had occurred as of
january 1, 1995 (with appropriate adjustments for amortization of intangible
assets, interest expense, elimination of duplicate selling and administrative
expenses and the related income tax effects). as shade/allied was acquired
effective february 11, 1997, the pro forma results for the year ended december
31, 1997 are not materially different from the actual results and therefore are
not reported here. the pro forma operating results are for illustrative purposes
only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results which would have
occurred had the transaction been consummated as of those earlier dates, nor are
they indicative of results of operations which may occur in the future.

     delaware originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a revolving
pool of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in october 1995. on may 24, 1996,
delaware entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with similar
terms. at december 31, 1996 and 1997, $54,000 and $60,000 of accounts receivable
were sold respectively under this facility. the accompanying balance sheets
exclude the sold accounts receivable. the full amount of the allowance for
doubtful accounts has been retained because delaware has retained substantially
the same risk of credit loss as if the receivables had not been sold through the
recourse provision of the receivable sale agreement. under the agreement, the
maximum amount of the purchaser's investment is subject to change based on the
level of eligible receivables and restrictions on concentrations of receivables.
the total cost of the program was $423 in 1995, $1,823 in 1996 and $2,954 in
1997. the agreement expires in 2000.
 
     bad debt expense for 1995, 1996 and 1997 was immaterial.

     in connection with the wr, niagara, and shade/allied acquisitions, total
inventories for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,845 to fair
market value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical lifo reserves.
since delaware is on the lifo method of accounting, such write-up formed the
historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.
there were no liquidations of lifo inventories in 1997. liquidation of lifo

  senior bank debt
 
     contemporaneously with the company's initial public offering of common
stock, delaware refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the old
bank credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. the new bank
credit agreement, as amended, is a revolving credit facility with a maximum
availability of $330,000 with the following principal terms. loans are made
directly to delaware and are guaranteed by the company and each of its
subsidiaries, other than notepad. loans made under the new bank

credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to, at delaware's
option, the base rate, plus an applicable margin, or a eurodollar rate plus an
applicable margin, as such terms are defined in the agreement and amendments.
the applicable margin for base rate loans varies from .5% to 1.5% and the
applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans varies from 1.5% to 2.5%, each based
on delaware's leverage ratio and the type of loan. availability under the new
bank credit agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is a
percentage of the unutilized revolving loan commitment. the percentage varies
from .3% to .5% based on delaware's leverage ratio.
 
     availability under the new bank credit agreement as amended is reduced to
the extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by delaware, the net proceeds
of an issuance of debt by delaware or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance of
equity by the company or delaware. availability will be reduced by $80,000 in
1999 and $50,000 in 2000. the new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001.
 
     the new bank credit agreement and amendments require delaware to meet
certain financial tests, including minimum levels of ebitda (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in
the agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. the
agreement also contains covenants, which, among other things, limit the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. in addition no dividends may be paid prior to march 31, 1999,
delaware will not incur capital expenditures during 1998 in excess of $15,000
and future acquisitions require the written consent of the banks. the new bank
credit agreement contains customary events of default, including payment
defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults,
cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and
insolvency, erisa, judgment defaults, failure of any guaranty or security
agreement supporting the bank credit agreement to be in full force and effect,
and change of control.
 
     the new bank credit agreement requires delaware to continue its interest
rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the old bank credit
agreement. in january 1996, delaware entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles delaware to receive from the counterpart on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which libor exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. the counterpart to this agreement is a large financial institution.
 
     the new bank credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and all its
subsidiaries, except for notepad, and is secured by substantially all the assets
of delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of delaware and its subsidiaries.
 
  senior subordinated notes
 
     delaware issued $200,000 of 13% senior subordinated notes ("notes") through
a private placement in december 1995. in june 1996, delaware completed an
exchange of the privately held notes for publicly held notes with substantially
identical terms. the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all senior bank
debt. interest is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15. the notes are
redeemable on and after november 15, 2000, at delaware's option, at redemption
prices ranging from 106.5% of the face value of the notes in 2000 to 100% of the
face value of the notes in 2003 or thereafter. additionally, at any time on or
prior to november 15, 1998, delaware may, at its option, use the proceeds of
public equity offerings of the company or delaware to redeem up to 35% of the
notes at redemption prices ranging from 111% to 113% of the face value of the
notes. subsequent to the company's initial public offering of common stock in
july 1996, delaware repaid $70,000 of the notes.
 
     the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all subsidiaries of
delaware, except for notepad, on a joint, several and senior subordinated basis,
however, no guarantee from the company exists. the notes contain restrictive
covenants which, among other things, limit dividends, repurchase of capital
stock and

investments, incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates
and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.
 
     on december 1, 1995, $200,000 of proceeds were received from the notes and
were used to repurchase $100,000 of publicly-held notes of williamhouse-regency
assumed in the wr acquisition and redeem preferred stock, preferred stock
equivalents, and class p common stock in the aggregate amount of $75,000.

     at december 31, 1997, delaware had outstanding various industrial revenue
bonds in the aggregate amount of $8,340. the industrial revenue bonds bear
interest at rates ranging from 3.2% to 4.8%. aggregate annual principal payments
ranging from $345 to $1,175 are due through 2010. delaware guarantees payment of
principal and interest on the industrial revenue bonds. letters of credit secure
the industrial revenue bonds.
 
     at december 31, 1996 and 1997, letters of credit in the aggregate amount of
$15,826 and $12,996, respectively, were outstanding.
 
     delaware incurred fees related to financing transactions of approximately
$8,620 in 1996 which have been deferred and are being amortized using the
effective interest method over the respective lives of the agreements.
 
     an extraordinary after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,995
($33,004 pre-tax) is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended december 31, 1996 as a result of $7,700 of prepayment penalties
associated with the repayment of $70,000 of notes and the write off of $25,304
of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with such notes and with
the company's old bank credit agreement. an extraordinary after-tax loss on
extinguishment of debt of $9,652 ($16,086 pretax) is reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 1995 as a
result of $10,812 of prepayment penalties associated with the repurchase of
williamhouse-regency's $100,000 of notes and ampad's bank debt and the write-off
of $5,274 of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with
williamhouse-regency's notes redemption and ampad's debt refinancings.
 
10. stockholder's equity, capital contribution and nonrecurring compensation
charge
 
     effective july 2, 1996, the company sold 12,500 shares of common stock in
an initial public offering. the net proceeds to the company from the offering,
which were received on july 8, 1996 and contributed to delaware, amounted to
$172,801 after deducting underwriting discounts, legal and accounting fees,
registration and travel expenses. delaware used proceeds from the initial public
offering and working capital to: (i) repay $95,800 on the indebtedness incurred
under the old bank credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the
13% notes from the holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in
redemption premium on such notes.
 
     at january 1, 1995, the company issued preferred stock options to
management and such issuance was considered additional consideration to the
option holders, which was directly related to the wr acquisition. delaware
recorded a nonrecurring, noncash compensation charge equal to the excess of fair
market value over the exercise price of the preferred stock options of $24,265
with a corresponding credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.
additionally, options for 66 shares of common stock of the company and 105
shares of preferred stock of the company were granted to certain members of
management in december 1995. the exercise prices of each common share and each
preferred share were below the fair market value of the respective classes of
stock at date of grant, resulting in a noncash compensation charge equal to the
aggregate excess of fair market value over the exercise price, or $1,733, with a
corresponding credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.

     delaware awarded additional compensation to executives and nonexecutives of
$1,634 in 1995 in recognition of the significant transactions consummated during
the year. delaware does not expect this additional compensation to be awarded in
future years.
 
11. pension plan and 401(k) plan
 
     delaware is a sponsor of two qualified defined benefit pension plans and a
supplemental non-qualified benefit pension plan, which were assumed as part of
its acquisitions. delaware's liabilities under such plans are included in other
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
 
     delaware maintains retirement plans (401(k) plans) for the benefit of all
employees who meet minimum age and service requirements. delaware contributions
to the plans may be made at the discretion of the board of directors.
contributions to the plans were approximately $568, $1,239, and $1,225 for the

     the effect on the income tax provision related to the valuation allowance
was a benefit of $1,769 for the year ended december 31, 1995. deferred tax
assets valuation allowances recorded in prior years were reversed in 1995 as a
result of management's assessment of future realizability of deferred tax
assets.
 
     at december 31, 1997, delaware had net operating losses available to reduce
future taxable income of approximately $30,900. these net operating losses
expire in the years 2007 through 2012. if certain substantial changes in
delaware's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the
amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized. in addition, delaware has
approximately $1,406 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. the
acquisition of wr resulted in a change in control of wr. consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.
 
13. commitments and contingencies
 
  commitments
 
     delaware is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for office space
and machinery and equipment, which expire at various times through 1998. annual
minimum lease commitments under these leases amount to $5,702 in 1998, $4,799 in
1999, $3,855 in 2000, $3,228 in 2001, $2,911 in 2002 and $25,853 thereafter for
an aggregate of $46,719.
 
     total rent expense was approximately $1,888, $3,551, $6,572 for 1995, 1996
and 1997 respectively.
 
  litigation
 
     on march 10, 1998, the company, certain of its officers and directors,
certain former controlling stockholders and certain investment banking firms
that participated in the company's ipo were named in a civil action filed in the
united states district court in the northern district of texas, dallas division.
the complaint, a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of the company's
common stock between july 2, 1996 and december 17, 1997, alleges violation of
the federal securities laws for failure to disclose certain facts about the
company's operations in connection with the company's ipo and in certain
periodic reports. the

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
complaint seeks unspecified damages and any other relief permitted by law. the
company believes that the allegations in the complaint are without merit, and
the company intends to rigorously defend itself.
 
     there are various other outstanding claims against delaware arising in the
normal course of business. delaware believes that the claims are without merit
and that any losses which might ultimately be sustained by delaware would not be
material to the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of
delaware.
 
  environmental matters
 
     delaware is subject to federal, state, and local environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations. such laws and regulations
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for
management of waste. while there can be no assurance that delaware is at all
times in complete compliance with all such requirements, delaware has made and
will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements.
 
     delaware had been named a potentially responsible party under the federal
comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, as
amended, at five waste disposal sites. delaware settled its liability at four of
these sites as a de minimis party. delaware expects to be eligible for a de
minimis settlement at the remaining site.
 
14. related party transactions
 
     for the years ended december 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, delaware expensed
$542, $1,380 and $2,371, respectively, for management and directors' fees and
out of pocket expenses to the principal shareholders (bain capital). unpaid fees
of $500 and $553 are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance
sheets at december 31, 1996 and 1997 respectively. in june 1996, the company and
delaware revised their management services agreement with bain capital, pursuant
to which, for four years, delaware will pay bain capital an aggregate annual fee
of no less than $2,000 plus a fee of 1% for completed acquisition transactions.
 
     in 1996, delaware paid bain capital $3,000 in fees in connection with the
new bank credit agreement, which were included in debt issuance costs paid, $550
and $750, respectively, in fees in connection with the acquisition of niagara
and shade/allied, which were included as part of the purchase price, and $2,091
in connection with the company's initial public offering of common stock. in
1995, delaware paid $7,000 to bain capital for services relating to the wr
acquisition and the related financing of the transaction. of this amount, $4,300
was included in deferred financing fees and $2,700 was a direct acquisition
expense allocated to the net assets acquired. the company also paid $450 to bain
capital relating to the globe-weis acquisition, which was included in deferred
financing fees.
 
     the company had an outstanding note receivable of $324 and $270 at december
31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. from its executive vice president which is due
in 2000.
 
     on january 9, 1998, the company's interim chief financial officer, who is
also a director, exercised stock options to purchase 288 shares for $10. in
december 1997, the company's board of directors approved a loan for up to $1.0
million for the same individual due in three years at a rate of approximately
6.25%, fully secured by the 288 shares of common stock. this individual intends
to draw on this note by the end of march 1998. in january 1998, the company's
board of directors approved an extension of 18 months to exercise 299 common
stock options after this individual is no longer a director for the company.
 
15. other information
 
     substantially all of delaware's operations are conducted within the united
states.
 
     two customers accounted for 27% of delaware's net sales for 1995 and one

17. condensed consolidating financial information of guarantor subsidiary
 
     the 13% senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by shade/allied, inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of delaware. the subsidiary guaranty is full,
unconditional and joint and several. delaware is not a guarantor of the senior
subordinated notes. separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiary

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations
 
overview
 
     the company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of nationally
branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in
the $60 billion to $70 billion north american office products industry. the
company offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file
folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products. through its
ampad division, the company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other
paper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers and retail
envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office products
distributors. through its williamhouse division, the company is the leading
supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes to paper
merchants and distributors. the company believes that its future operating
results will not be directly comparable to its historical operating results
because of its strategic acquisitions. the company's business has not generally
been seasonal in nature. certain factors which have affected, and may affect
prospectively, the operating results of the company are discussed below.
 
     strategic acquisitions. on october 31, 1995, the company acquired
williamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and fastest
growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumption of
debt) of approximately $300.7 million plus reimbursement of certain expenses to
the sellers. on june 28, 1996, the company acquired niagara, a national supplier
of envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $53.2 million, including costs of the acquisition and a $5 million
one year consulting agreement with niagara's former president. with these
acquisitions, the company became the largest supplier of envelopes to the
national paper merchants. the williamhouse acquisition was financed through the
company's old bank credit agreement and the assumption of senior subordinated
notes. the niagara acquisition was financed with proceeds from the sale of the
personalizing division of williamhouse.
 
     on february 11, 1997, the company acquired shade/allied, a national
supplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. the purchase
price of $50.7 million was financed with borrowings under the company's bank
credit agreement. shade/allied's products are distributed by both the ampad and
williamhouse divisions and the manufacturing plants are integrated into the
ampad division. this acquisition provided the company with a more significant
position in a fourth product category.
 
     on august 16, 1995, the company acquired the file folder and hanging file
product lines of atapco's globe-weis office products division. atapco was one of
the leading providers of file folders and hanging files to office products
superstores. the aggregate acquisition consideration of $20.0 million, including
fees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and seller
notes. the globe-weis acquisition further strengthened the company's position in
the filing supplies and writing products categories.
 
     purchase accounting effects. the company's acquisitions have been accounted
for using the purchase accounting method. the acquisitions have currently
affected, and will prospectively affect, the company's results of operations in
certain significant respects. the aggregate acquisition costs (including
assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair
market value of such net assets. the allocations of the purchase price result in
an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results in
incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year.
 
     raw material. the company's principal raw material is paper. certain
commodity grades utilized by the company have shown considerable price
volatility since 1992. this volatility negatively impacted the company's
earnings in 1994 as a result of the company's inability to implement price
changes in many of its product lines without giving its customers advance
notification. beginning in january 1995, the company adopted new pricing
policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the company's cost of
paper at the time of shipment. from may 1997 through october 1997, all but one
of the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the company increased in cost
between 6% and 18%. due to strategic customer considerations and competitive
market conditions, the company did not begin to recover a significant portion of
the increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until december 1997.
the company continued to
 
                                       23
<page>   16
 
implement sales pricing increases during the first quarter of 1998. paper price
volatility is expected to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost of
sales and there is no assurance that the company will not be materially affected
by future fluctuations in the price of paper. fluctuations in paper prices can
have an effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and
financial condition of the company.
 
results of operations
 
     the following table summarizes the company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for each year in the three year period
ended december 31, 1997. the company's historical results of operations for each
of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the following
businesses acquired by the company: (i) the results of globe-weiss which was
acquired august 16, 1995; (ii) williamhouse which was acquired on october 31,
1995; (iii) niagara which was acquired on june 28, 1996; and (iv) shade/allied
which was acquired on february 11, 1997.

year ended december 31, 1997 compared to year ended december 31, 1996
 
     net sales increased from $583.9 million in 1996 to $687.3 million in 1997,
an increase of $103.4 or 17.7%. of this sales increase, $67.4 million is due to
the acquisition of shade/allied and $50.1 million is due to the inclusion of a
full year of sales from the acquisition of niagara. excluding sales generated by
the shade/allied and niagara acquisitions, sales from the ampad division
increased $14.6 million and sales from the williamhouse division declined $28.5
million. the increase in sales from the ampad division is due primarily to
increased sales volume with the office products superstores and mass market
retail customers. the sales decline for the williamhouse division is primarily
due to lower average selling prices in 1997 due to competitive market conditions
during the year and partly to lower volumes of envelopes sold.
 
     gross profit decreased from $125.4 million, or 21.5% of net sales, in 1996
to $96.9 million, or 14.1% of net sales, in 1997. this $28.5 million decrease is
primarily due to increased paper, material and labor costs which the company did
not recover. during 1997, the company's gross profit in the ampad division was
negatively affected by sales price incentives provided to the division's rapidly
growing office superstores and mass merchants. additionally, the company's gross
profit in the williamhouse division was negatively affected by competitive
market sales pricing conditions. these factors combined with higher material and
labor costs led to significantly lower gross profit in 1997 than in 1996. during
1997, the company incurred approximately $2.8 million in one-time costs relating
to training personnel on new equipment, the training
 
                                       24
<page>   17
 
time needed to expand to 24 hour 7 day shifts and the move to the new salt lake
facility. additionally, the company incurred $1.2 million in fixed costs in 1997
for former shade/allied and williamhouse plants which were closed during 1997
and will not recur in 1998.
 
     during the fourth quarter of 1997, the company announced that it would
incur additional charges due to annual revisions to the lifo reserve and
revisions to cost of sales estimates primarily for the williamhouse division.
these revisions resulted in $13.4 million of additional operating costs. such
revisions for the williamhouse division reflected the effects of higher paper
costs.
 
     selling and marketing expenses increased from $17.0 million in 1996 to
$21.9 million in 1997, or $4.9 million. of this increase, $1.1 million is
attributable to the acquisition of shade/allied and the retention of a portion
of their sales force and customer service personnel and $3.1 million is
primarily attributable to the niagara acquisition and the integration of its
sales force and customer service personnel into the williamhouse division. the
remainder of the increase is attributable to the ampad division, primarily due
to increased sales commissions associated with higher sales.
 
     general and administrative expenses increased from $24.4 million in 1996 to
$27.5 million in 1997, or $3.1 million. of this increase, $0.8 million is
attributable to the acquisition of shade/allied and the remainder is
attributable to increases in corporate expenses associated with the
centralization of certain functions in dallas. during 1997, the company incurred
$2.2 million of expenses related to shade/allied which will not recur in 1998.
 
     losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $1.8 million in 1996
to $3.0 million in 1997 due to a higher average level of accounts receivable
sold to the third party trust during 1997. following the acquisition of niagara
in june 1996, the maximum amount of accounts receivable which the company could
sell to the third party trust at any point in time was raised from $45 million
to $60 million. during 1997, the average level of accounts receivable sold to
the trust was higher than in 1996 and, as a result the losses on sales of
accounts receivable were higher. the losses on sales of accounts receivable
represent the company's cost of using the third party trust to provide off
balance sheet financing of trade accounts receivable.
 
     goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense increased from $4.5
million in 1996 to $6.1 million in 1997, an increase of $1.6 million, due
primarily to a full year of amortization of goodwill associated with the
acquisition of niagara and ten and one-half months of amortization of goodwill
associated with the acquisition of shade/allied.
 
     management fees and services expense for the year ended december 31, 1996
amounted to $3.9 million as compared to $4.9 million for the year ended december
31, 1997. the change in management fees is due primarily to the capitalization
of $0.8 million in bain capital fees in 1996 related to the acquisition of
shade/ allied.
 
     interest expense decreased from $43.0 million in 1996 to $37.8 million in
1997, representing a decrease of $5.2 million. such decrease was due primarily
to the refinancing of the company's credit agreement in july 1996, which
resulted in lower effective interest rates generating an interest savings of
$5.1 million, and the repayment of $70.0 million in senior subordinated notes in
august 1996, which led to an interest expense reduction of approximately $5.5
million. these savings were offset by $3.4 million additional interest expense
due to increases in long-term debt associated with the acquisition of
shade/allied and approximately $2.5 million additional interest expense as a
result of the company's investment in working capital and net increase in
capital expenditures.
 
     the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 1997 reflects an
effective income tax provision rate of 16.7% as compared with the effective
income tax rate of 43.2% for the year ended december 31, 1996. in 1997, the
company's loss before income taxes was relatively low, $3.8 million, in
comparison to the amount of expenses which are not deductible, $5.4 million.
such expenses primarily consist of goodwill amortization, certain travel and
entertainment costs and life insurance for certain current and former employees.
as a result, the company has taxable income for tax reporting purposes versus a
loss for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, the company has incurred a
tax provision for 1997. the company
 
                                       25
<page>   18
 
paid $4.5 million in income taxes during 1997, received an income tax refund of
$3.3 million in january 1998 and expects a refund of $0.8 million in state
income taxes during the second half of 1998.
 
year ended december 31, 1996 compared to year ended december 31, 1995
 
     net sales for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased by $326.7 million,
or 127.0%, to $583.9 million from $257.2 million for the year ended december 31,
1995. of this net sales increase, $274.8 million is related to the acquisition
of williamhouse and niagara and $35.2 million is related to the acquisition of
globe-weis. ampad division net sales increased by $16.7 million during 1996
compared to 1995 due to higher sales to the fast growing customer channels such
as superstores, mass merchant stores and contract stationers.
 
     gross profit for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased by $77.9
million, or 164.0%, to $125.4 million from $47.5 million for the year ended
december 31, 1995. approximately $69.5 million of the increase in gross profit
is attributable to the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara. gross profit
margin increased to 21.5% for the year ended december 31, 1996 from 18.5% for
the year ended december 31, 1995. the increase in gross profit margin is
primarily attributable to higher margins of the williamhouse division.
 
     selling and marketing expenses increased from $6.3 million in 1995 to $17.0
million in 1996, an increase of $10.7 million. of this increase, $9.1 million is
due to the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara and $1.6 million is due to
increased selling and marketing expense for the ampad division resulting from a
higher level of sales in this division.
 
     general and administrative expenses increased from $10.4 million in 1995 to
$24.4 million in 1996, an increase of $14.0 million. of this increase, $8.5
million is associated with the acquisition of williamhouse and niagara. the
remainder is associated with the implementation of a corporate infrastructure as
the company expanded in size.
 
     goodwill and intangible asset amortization increased from $0.9 million in
1995 to $4.5 million in 1996, or an increase of $3.6 million, as a result of the
acquisitions of williamhouse in october 1995 and niagara in june 1996.
 
     losses on sales of accounts receivable increased from $0.4 million to $1.8
million in 1996 due primarily to having the accounts receivable securitization
facility in place for a full year in 1996. such charge represents the losses on
sales of trade accounts receivable from the company to a third party trust and
represents the cost to the company of using an off balance sheet financing
facility for trade accounts receivable.
 
     management fees and services increased $3.3 million in 1996 due to the
amortization of a consulting agreement with a former shareholder of niagara and
an increase in bain capital's management fees.
 
     interest expense for the year ended december 31, 1996 increased $29.3
million to $43.0 million from $13.7 million for the year ended december 31,
1995. the increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstanding
debt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of williamhouse and
globe-weis. the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction
of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense following the redemption of
$70.0 million of the senior subordinated notes in august 1996.
 
     the income tax provision for year ended december 31, 1996 reflects an
effective tax rate of 43.2% versus an effective tax benefit rate of 56.5% for
the year ended december 31, 1995. the effective tax rate for 1996 reflects a 40%
combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for nondeductible
expenses, primarily goodwill amortization. the effective tax rate for the year
ended december 31, 1995 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of
35% due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the company's net operating
loss carryforward.
 
     extraordinary item in 1996 represents an after tax loss on extinguishment
of debt of $20.0 million ($33.0 million pretax) recognized as a result of the
redemption of $70.0 million of senior subordinated notes with a portion of the
net proceeds from the initial public offering and the write off of a portion of
the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the notes and all of the
deferred financing costs associated with the old bank credit agreement and the
old accounts receivable facility.

liquidity and capital resources
 
     cash used by operating activities in 1997 amounted to $62.4 million and
consisted of (i) cash generated from the net loss, after adding back non-cash
charges of $21.1 million, (ii) cash used to fund increases in accounts
receivable of $17.3 million relating to higher sales in 1997 than in 1996.,
(iii) cash used to fund increases in inventories of $44.2 million manufactured
in anticipation of higher sales (iv) an increase in accounts payable of $4.6
million and (v) a decrease in accrued expenses of $22.0 million due primarily to
changes in acquisition integration cost reserves ($8.2 million), reduced
incentive compensation due to payment of bonuses earned in 1996 and no bonus
compensation for 1997 ($4.6 million) and reductions in customer incentive
liabilities due to the timing of the payments to customers ($8.5 million).
charges to the acquisition integration cost reserves consisted primarily of
plant closing, lease termination and severance costs associated with facilities
which have been closed and consolidated into the company's existing operations.
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 1996 was
$23.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $4.7 million
for the year ended december 31, 1995. the increase in cash provided by operating
activities is primarily due to higher net sales and earnings of the company in
1996. the net cash provided for the year ended december 31, 1995 resulted
primarily from an increase of $5.0 million in accounts payable, an increase in
accrued expenses of $4.9 million, a decrease in inventories and increased
margins on sales.
 
     cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 1997 was
due to the acquisition of shade/allied for $50.7 million and purchases of
property and equipment for $23.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales of
equipment and a closed plant for $4.1 million. cash used in investing activities
for the year ended december 31, 1996 and 1995 was $16.2 million and $131.3
million, respectively. the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 1996 was
principally due to the niagara acquisition ($53.0 million, net of cash received)
and purchases of equipment ($14.6 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of
the regency division and other assets held for sale ($49.3 million). the use of
cash for the year ended december 31, 1995, was due to the williamhouse
acquisition ($122.7 million), the globe-weis acquisition ($7.0 million) and
purchase of equipment ($3.9 million).
 
     cash was provided by financing activities in 1997 by increased borrowing
under the company's revolving credit agreement of $130.4 million offset by $2.3
million in payments on industrial revenue bonds and capitalized lease
obligations. at the end of 1997, the company had sold an additional $6 million
of accounts receivable to the third party trust. cash used in financing
activities for the year ended december 31, 1996 was $23.0 million as compared to
a cash provision from financing activities of $144.9 million for the year ended
december 31, 1995. during the year ended december 31, 1996, the company (i)
completed its initial public offering of 12.5 million shares of common stock for
$172.8 million in net proceeds after deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii)
refinanced its accounts receivable facility with a new $60.0 million facility,
(iii) refinanced its bank credit agreement, (iv) redeemed $70.0 million of
senior subordinated notes, (v) repaid $95.8 million of debt incurred under the
old bank credit agreement, (vi) paid $7.7 million in redemption premiums on the
notes, (vii) repaid $10 million under the new accounts receivable facility with
proceeds from the sale of the regency division, (viii) borrowed $54 million
under the new accounts receivable facility and (ix) repaid wr seller notes for
$25 million cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december
31, 1995 was $144.9 million primarily due to periodic financings incurred in
connection with the various acquisitions.
 
     in february 1998, the company and its banking group agreed to an increase
in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
million for a period of one year. after such time, the level of debt available
under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. in december 1997
and february 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were also modified
at the end of 1997 and for a one year period ending in february 1999. the
company will not be subject to a consolidated debt to ebitda ratio until the
first quarter of 1999. interest coverage ratios will be measured quarterly
beginning january 1, 1998. unless approved by the banking group, the company
will be restricted to $15.0 million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and
will be restricted from any acquisitions. the interest cost incurred by the
company will vary each quarter in 1998 depending on the company's consolidated
debt to ebitda ratio at the beginning of each quarter. the company paid a fee of
$1.1 million to its banking group as part of the amendment to the credit
agreement.

     the ability of the company to "comply with the covenants in the credit
agreement," meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be
dependent upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which,
in turn, will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial,
business and other factors, including factors beyond the company's control. "the
operating results for the month of january 1998 were lower than management's
expectations due to the timing of the implementation of price increases and
product line rationalization. as a result, the company is uncertain whether its
operating performance for the first quarter of 1998 will be in full compliance
with covenants in its credit agreement. in the event the company does not meet
the covenants, the company will need to seek waiver from its banking group. a
portion of the consolidated debt of the company bears interest at floating
rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by
changes in prevailing interest rates. the company has entered into an interest
rate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.
 
     management believes that based on current levels of operations and
anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at december 31,
1997 of $4.9 million, will be adequate for 1998 to make required payments of
principal and interest on the company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated
capital expenditures of $13 million in 1998, and to meet working capital
requirements.
 
     the amount of debt available under the company's current credit agreement
decreases by $30.0 million in february 1999 and by an additional $50.0 million
in july 1999. based on the company's current level of operating results and the
expected operating results in 1998 and 1999, the company expects that the
reduction of $30.0 million in february 1999 will not have a significant effect
on its operations. however, the reduction in available borrowing of $50.0
million at the end of 1999 may require the company to explore other financing
alternatives, including but not limited to a refinancing of its bank debt,
raising new private or public debt, raising additional public equity capital,
reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating costs and selling
certain assets. in the event that the company is not able to successfully
complete the financing alternatives just described, the company and its banking
group would be required to negotiate revisions to the terms of the credit
agreement.
 
inflation
 
     the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 1997.
 
newly issued accounting standards
 
     during the fourth quarter of 1997, the company adopted statement of
financial accounting standards no. 128, earnings per share ("sfas 128"). such
adoption resulted in a new presentation of earnings per share amounts as either
"basic" or "diluted." basic earnings per share is calculated as net income
divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. diluted earnings
per share is calculated in a manner similar to the "primary" earnings per share
previously presented by the company. diluted earnings per share is calculated as
net income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, as
adjusted for common stock options. the company has restated its quarterly
earnings per share to present such information in accordance with the new
accounting standard.
 
     in february 1998, the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin no. 98 ("sab 98") which requires the company to present
historical earnings per share for pre-ipo periods even if such information,
historically, was not considered meaningful, in order to be consistent with sfas
128. however, in accordance with sab 98, changes in the company's capital
structure at the time of the initial public offering relative to preferred stock
and preferred stock options conversion to common stock and common stock options
are not presented retroactively. in addition, the number of common shares issued
during the company's initial public offering is not retroactively restated. the
weighted average common shares outstanding under the basic and diluted methods
described in the preceding paragraph reflect only common stock or common stock
options actually outstanding for the periods presented. the 8.1192-for-one
 
                                       28
<page>   21
 
common stock split by the company at the time of its initial public offering has
been retroactively restated for all periods presented.
 
     two new accounting standards, statement of financial accounting standards
no. 130, reporting comprehensive income, and no. 131, disclosures about segments
of an enterprise and related information, will take effect during the first
quarter of 1998. the company does not expect that the adoption of such new
accounting standards will have any significant effects on the company's reported
financial information.
 
computer systems and year 2000
 
     the company has reviewed its current hardware and software systems,
including existing interfaces with vendors and customers, and has determined
that arrival of the year 2000 will not require any significant changes or
modifications to the company's existing systems.
 
forward-looking statements
 
     the company is including the following cautionary statement in this form
10-k to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995 for any forward-looking
statements made by, or on behalf of, the company. forward-looking statements
include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements which are
other than statements of historical facts. from time to time, the company may
publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature.
all such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and
whether made by or on behalf of the company, are also expressly qualified by
these cautionary statements. certain statements contained herein are
forward-looking statements and accordingly involve risks and uncertainties which
could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed
in the forward-looking statements. the forward-looking statements contained
herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon
further assumptions. the company's expectations, beliefs and projections are
expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable
basis, including without limitation, management's examination of historical
operating trends, data contained in the company's records and other data
available from third parties, but there can be no assurance that management's
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished.
in addition to the other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the
following are important factors that, in the view of the company, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking
statements:
 
      1. changes in economic conditions, in particular those which affect the
         retail and wholesale office product markets.
 
      2. changes in the availability and/or price of paper, in particular if
         increases in the price of paper are not passed along to the company's
         customers.
 
      3. changes in senior management or control of the company.
 
      4. inability to obtain new customers or retain existing ones.
 
      5. significant changes in competitive factors, including product pricing
         conditions, affecting the company.
 
      6. governmental/regulatory actions and initiatives, including, those
         affecting financings.
 
      7. significant changes from expectations in actual capital expenditures
         and operating expenses.
 
      8. occurrences affecting the company's ability to obtain funds from
         operations, debt or equity to finance needed capital expenditures and
         other investments.
 
      9. significant changes in rates of interest, inflation or taxes.
 
     10. significant changes in the company's relationship with its employees
         and the potential adverse effects if labor disputes or grievance were
         to occur.
 
                                       29
<page>   22
 
     11. changes in accounting principles and/or the application of such
         principles to the company.
 
     the foregoing factors could affect the company's actual results and could
cause the company's actual results during 1998 and beyond to be materially
different from any anticipated results expressed in any forward-looking
statement made by or on behalf of the company.
 
     the company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or other circumstances after date hereof.

             responsibility for the consolidated financial reports
 
     company management is responsible for the preparation, accuracy and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements and other financial
information included in this annual report. this responsibility includes
preparing the statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and necessarily includes estimates that are based on management's
best judgments.
 
     to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of company financial data,
management maintains internal controls, which are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are executed as authorized, that they are accurately
recorded, and that assets are properly safeguarded. internal financial and
operations management monitors these controls. it is essential for all company
employees to conduct their business affairs in keeping with the highest ethical
standards as outlined in our code of conduct policy. careful selection of
employees, and appropriate divisions of responsibility, also help us to achieve
our control objectives.
 
     the financial statements have been audited by the company's independent
accountants, price waterhouse llp. their report is also shown on this page.
 
     the board of directors, acting through its audit committee composed
entirely of outside directors, oversees the adequacy of the company's control
environment. the audit committee meets periodically with representatives of
price waterhouse llp and internal financial management to review accounting,
control, auditing and financial reporting matters. the independent accountants
also have full and free access to meet privately with the audit committee.

to the board of directors and stockholders of
  american pad &amp; paper company
 
     in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) on page 31 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of american pad &amp; paper company and its subsidiaries at
december 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 1997, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. these financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

      (amounts in thousands, except for per share and percentage amounts)
 
1. organization, basis of presentation and business
 
  organization and basis of presentation
 
     american pad &amp; paper company (formerly ampad holding corporation and
referred to hereafter as the "company") was incorporated on june 2, 1992 as a
holding company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of ampad corporation
("ampad"), the surviving entity from the merger between ampad acquisition
corporation and ampad. the company had no operations through july 31, 1992.
 
     on october 3, 1995, the company agreed to acquire in a merger transaction
all of the outstanding stock of wr acquisition, inc. ("wr"). in a series of
transactions, the company exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly owned
subsidiary, ampad, for newly issued shares of wr. wr then contributed ampad to
its wholly owned subsidiary, williamhouse-regency of delaware, inc., renamed
american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. (referred to hereafter on a
pre-october 31, 1995 basis as "williamhouse-regency" and on a post-october 31,
1995 basis as "ap&amp;p; delaware"), in exchange for a right to receive $140 million
of merger consideration. the company, principally using bank borrowings by ap&amp;p;
delaware aggregating $245 million, funded wr's right to receive the merger
consideration. wr in turn repurchased 100% of the wr shares not owned by the
company. the company accounted for the transaction as a purchase of the stock of
wr. as a result of the transactions, the company now owns 100% of wr, which in
turn owns 100% of ap&amp;p; delaware.
 
     the financial statements of the company include the historical accounts and
operations of the company and ap&amp;p; delaware. included in the historical accounts
and operations of ap&amp;p; delaware are the accounts and operations of ampad, the
envelope operations of williamhouse and niagara, and the computer form
operations of shade/allied since their respective dates of acquisition.
additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
notepad funding corporation ("notepad"), a special purpose corporation utilized
in the accounts receivable facility. all significant intercompany balances have
been eliminated.
 
  american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc.
 
     the company's wholly owned subsidiary, ap&amp;p; delaware, is the issuer of 13%
senior subordinated notes ("notes"). terms of the notes require, among other
matters, that ap&amp;p; delaware provide annual audited and quarterly unaudited
financial statements to the holders of the publicly traded notes. the company is
providing the holders of the notes with its quarterly and annual consolidated
financial statements as well as its periodic reports as filed with the
securities and exchange commission. the company believes that providing such
consolidated financial statements satisfies the financial information and debt
compliance reporting needs of the holders of the notes.
 
     there are no material differences between the financial statements of the
company and of ap&amp;p; delaware. the composition of the ap&amp;p; delaware's
stockholders' equity at december 31, 1997 consists of one hundred shares of
$0.01 par value common stock, paid in capital of $202,357 and an accumulated
deficit of $101,691 and, in total, is equal to the stockholders' equity of the
company.
 
  business
 
     the company is among the larger manufacturers and marketers of paper-based
office products in north america. the company operates in one business segment,
converting paper into office products and offers a broad assortment of products
through two complementary divisions: ampad (writing pads, file folders, retail
envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based office products) and
williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). the company's products are
distributed through large mass merchant retailers, office product superstores,
warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office products wholesalers, paper
merchants, and independent dealers. substantially all sales are to customers
within the united states.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  pro forma information
 
     the pro forma information included in these financial statements and notes
is unaudited.
 
  quarterly financial information
 
     the quarterly financial information included in these financial statements
is unaudited and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial
position, its results of operations and its cash flows. operating results for
any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full
fiscal year.
 
2. summary of significant accounting policies
 
     significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
  use of estimates
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  cash and cash equivalents
 
     the company considers all highly liquid, interest-bearing instruments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
  revenue recognition
 
     the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. all risks and
rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. damaged or defective
products may be returned to the company for replacement or credit. the company
also offers sales volume rebates or contractual allowance payments to customers
based on their level of sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell
the company's products, which aggregate period shall not exceed three years. the
effects of returns, discounts and other incentives are estimated and recorded at
the time of shipment. volume rebates and allowances are estimated and recorded
based on sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell the company's
products.
 
  concentration of credit risk
 
     the company sells its products into various wholesale and retail channels,
primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. management believes
its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business
risks. the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and
does not require collateral. historically, the company has not experienced
significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any
particular industry or geographic area. an allowance is maintained at a level
that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses
including potential losses on receivables sold.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  inventories
 
     inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper products,
are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the last-in,
first-out (lifo) method. costs include material, labor and overhead.
 
  property and equipment
 
     property and equipment are recorded at cost. depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual
assets. significant repairs or betterments, which extend the useful life of an
asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
 
  goodwill and intangible assets
 
     goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired in purchase transactions. goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. intangible assets
represent trade names acquired in the wr and shade/allied acquisitions and are
amortized using the straight-line method. trade names in the aggregate gross
amount of $31,700 and $6,200 for wr and $5,610 for shade/allied, are amortized
over 40, 15 and 40 years, respectively. amortization expense was $879 in 1995,
$4,488 in 1996 and $6,110 in 1997.
 
  long-lived assets
 
     it is the company's policy to periodically review the net realizable value
of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, through an
assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. in the
event that assets are found to be carried at amounts which are in excess of
estimated gross future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the
underlying assets. based upon its most recent analysis, the company does not
believe an impairment of long-lived assets exists at december 31, 1997.
 
  debt issuance costs
 
     costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.
 
  income taxes
 
     the company accounts for income taxes following the liability method, which
prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in the company's financial statements or tax returns.
deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for
deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. the company periodically reviews the realizability
of its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.
 
  derivatives
 
     premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as interest
expense over the term of the agreement. amounts receivable under the interest
rate cap agreement are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  fair value of financial instruments
 
     carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. the carrying value of senior bank debt bearing interest at
floating rates approximates fair value. the carrying value at december 31, 1997
of the notes of $130,000 compares to the notes' fair value of $140,400 based on
quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1997.
 
  earnings per share
 
     basic earnings per share is computed as the quotient of net income (loss)
divided by the weighted average actual number of outstanding shares of common
stock at the end of a year. diluted earnings per share is computed as the
quotient of net income (loss) divided by the number of outstanding shares of
common stock as adjusted for common stock options. the difference between basic
and diluted weighted average shares is due to 1,018 dilutive common stock
options granted through 1996. the adjustment for common stock options is
calculated by assuming that all dilutive options are exercised, that the
proceeds from such exercise are used to repurchase shares of the company's stock
at the average price of the common stock during the period and the company will
also generate proceeds and repurchase shares from the tax benefits associated
with the assumed exercise of the common stock options. options to purchase 50
shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $20.94 per share
were outstanding during the second half of 1996 but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of these
options was greater than the average market price of the common stock. dilutive
earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding are not presented in
1995 and 1997 due to the losses incurred and the anti-dilutive effect of the
common stock options. in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards no. 128, earnings per share, all periods presented in the financial
statements have been restated to adopt this new earnings per share presentation.
 
     in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting
bulletin no. 98, the weighted average number of outstanding common shares and
common stock options is calculated based on the historical timing of the common
stock transactions. the historical numbers do not reflect retroactive treatment
of the company's initial public offering of common stock or the conversion of
preferred stock and preferred stock options; however, the company's
8.1192 -- for -- one stock split in 1996 has been retroactively reflected in the
company's financial statements.
 
  reclassifications
 
     certain amounts in the 1995 and 1996 consolidated financial statements,
none of which have an effect on net income (loss), have been reclassified to
conform to the presentation in the 1997 consolidated financial statements.

for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, elimination of
duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related income tax
effects). the summary for the year ended december 31, 1995 presents the results
of operations as if the niagara, wr and globe acquisitions had occurred as of
january 1, 1995 (with appropriate adjustments for amortization of intangible
assets, interest expense, elimination of duplicate selling and administrative
expenses and the related income tax effects). as shade/allied was acquired
effective february 11, 1997, the pro forma results for the year ended december

     the company originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a revolving
pool of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in october 1995. on may 24, 1996,
the company entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with similar
terms. at december 31, 1996 and 1997, $54,000 and $60,000 of accounts receivable
were sold respectively under this facility. the accompanying balance sheets
exclude the sold accounts receivable. the full amount of the allowance for
doubtful accounts has been retained because the company has retained
substantially the same risk of credit loss as if the receivables had not been
sold through the recourse provision of the receivable sale agreement. under the
agreement, the maximum amount of the purchaser's investment is subject to change
based on the level of eligible receivables and restrictions on concentrations of
receivables. the total cost of the program was $423 in 1995, $1,823 in 1996 and
$2,954 in 1997. the agreement expires in 2000.
 
     bad debt expense for 1995, 1996 and 1997 was immaterial.

     in connection with the wr, niagara, and shade/allied acquisitions, total
inventories for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,845 to fair
market value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical lifo reserves.
since the company is on the lifo method of accounting, such write-up formed the
historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.
there were no liquidations of lifo inventories in 1997. liquidation of lifo
layers in 1995 and 1996 was not material.

  senior bank debt
 
     contemporaneously with the company's initial public offering of common
stock, the company refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the
old bank credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. the new
bank credit agreement, as amended, is a revolving credit facility with a maximum
availability of $330,000 with the following principal terms. loans are made
directly to ap&amp;p; delaware and are guaranteed by the company and each of its
subsidiaries, other than notepad. loans made under the new bank credit agreement
bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to, at the company's option, the base
rate, plus an applicable margin, or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin,
as such terms are defined in the agreement and amendments. the applicable margin
for base rate loans varies from .5% to 1.5% and the applicable margin for
eurodollar rate loans varies from 1.5% to 2.5%, each based on the company's
leverage ratio and the type of loan. availability under the new bank credit
agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is a percentage of the
unutilized revolving loan commitment. the percentage varies from .3% to .5%
based on the company's leverage ratio.
 
     availability under the new bank credit agreement as amended is reduced to
the extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by the company, the net
proceeds of an issuance of debt by the company or 50% of the net proceeds of an
issuance of equity by the company. availability will be reduced by $80,000 in
1999 and $50,000 in 2000. the new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001.

     the new bank credit agreement and amendments require the company to meet
certain financial tests, including minimum levels of ebitda (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in
the agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. the
agreement also contains covenants, which, among other things, limit the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. in addition no dividends may be paid prior to march 31, 1999, the
company will not incur capital expenditures during 1998 in excess of $15,000 and
future acquisitions require the written consent of the banks. the new bank
credit agreement contains customary events of default, including payment
defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults,
cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and
insolvency, erisa, judgment defaults, failure of any guaranty or security
agreement supporting the bank credit agreement to be in full force and effect,
and change of control.
 
     the new bank credit agreement requires the company to continue its interest
rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the old bank credit
agreement. in january 1996, the company entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles the company to receive from the counterpart on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which libor exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. the counterpart to this agreement is a large financial institution.
 
     the new bank credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and all its
subsidiaries, except for notepad, and is secured by substantially all the assets
of ap&amp;p; delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of ap&amp;p; delaware and its
subsidiaries.
 
  senior subordinated notes
 
     ap&amp;p; delaware issued $200,000 of 13% senior subordinated notes ("notes")
through a private placement in december 1995. in june 1996, ap&amp;p; delaware
completed an exchange of the privately held notes for publicly held notes with
substantially identical terms. the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all
senior bank debt. interest is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15.
the notes are redeemable on and after november 15, 2000, at ap&amp;p; delaware's
option, at redemption prices ranging from 106.5% of the face value of the notes
in 2000 to 100% of the face value of the notes in 2003 or thereafter.
additionally, at any time on or prior to november 15, 1998, ap&amp;p; delaware may,
at its option, use the proceeds of public equity offerings of the company or
ap&amp;p; delaware to redeem up to 35% of the notes at redemption prices ranging from
111% to 113% of the face value of the notes. subsequent to the company's initial
public offering of common stock in july 1996, ap&amp;p; delaware repaid $70,000 of
the notes.
 
     the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all subsidiaries of
ap&amp;p; delaware, except for notepad, on a joint, several and senior subordinated
basis, however, no guarantee from the company exists. the notes contain
restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit dividends, repurchase of
capital stock and investments, incurrence of additional indebtedness,
transactions with affiliates and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements.
 
     on december 1, 1995, $200,000 of proceeds were received from the notes and
were used to repurchase $100,000 of publicly-held notes of williamhouse-regency
assumed in the wr acquisition and redeem preferred stock, preferred stock
equivalents, and class p common stock in the aggregate amount of $75,000.

approximately $8,620 in 1996 which have been deferred and are being amortized
using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the agreements.
 
     an extraordinary after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,995
($33,004 pre-tax) is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended december 31, 1996 as a result of $7,700 of prepayment penalties
associated with the repayment of $70,000 of notes and the write off of $25,304
of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with such notes and with
the company's old bank credit agreement. an extraordinary after-tax loss on
extinguishment of debt of $9,652 ($16,086 pretax) is reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 1995 as a
result of $10,812 of prepayment penalties associated with the repurchase of
williamhouse-regency's $100,000 of notes and ampad's bank debt and the write-off
of $5,274 of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with
williamhouse-regency's notes redemption and ampad's debt refinancings.
 
10. stockholders' equity, stock options and nonrecurring compensation charge
 
     effective july 2, 1996, the company sold 12,500 shares of common stock in
an initial public offering. the net proceeds to the company from the offering,
which were received on july 8, 1996, amounted to $172,801 after deducting
underwriting discounts, legal and accounting fees, registration and travel
expenses. the company used proceeds from the initial public offering and working
capital to: (i) repay $95,800 on the indebtedness incurred under the old bank
credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the 13% notes from the
holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in redemption premium
on such notes.
 
     prior to the completion of the initial public offering, the company's
shareholders approved an 8.1192-for-one stock split for all of the then
outstanding common stock shares and common stock options. concurrently with the
stock split, all of the outstanding preferred stock and preferred stock options
were converted into shares of common stock and common stock options,
respectively, using a conversion price determined by dividing the preferred
stock liquidation value of $1,948.50 per share by the initial public offering
price per share of $15. all common stock share amounts have been restated to
reflect the stock split; however, the common stock share amounts have not been
restated to reflect the conversion of preferred stock and preferred stock
options.
 
     the preferred stock has no dividend rights and, except as required by law,
is nonvoting. as of december 31, 1995, after giving effect to satisfaction of
its preferred redemption values, the company's class p common stock was also
converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock.
 
     at january 1, 1995, options for 1,026 shares of common stock had been
issued to certain members of the company's management under the 1992 key
employee stock option plan (the "1992 plan") in two separate tranches -- "core"
stock options for 758 shares and "performance" stock options for 268 shares. the
exercise price of all options equaled or exceeded the fair market value at date
of grant. in connection with the wr acquisition effective october 31, 1995, the
company's equity was recapitalized via a stock dividend of one share of
preferred stock for every ten shares of common stock and class p common stock
and options to purchase common stock. concurrently, preferred stock options were
granted to holders of common stock options and the respective exercise prices
were adjusted to maintain option holders' pro rata economic interests pursuant
to antidilution provisions included in the existing stock option plans.

     the issuance of the preferred stock options was considered additional
consideration to restore the option holders' economic position as a result of
the recapitalization, which was directly related to the wr acquisition. receipt
of such consideration resulted in a nonrecurring, noncash compensation charge
equal to the excess of fair market value over the exercise price of the
preferred stock options of $24,265 with a corresponding credit being recorded to
additional paid-in capital. the adjustment to the underlying common stock
option's prices did not result in additional compensation expense in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     additionally, options for 66 shares of common stock and 105 shares of
preferred stock were granted to certain members of management in december 1995.
the exercise prices of $0.007 per common share and $.028 per preferred share
were below the fair market value of the respective classes of stock at date of
grant, resulting in a noncash compensation charge equal to the aggregate excess
of fair market value over the exercise price, or $1,733, with a corresponding
credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.
 
     the company awarded additional compensation to executives and nonexecutives
of $1,634 in 1995 in recognition of the significant transactions consummated
during the year. the company does not expect this additional compensation to be
awarded in future years.

company granted options to purchase 742 shares of common stock at a weighted
average purchase price of $15 per share.
 
     non-employee director plan. on june 22, 1996, the company adopted the
non-employee director stock option plan. pursuant to the non-employee director
plan, each director (other than directors who are employees of the company) will
receive a one-time option grant to purchase 25 shares of common stock upon
effectiveness of the non-employee director plan or, for new directors, upon

vesting in the first year and 25% in the remaining two years. the annual grants
will vest in three equal installments. the exercise price for all options
granted under the non-employee director plan will be at fair market value as of
the time of such grant. options granted under the non-employee director plan
would generally terminate ten years after the date such options become
exercisable. an aggregate of 350 shares of common stock has been reserved for
issuance under the non-employee director plan. during 1996, the company granted

directors at a weighted average purchase price of $17.38 per share.

in years. the average fair value of common stock options granted in 1996 was
$8.835 per share. there were no options granted in 1997.
 
     in 1996, the company adopted the disclosure-only option under statement of
financial accounting standards no. 123, accounting for stock-based compensation,

     on a pro forma basis, if the company had recorded compensation expense in
1996 and 1997 for the stock options granted in accordance with the accounting
provisions of sfas no. 123, the pro forma net income (loss) before extraordinary

income (loss) per share before extraordinary item would have been $1.02 and
$(0.21), respectively; and the diluted pro forma net income (loss) per share

     the effect on the income tax provision related to the valuation allowance
was a benefit of $1,769 for the year ended december 31, 1995. deferred tax
assets valuation allowances recorded in prior years were reversed in 1995 as a
result of management's assessment of future realizability of deferred tax
assets.
 
     at december 31, 1997, the company had net operating losses available to
reduce future taxable income of approximately $30,900. these net operating
losses expire in the years 2007 through 2012. if certain substantial changes in
the company's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the
amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized. in addition, the company has
approximately $1,406 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. the
acquisition of wr resulted in a change in control of wr. consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.
 
13. commitments and contingencies
 
  commitments
 
     the company is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for office
space and machinery and equipment, which expire at various times through 2016.
annual minimum lease commitments under these leases amount to $5,886 in 1998,
$5,007 in 1999, $3,813 in 2000, $3,249 in 2001, $2,911 in 2002 and $25,853
thereafter for an aggregate of $46,719.
 
     total rent expense was approximately $1,888, $3,551, $6,572 for 1995, 1996
and 1997 respectively.
 
  litigation
 
     on march 10, 1998, the company, certain of its officers and directors,
certain former controlling stockholders and certain investment banking firms
that participated in the company's ipo were named in a civil action filed in the
united states district court in the northern district of texas, dallas division.
the complaint, a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of the company's
common stock between july 2, 1996 and december 17, 1997, alleges violation of
the federal securities laws for failure to disclose certain facts about the
company's operations in connection with the company's ipo and in certain
periodic reports. the complaint seeks unspecified damages and any other relief
permitted by law. the company believes that the allegations in the complaint are
without merit, and the company intends to rigorously defend itself.

     there are various other outstanding claims against the company arising in
the normal course of business. the company believes that these claims are
without merit and that any losses which might ultimately be sustained by the
company would not be material to the financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows of the company.
 
  environmental matters
 
     the company is subject to federal, state, and local environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations. such laws and regulations
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for
management of waste. while there can be no assurance that the company is at all
times in complete compliance with all such requirements, the company has made
and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements.
 
     the company had been named a potentially responsible party under the
federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of
1980, as amended, at five waste disposal sites. the company settled its
liability at four of these sites as a de minimis party. the company expects to
be eligible for a de minimis settlement at the remaining site.
 
14. related party transactions
 
     for the years ended december 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the company expensed

17. condensed consolidating financial information of guarantor subsidiary

wholly owned subsidiary of american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc.
("delaware"). the subsidiary guaranty is full, unconditional and joint and
several. the company is not a guarantor of the senior subordinated notes.

first period in which the company's historical results include the results of
operations of shade/allied and is the first period where shade/allied was a
guarantor subsidiary. the condensed consolidating financial information is as

to the board of directors and stockholder of
  american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc.
     (a wholly owned subsidiary of american pad &amp; paper company)
 
     in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) on page 31 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. and its
subsidiaries at december 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. these
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

1. organization, basis of presentation and business
 
  organization and basis of presentation
 
     american pad &amp; paper co. of delaware, inc. ("delaware") is a wholly owned
subsidiary of american pad &amp; paper company ( "ap&amp;p;") (formerly ampad holding
corporation and referred to hereafter as the "company"). ap&amp;p; was incorporated
on june 2, 1992 as a holding company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of
ampad corporation ("ampad"), the surviving entity from the merger between ampad
acquisition corporation and ampad. the company had no operations through july
31, 1992.
 
     on october 3, 1995, the company agreed to acquire in a merger transaction
all of the outstanding stock of wr acquisition, inc. ("wr"). in a series of
transactions, the company exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly owned
subsidiary, ampad, for newly issued shares of wr. wr then contributed ampad to
its wholly owned subsidiary, williamhouse-regency of delaware, inc., renamed
american pad &amp; paper company of delaware, inc. (referred to hereafter on a
pre-october 31, 1995 basis as "williamhouse-regency" and on a post-october 31,
1995 basis as "delaware"), in exchange for a right to receive $140 million of
merger consideration. the company, principally using bank borrowings by delaware
aggregating $245 million, funded wr's right to receive the merger consideration.
wr in turn repurchased 100% of the wr shares not owned by the company. the
company accounted for the transaction as a purchase of the stock of wr. as a
result of the transactions, the company now owns 100% of wr, which in turn owns
100% of delaware.
 
     the financial statements of delaware include the historical accounts and
operations of delaware and the accounts and operations of ampad, the envelope
operations of williamhouse and niagara, and the computer form operations of
shade/allied since their respective dates of acquisition. additionally, the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of notepad funding
corporation ("notepad"), a special purpose corporation utilized in the accounts
receivable facility. all significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.
 
  american pad &amp; paper company
 
     ap&amp;p; is a holding company whose common stock is publicly traded on the new
york stock exchange under the symbol "agp" with no operations other then its
investment in delaware. except for the preferred and common stock shares of ap&amp;p;
issued, authorized and outstanding, and the related capital contributions by
ap&amp;p; and dividends to ap&amp;p;, there are no material differences between the
financial statements of the company and of ap&amp;p; delaware. ap&amp;p; has followed full
push-down accounting in the presentation of the consolidated financial
statements of delaware.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  quarterly financial information
 
     the quarterly financial information included in these financial statements
is unaudited and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of delaware's financial position,
its results of operations and its cash flows. operating results for any
particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal
year.
 
2. summary of significant accounting policies
 
     significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 
  use of estimates
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  cash and cash equivalents
 
     delaware considers all highly liquid, interest-bearing instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
  revenue recognition
 
     delaware recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. all risks and
rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. damaged or defective
products may be returned to delaware for replacement or credit. delaware also
offers sales volume rebates or contractual allowance payments to customers based
on their level of sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell
delaware's products, which aggregate period shall not exceed three years. the
effects of returns, discounts and other incentives are estimated and recorded at
the time of shipment. volume rebates and allowances are estimated and recorded
based on sales activity or period of time customers agree to sell delaware's
products.
 
  concentration of credit risk
 
     delaware sells its products into various wholesale and retail channels,
primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. management believes
its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business
risks. delaware performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and does
not require collateral. historically, delaware has not experienced significant
losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular
industry or geographic area. an allowance is maintained at a level that
management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses including
potential losses on receivables sold.
 
  inventories
 
     inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper products,
are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the last-in,
first-out (lifo) method. costs include material, labor and overhead.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
  property and equipment
 
     property and equipment are recorded at cost. depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual
assets. significant repairs or betterments, which extend the useful life of an
asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
 
  goodwill and intangible assets
 
     goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of
companies acquired in purchase transactions. goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. intangible assets
represent trade names acquired in the wr and shade/allied acquisitions and are
amortized using the straight-line method. trade names in the aggregate gross
amount of $31,700 and $6,200 for wr and $5,610 for shade/allied, are amortized
over 40, 15 and 40 years, respectively. amortization expense was $879 in 1995,
$4,488 in 1996 and $6,110 in 1997.
 
  long-lived assets
 
     it is delaware's policy to periodically review the net realizable value of
its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, through an
assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. in the
event that assets are found to be carried at amounts which are in excess of
estimated gross future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for
impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the
underlying assets. based upon its most recent analysis, delaware does not
believe an impairment of long-lived assets exists at december 31, 1997.
 
  debt issuance costs
 
     costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.
 
  income taxes
 
     delaware accounts for income taxes following the liability method, which
prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in delaware's financial statements or tax returns.
deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for
deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. delaware periodically reviews the realizability of
its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.
 
  derivatives
 
     premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as interest
expense over the term of the agreement. amounts receivable under the interest
rate cap agreement are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.
 
  fair value of financial instruments
 
     carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. the carrying value of senior bank debt bearing interest at
floating rates approximates fair value. the carrying value at december 31, 1997
of the notes of $130,000 compares to the notes' fair value of $140,400 based on
quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1997.

  earnings per share
 
     earnings per share are not presented because delaware's common stock is not
publicly traded.
 
  reclassifications
 
     certain amounts in the 1995 and 1996 consolidated financial statements,
none of which have an effect on net income (loss), have been reclassified to
conform to the presentation in the 1997 consolidated financial statements.

           notes to consolidated financial statements -- (continued)
 
$147,853 and consisted of cash of $140,000 and direct acquisition costs of

assumed as follows: accounts receivable of $39,174; inventories of $49,496;
prepaid expenses and other assets of $8,699; net assets held for sale of
$41,179; property and equipment of $81,682; identifiable intangible assets of

nonstrategic asset held for sale. the purchase price allocated to the net assets
acquired included the expected proceeds from sale plus the net cash flows
expected to be generated from the personalizing division from the date of
acquisition through the expected date of sale (the holding period), offset by
interest expense incurred during the holding period on debt incurred to finance
the purchase of the personalizing division. on june 27, 1996, the personalizing
division was sold for net proceeds of $47,890. the net proceeds from the sale
exceeded the carrying amount of the asset held for sale by $1,599. as such, the
preliminary purchase price allocation was adjusted resulting in a $959 addition
to goodwill. during the six month period ended june 30, 1996, the personalizing
division had operating income of $2,369 and interest carrying costs of $1,884,
which have been excluded from the condensed consolidated statement of operations

sale through the date of sale.

equipment of the file folder and hanging file folder product lines of
globe-weis's ("globe") office products division from globe's parent. for
financial reporting purposes, this acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was
allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net assets.
the aggregate acquisition costs totaled $19,958 and consisted of cash and seller
issued notes of $17,869 and direct acquisition and financing costs of $2,089.
delaware principally financed the acquisition through its financing arrangement
with a commercial lender and notes issued to the seller. the allocation of the
aggregate acquisition costs was as follows: inventories of $11,546, equipment of
$6,747, and debt issuance costs of $1,665. the operating results of this
acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition.
 
  strategic assimilation of acquisitions
 
     certain costs are expected to be incurred in connection with delaware's
separate strategic plans to integrate and consolidate certain plant,
administrative, sales and corporate functions of williamhouse, niagara and
shade/allied and the associated net reduction of approximately 500 employees.
such costs, aggregating $27,500, include lease termination expenses, severance
and contractual change of control benefits, the liabilities that were included
in the purchase price allocation within accrued expenses. the remaining $8,534
in accrued acquisition integration costs is intended to cover the costs of
closing and integrating six manufacturing facilities and one distribution
facility which are expected to be completed during the next two to three years.

  pro forma results of operations
 
     the following summary for the year ended december 31, 1996 presents the
results of operations on a pro forma basis, as if the niagara and shade/allied
acquisitions had occurred as of january 1, 1996 (with appropriate adjustments
for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, elimination of
duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related income tax
effects). the summary for the year ended december 31, 1995 presents the results
of operations as if the niagara, wr and globe acquisitions had occurred as of
january 1, 1995 (with appropriate adjustments for amortization of intangible
assets, interest expense, elimination of duplicate selling and administrative
expenses and the related income tax effects). as shade/allied was acquired
effective february 11, 1997, the pro forma results for the year ended december
31, 1997 are not materially different from the actual results and therefore are
not reported here. the pro forma operating results are for illustrative purposes
only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results which would have
occurred had the transaction been consummated as of those earlier dates, nor are
they indicative of results of operations which may occur in the future.

     delaware originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a revolving
pool of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in october 1995. on may 24, 1996,
delaware entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with similar
terms. at december 31, 1996 and 1997, $54,000 and $60,000 of accounts receivable
were sold respectively under this facility. the accompanying balance sheets
exclude the sold accounts receivable. the full amount of the allowance for
doubtful accounts has been retained because delaware has retained substantially
the same risk of credit loss as if the receivables had not been sold through the
recourse provision of the receivable sale agreement. under the agreement, the
maximum amount of the purchaser's investment is subject to change based on the
level of eligible receivables and restrictions on concentrations of receivables.
the total cost of the program was $423 in 1995, $1,823 in 1996 and $2,954 in
1997. the agreement expires in 2000.
 
     bad debt expense for 1995, 1996 and 1997 was immaterial.

     in connection with the wr, niagara, and shade/allied acquisitions, total
inventories for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,845 to fair
market value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical lifo reserves.
since delaware is on the lifo method of accounting, such write-up formed the
historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.
there were no liquidations of lifo inventories in 1997. liquidation of lifo
layers in 1995 and 1996 was not material.

  senior bank debt
 
     contemporaneously with the company's initial public offering of common
stock, delaware refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the old
bank credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. the new bank
credit agreement, as amended, is a revolving credit facility with a maximum
availability of $330,000 with the following principal terms. loans are made
directly to delaware and are guaranteed by the company and each of its
subsidiaries, other than notepad. loans made under the new bank

credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to, at delaware's
option, the base rate, plus an applicable margin, or a eurodollar rate plus an
applicable margin, as such terms are defined in the agreement and amendments.
the applicable margin for base rate loans varies from .5% to 1.5% and the
applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans varies from 1.5% to 2.5%, each based
on delaware's leverage ratio and the type of loan. availability under the new
bank credit agreement is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is a
percentage of the unutilized revolving loan commitment. the percentage varies
from .3% to .5% based on delaware's leverage ratio.
 
     availability under the new bank credit agreement as amended is reduced to
the extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by delaware, the net proceeds
of an issuance of debt by delaware or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance of
equity by the company or delaware. availability will be reduced by $80,000 in
1999 and $50,000 in 2000. the new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001.
 
     the new bank credit agreement and amendments require delaware to meet
certain financial tests, including minimum levels of ebitda (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in
the agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. the
agreement also contains covenants, which, among other things, limit the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. in addition no dividends may be paid prior to march 31, 1999,
delaware will not incur capital expenditures during 1998 in excess of $15,000
and future acquisitions require the written consent of the banks. the new bank
credit agreement contains customary events of default, including payment
defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults,
cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and
insolvency, erisa, judgment defaults, failure of any guaranty or security
agreement supporting the bank credit agreement to be in full force and effect,
and change of control.
 
     the new bank credit agreement requires delaware to continue its interest
rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the old bank credit
agreement. in january 1996, delaware entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles delaware to receive from the counterpart on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which libor exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. the counterpart to this agreement is a large financial institution.

subsidiaries, except for notepad, and is secured by substantially all the assets
of delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of delaware and its subsidiaries.
 
  senior subordinated notes
 
     delaware issued $200,000 of 13% senior subordinated notes ("notes") through
a private placement in december 1995. in june 1996, delaware completed an
exchange of the privately held notes for publicly held notes with substantially
identical terms. the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all senior bank
debt. interest is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15. the notes are
redeemable on and after november 15, 2000, at delaware's option, at redemption
prices ranging from 106.5% of the face value of the notes in 2000 to 100% of the
face value of the notes in 2003 or thereafter. additionally, at any time on or
prior to november 15, 1998, delaware may, at its option, use the proceeds of
public equity offerings of the company or delaware to redeem up to 35% of the

delaware, except for notepad, on a joint, several and senior subordinated basis,
however, no guarantee from the company exists. the notes contain restrictive
covenants which, among other things, limit dividends, repurchase of capital
stock and

under the old bank credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the
13% notes from the holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in

with a corresponding credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.
additionally, options for 66 shares of common stock of the company and 105
shares of preferred stock of the company were granted to certain members of
management in december 1995. the exercise prices of each common share and each
preferred share were below the fair market value of the respective classes of
stock at date of grant, resulting in a noncash compensation charge equal to the
aggregate excess of fair market value over the exercise price, or $1,733, with a
corresponding credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.

     the effect on the income tax provision related to the valuation allowance
was a benefit of $1,769 for the year ended december 31, 1995. deferred tax

future taxable income of approximately $30,900. these net operating losses
expire in the years 2007 through 2012. if certain substantial changes in
delaware's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the
amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized. in addition, delaware has
approximately $1,406 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. the
acquisition of wr resulted in a change in control of wr. consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.

will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements.

6.25%, fully secured by the 288 shares of common stock. this individual intends
to draw on this note by the end of march 1998. in january 1998, the company's
board of directors approved an extension of 18 months to exercise 299 common
