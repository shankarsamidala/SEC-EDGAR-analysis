item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and
           results of operations.


overview

         at&amp;t; corp.  (at&amp;t; or the  company) is among the world's  communications
leaders, providing voice, data, video and broadband  telecommunications services
to large and small  businesses,  consumers and government  agencies.  we provide
domestic  and  international  long  distance;   regional,   local  and  wireless
communications  services;  cable television and internet communication services.
at&amp;t; also provides billing,  directory and calling-card  services to support our
communications businesses.

merger with mediaone group, inc.

         we completed the merger with mediaone  group,  inc.  (mediaone) on june
15, 2000, in a cash and stock  transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
we issued  approximately  603 million shares,  of which 60 million were treasury
shares, and made cash payments of approximately $24 billion.

         the merger was recorded under the purchase  method of  accounting,  and
accordingly,  the  results of mediaone  have been  included  with the  financial
results of at&amp;t;,  within our broadband  segment,  since the date of acquisition.
periods  prior to the  merger  were not  restated  to  include  the  results  of
mediaone.

tracking stocks

         on  april  27,  2000,  at&amp;t;  issued a new  class of stock to track  the
performance  of at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  at&amp;t;  sold 360  million  shares  of at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking  shares at a price of $29.50 per share.  the 360 million
shares track  approximately  16% of the financial  performance  of at&amp;t; wireless
group.

         in   addition,   in   connection   with   the   1999   acquisition   of
tele-communications, inc. (tci), renamed at&amp;t; broadband (broadband), at&amp;t; issued
a separate tracking stock to reflect the financial  performance of liberty media
group (lmg), tci's former programming and technology investment businesses.  the
outstanding  liberty  media group  tracking  stock tracks 100% of the  financial
performance of lmg.

         the remaining  results of operations of at&amp;t;,  including  approximately
84% of the financial  performance of at&amp;t; wireless group, are referred to as the
at&amp;t; common stock group and are represented by at&amp;t; common stock.

         a  tracking  stock is  designed  to  provide  financial  returns to its
holders based on the financial  performance  and economic value of the assets it
tracks.  ownership of shares of at&amp;t; common stock,  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock or liberty  media class a or b tracking  stock does not represent a direct
legal  interest  in the  assets and  liabilities  of any of the  groups,  but an
ownership  of at&amp;t; in total.  the specific  shares  represent an interest in the
economic performance of the net assets of each of the groups.

         the   earnings   attributable   to  at&amp;t;   wireless   group   represent
approximately  16% of the  earnings  from april 27, 2000,  through  december 31,
2000,  and are excluded from the earnings  available to at&amp;t; common stock group.
similarly, the earnings and losses related to lmg are excluded from the earnings
available to at&amp;t; common stock group.
<page>

         we do not have a  controlling  financial  interest in lmg for financial
accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  lmg  is  reflected  as an
investment  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  in  at&amp;t;'s  consolidated
financial  statements.  the amounts  attributable  to lmg are  reflected  in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as "equity earnings (losses) from
liberty  media  group"  and  "investment  in  liberty  media  group and  related
receivables, net".

restructuring of at&amp;t;

         on october 25, 2000,  we  announced a  restructuring  plan  designed to
fully  separate  or issue  separately  tracked  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial  performance  and economic  value of each of the company's  four major
operating  units.  upon completion of the plan,  at&amp;t; wireless,  at&amp;t; broadband,
at&amp;t;  business and at&amp;t;  consumer  will all be  represented  by  asset-based  or
tracking stocks.

         as part of the first phase of the  restructuring  plan, we are planning
an exchange offer that will give at&amp;t;  shareowners  the  opportunity to exchange
any  portion of their at&amp;t;  common  shares  for  shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group
tracking stock, subject to pro-ration.  following the exchange offer and subject
to specified conditions,  at&amp;t; plans to split-off at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t.;
we intend,  however,  to retain up to $3 billion of shares of at&amp;t;  wireless for
future sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.
we expect at&amp;t; wireless  will become an  independent,  publicly-held  company in
mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals.

         in  addition  to the  split-off  of at&amp;t;  wireless,  we intend to fully
separate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial  performance
and economic value of each of our other major business  units. we plan to create
and issue new classes of stock to track the financial  performance  and economic
value of our at&amp;t;  broadband  unit and at&amp;t; consumer  unit. we plan to sell some
percentage of shares of the at&amp;t; broadband  unit in the fall of 2001.  within 12
months of such sale, we intend to completely  separate at&amp;t; broadband from at&amp;t;,
as an  asset-based  stock.  the at&amp;t; consumer  tracking  stock is expected to be
fully distributed to at&amp;t; shareowners in the second half of 2001.

         at&amp;t;  expects  that  these   transactions  will  be  tax-free  to  u.s.
shareholders.   at&amp;t;'s   restructuring   plan  is  complicated  and  involves  a
substantial  number  of steps  and  transactions,  including  obtaining  various
conditions,  such as internal revenue service (irs) rulings. in addition, future
financial conditions,  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur
that make it  inadvisable  to proceed  with part or all of at&amp;t;'s  restructuring
plan. any or all of the elements of at&amp;t;'s  restructuring  plan may not occur as
we currently  expect or in the timeframes that we currently  contemplate,  or at
all.  alternative forms of restructuring,  including sales of interests in these
businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution  to shareowners in
the restructuring.

         on november 15, 2000, we announced that our board of directors voted to
split-off  lmg.  a new  asset-based  security  will be issued to  holders of lmg
tracking stock in exchange for their lmg tracking shares.  the split-off remains
subject to receipt  of a  favorable  tax  ruling  from the irs.  we expect  this
split-off to be completed in mid-2001.

flows, dividends,  financing plans, business strategies,  operating efficiencies
or synergies,  budgets,  capital and other  expenditures,  network build out and
upgrade,  competitive positions,  availability of capital,  growth opportunities
for  existing  products,  benefits  from  new  technologies,   availability  and
deployment of new  technologies,  plans and objectives of management,  and other
matters.

         these forward-looking statements,  including, without limitation, those
relating to the future business prospects,  revenue, working capital, liquidity,
capital needs,  network build out,  interest costs and income,  are  necessarily
estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those suggested by the forward-looking  statements.  these  forward-looking
statements  should,  therefore,  be  considered  in light of  various  important
factors that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from estimates or
projections  contained  in the  forward-looking  statements  including,  without
limitation:

         o        the  risks  associated  with  the   implementation  of  at&amp;t;'s
                  restructuring  plan,  which  is  complicated  and  involves  a
                  substantial   number  of  different   transactions  each  with
                  separate  conditions,  any or all of which may not occur as we
                  currently  intend,  or which may not occur in the timeframe we
                  currently expect,

         o        the risks  associated with each of at&amp;t;'s main business units,
                  operating as independent  entities as opposed to as part of an
                  integrated telecommunications provider following completion of
                  at&amp;t;'s  restructuring  plan,  including the inability of these
                  groups to rely on the financial and  operational  resources of
                  the  combined  company  and these  groups  having  to  provide
                  services that were previously  provided by a different part of
                  the combined company,

         o        the impact of existing and new  competitors  in the markets in
                  which these groups  compete,  including  competitors  that may
                  offer less  expensive  products  and  services,  desirable  or
                  innovative  products,   technological  substitutes,   or  have
                  extensive resources or better financing.

         o        the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting  from excessive
                  deployment of network capacity,

         o        the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in
                  the  telecommunications  industry,  which  trend  may have the
                  effect of making the  competitors of these entities larger and
                  better  financed and afford these  competitors  with extensive
                  resources  and  greater  geographic  reach,  allowing  them to
                  compete more effectively,

         o        the  effects of vigorous  competition  in the markets in which
                  the  company  operates,  which may  decrease  prices  charged,
                  increase  churn and change  customer  mix,  profitability  and
                  average revenue per user,

         o        the ability to enter into agreements  to provide, and the cost
                  of  entering  new  markets   necessary to  provide, nationwide
                  services,
<page>

         o        the  ability to establish a significant market presence in new
                  geographic  and service markets,

         o        the  availability and cost of capital and  the consequences of
                  increased leverage,

         o        the successful  execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic
                  assets as part of an overall  corporate deleveraging plan,

         o        the  potential  impact  of ntt  docomo's  investment  in at&amp;t;,
                  including  provisions  of the  agreements  that  restrict at&amp;t;
                  wireless  group's future  operations,  and provisions that may
                  require at&amp;t; to repurchase  docomo's  interest in at&amp;t; if at&amp;t;
                  or at&amp;t; wireless group fail to meet specified conditions,

         o        the  impact  of  any  unusual  items  resulting  from  ongoing
                  evaluations  of  the  business  strategies of the company,

         o        the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to
                  competitors by the federal communications  commission (fcc) or
                  state regulatory  commissions under the telecommunications act
                  of 1996 or other applicable laws and regulations,

         o        the  risks  and  costs  associated  with  the  need to acquire
                  additional wireless  spectrum for current and future services,

         o        the   risks  associated   with    technological  requirements,
                  technology  substitution and changes   and other technological
                  developments,

         o        the  results of  litigation filed  or to be  filed against the
                  company,

         o        the  possibility  of one or more of the  markets  in which the
                  company  competes  being  impacted  by changes  in  political,
                  economic or other factors,  such as monetary policy, legal and
                  regulatory  changes or other external factors over which these
                  groups have no control, and

         o        the  risks  related  to at&amp;t;'s  investments  in lmg  and joint
                  ventures.

future, at&amp;t;, through its senior management, may make forward-looking statements
about the matters described in this document or other matters concerning at&amp;t.;

         the   discussion  and  analysis  that  follows   provides   information
management  believes is relevant to an assessment  and  understanding  of at&amp;t;'s
consolidated  results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2000,  1999
and 1998, and financial condition as of december 31, 2000 and 1999.

consolidated results of operations

         the  comparison of 2000 results with 1999 was impacted by events,  such
as  acquisitions  and  dispositions  that occurred  during these two years.  for

<page>

example,  in  2000 we  acquired  mediaone  and  wireless  properties  in the san
francisco bay area, which were both included in our 2000 results for part of the
year,  but were not in 1999  results.  in 1999,  we acquired tci, the ibm global
network  (now at&amp;t;  global  network  services,  or agns) and  vanguard  cellular
systems,  inc. (vanguard).  these businesses were included in 2000 results for a
full  year,  but  only  a  part  of  1999  (since  their   respective  dates  of
acquisition).  further, we disposed of certain  international  businesses during
1999 and 2000.  the  results of  businesses  sold in 1999 were  included in 1999
results for part of the year, and were not in 2000 results. likewise, businesses
sold in 2000 were included in 1999 results for the full year and in 2000 results
for part of the year.

         year-over-year  comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of at
home   corp.    (excite@home)    beginning    september   1,   2000,    due   to
corporate-governance  changes  which gave at&amp;t; a controlling  interest.  at that
time and on december 31, 2000, we had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
74% voting interest in excite@home. prior to september 1, 2000, we accounted for
our ownership in excite@home under the equity method of accounting,  which means
our investment was included in "other  investments and related  advances" in the
1999  consolidated  balance  sheet and any earnings or losses were included as a
component  of "net losses from other  equity  investments"  in the  consolidated
statements of income. the consolidation of excite@home resulted in the inclusion
of 100% of its results in each line item of at&amp;t;'s  consolidated  balance  sheet
and consolidated income statement. the approximate 77% we do not own is shown in
the  2000  consolidated  balance  sheet  within  "minority  interest"  and  as a
component of  "minority  interest  income  (expense)"  in the 2000  consolidated
statement of income.

         on january 5, 2000, we launched concert,  our global joint venture with
british  telecommunications  plc (bt). at&amp;t; contributed all of its international
gateway-to-gateway   assets  and  the  economic  value  of   approximately   270
multinational  customers specifically targeted for direct sales by concert. as a
result,  2000  results do not include the revenue and expenses  associated  with
these  customers and  businesses,  while 1999 does, and 2000 results include our
proportionate  share of  concert's  earnings in "net  losses  from other  equity
investments."

         effective  july 1,  2000,  the  fcc  eliminated  primary  interexchange
carrier  charges (picc or per-line  charges) that at&amp;t; pays for  residential and
single-line  business  customers.  the  elimination  of these  per-line  charges
resulted  in lower  access  expense  as well as lower  revenue,  since  at&amp;t; has
historically billed its customers for these charges.

         the  comparison of 1999 results with 1998 was also impacted by the 1999
acquisitions  of tci,  agns and  vanguard,  since  1999  results  include  these
businesses  for part of the  year,  while  1998  does  not  include  them.  this
comparison  is  also  impacted  by  the  1999   dispositions  of   international
businesses,  which were included in 1999 results for part of the year,  but were
in 1998 results for the full year.

         total revenue  increased  5.4%, or $3.4 billion,  in 2000 compared with
the prior year. approximately $2.1 billion of the increase was due to the impact
of acquisitions and the  consolidation  of excite@home,  offset by the impact of
concert,  dispositions  and the  elimination of picc. the remaining $1.3 billion
increase was primarily  driven by a growing demand for our wireless and data and
internet protocol (ip) products,  and outsourcing services,  partially offset by
continued and  accelerating  declines in long distance voice revenue.  we expect
long  distance  revenue  to  continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  ongoing
competition and product substitution.

         total revenue in 1999 increased $9.4 billion,  or 17.6%,  compared with
1998.  nearly  three-quarters  of the increase was due to  acquisitions,  net of
dispositions.  the remaining increase was fueled by growth in wireless, business
data, business long distance voice and outsourcing revenue,  partially offset by
the continued decline of consumer long distance voice revenue.

         revenue by  segment  is  discussed  in  greater  detail in the  segment
results section.

         costs of  services  and  products  include the costs of  operating  and
maintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts,  fees paid
to other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network  roaming),
programming and licensing costs for cable services,  costs of wireless  handsets
sold,  the provision for  uncollectible  receivables  and other  service-related
costs.

         these costs  increased  $3.0 billion,  or 20.5%,  in 2000 compared with
1999. nearly $2.1 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impact
of  consolidating  excite@home,  net of the impact of concert and divestments of
international businesses.  the higher costs associated with our growing wireless
subscriber  base  and  wireless  network  as well as new  outsourcing  contracts
increased expenses by approximately  $1.5 billion.  the higher wireless expenses
primarily  related to higher costs of handsets  sold, due to a 53.5% increase in
gross subscriber  additions in 2000 compared with 1999.  expenses also increased
due to higher  video-programming  costs  principally due to rate increases,  and
higher  costs  associated  with new  broadband  services of  approximately  $0.3
billion.  these increases were partially offset by approximately $0.9 billion of
costs  savings from  continued  cost control  initiatives  and a higher  pension
credit in 2000, primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base, resulting
from increased investment returns.

         costs of services and products  rose $4.1  billion,  or 39.1%,  in 1999
compared with 1998,  primarily due to acquisitions,  net of dispositions,  which
accounted  for  approximately  $3.7  billion of the  increase.  the higher costs
associated with our growing wireless  subscriber base as well as new outsourcing
contracts increased expenses by approximately $1.5 billion. partially offsetting
the 1999 increases were network  cost-control  initiatives of approximately $0.4
billion,  and approximately  $0.3 billion of lower expenses in business services
related  to  per-call   compensation   expense,   provision  for   uncollectible
receivables and gross receipts and property taxes.

costs and decreased  per-line  charges  resulted in lower costs of approximately
$1.5  billion.  also  contributing  to the decrease was more  efficient  network
usage.  these decreases were partially offset by  approximately  $0.7 billion of
higher  costs due to volume  increases,  and $0.5  billion as a result of higher
universal  service fund  contributions.  since most of these  charges are passed
through  to  the  customer,  the  per-minute  access-rate  and  per-line  charge
reductions and the increased universal service fund contributions have generally
resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.

         costs paid to  telephone  companies  outside  of the  united  states to
connect  calls made to  countries  outside of the united  states  (international
settlements)  are also  included  within access and other  connection  expenses.
these  costs  decreased  approximately  $0.5  billion in 2000,  as result of the
commencement  of  operations  of  concert.   concert  now  incurs  most  of  our
international  settlements as well as earns most of our foreign-billed  revenue,
previously  incurred and earned  directly by at&amp;t.; in 2000,  concert billed us a
net expense composed of international settlement  (interconnection)  expense and
foreign-billed  revenue.  the  amount  charged by concert in 2000 was lower than
interconnection expense incurred in 1999, since at&amp;t; recorded these transactions
as revenue and expense,  as  applicable.  partially  offsetting the decline were
costs incurred related to concert products that at&amp;t; now sells to its customers.

         access and other connection expenses declined $0.6 billion, or 4.2%, in
1999  compared with the prior year.  this decline  resulted from $0.9 billion of
mandated  reductions  in  per-minute  access  rates in 1999 and  1998,  and $0.6
billion of lower international  settlement rates resulting from our negotiations
with  international  carriers.  additionally,  we continue to manage these costs
through more efficient network usage.  these reductions were partially offset by
$0.8 billion of higher costs due to volume growth,  and $0.3 billion as a result
of increased per-line charges and universal service fund contributions.

         selling,  general and  administrative  (sg&amp;a;)  expenses  decreased $0.2
billion, or 1.6%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  approximately $2.0 billion of the
decrease was due to savings from continued cost-control initiatives and a higher
pension credit in 2000,  primarily  driven by a higher pension trust asset base,
resulting from increased  investment  returns.  largely offsetting this decrease
was more than  $1.4  billion  of higher  expenses  associated  with our  growing
wireless  and  broadband  businesses,   and  nearly  $0.7  billion  of  expenses
associated with  acquisitions and the  consolidation of excite@home,  net of the
impact of concert and dispositions.
<page>

         sg&amp;a; expenses  increased  $0.7 billion,  or 5.8%, in 1999 compared with
1998.  this  increase was primarily due to  acquisitions,  net of  dispositions,
which  resulted in an increase in sg&amp;a; expenses of  approximately  $1.4 billion.
also contributing to the increase was approximately $0.4 billion of higher costs
to support our growing  wireless  subscriber  base.  partially  offsetting these
increases  were our continued  efforts to control costs on a companywide  basis,
which resulted in lower sg&amp;a; expenses of approximately  $0.9 billion,  including
lower spending for consumer long distance acquisition-programs.

<page>

         during 2000,  we recorded $7.0 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.90 earnings per diluted share impact to the
at&amp;t;  common  stock  group.  the 2000  charge  included  $6.2  billion  of asset
impairment  charges related to excite@home,  $759 million for  restructuring and
exit costs  associated with at&amp;t;'s  initiative to reduce costs,  and $91 million
related to the  government-mandated  disposition of at&amp;t;  communications  (u.k.)
ltd., which would have competed directly with concert.

         the asset impairment  charges related to excite@home  resulted from the
deterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of internet-related
companies  during  the fourth  quarter  of 2000,  which  caused  excite@home  to
conclude   that   intangible   assets   related   to   their   acquisitions   of
internet-related  companies  may not be  recoverable.  accordingly,  excite@home
conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
acquired  intangible  assets.  this assessment  resulted in a determination that
certain  acquired  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  related  to  these
acquisitions,  including  excite,  were  impaired as of december 31, 2000.  as a
result,  excite@home  recorded  impairment  charges of $4.6  billion in december
2000, representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over
their fair value.

         the  impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparison
of carrying values and fair values. the impairment  write-down within each asset
group was allocated  first to goodwill,  and if goodwill was reduced to zero, to
identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.

         since  we own  approximately  23%  of  excite@home,  77% of the  charge
recorded by  excite@home  was not  included as a reduction to at&amp;t;'s net income,
but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  consolidated  statement  of income as
"minority interest income (expense)."

         also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  at&amp;t;  recorded  a  goodwill  and
acquisition-related  impairment  charge  of $1.6  billion  associated  with  the
acquisition of our investment in  excite@home.  the write-down of our investment
to fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.

         the $759 million charge for  restructuring and exit plans was primarily
due to headcount reductions, mainly in network operations and business services,
including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
synergies created by the mediaone merger.

         included in exit costs was $503  million of cash  termination  benefits
associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of
voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  approximately  one-half of the
separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
approximately   6,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
terminations and approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.

         we also  recorded  $62  million  of  network  lease and other  contract
termination  costs  associated  with  penalties  incurred  as part of  notifying
vendors of the termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of
$32 million related to the disposition of facilities  primarily due to synergies
created by the mediaone merger.

         also included in restructuring  and exit costs in 2000 was $144 million
of benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part
of these exit plans.  further,  we recorded  an asset  impairment  charge of $18
million related to the write-down of unrecoverable  assets in certain businesses
where the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.
<page>

         the 2000 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
of  approximately  $690  million  per  year,  as well as ebit  (earnings  before
interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax losses
from other equity  investments)  savings of approximately $700 million per year.
we expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cash
and  ebit  savings.  the  ebit  savings,   primarily   attributable  to  reduced
personnel-related  expenses,  will be  realized  in sg&amp;a;  expenses  and costs of
services and products.

         during 1999,  we recorded $1.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.37 earnings per diluted share impact to the
at&amp;t; common stock group.

         a $594 million in-process  research and development charge was recorded
reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at tci,
as of the  date of the  acquisition,  which  had not yet  reached  technological
feasibility or had no alternative future use. the projects identified related to
efforts to offer voice over ip, product-integration efforts for advanced set-top
devices,  cost-savings  efforts  for  broadband-telephony   implementation,  and
in-process  research and development  related to  excite@home.  we estimated the
fair value of  in-process  research and  development  for each project  using an
income  approach,  which  was  adjusted  to  allocate  fair  value  based on the
project's  percentage of completion.  under this approach,  the present value of
the anticipated  future benefits of the projects was determined using a discount
rate of 17%. for each project, the resulting net present value was multiplied by
a percentage of  completion  based on effort  expended to date versus  projected
costs to complete.

         the charge associated with voice-over-ip technology, which allows voice
telephony  traffic to be digitized and transmitted in ip data packets,  was $225
million as of the date of acquisition.  current voice-over-ip equipment does not
yet support many of the features required to connect customer premises equipment
to traditional phone networks.  further technical  development is also needed to
ensure  voice  quality  that  is  comparable  to  conventional  circuit-switched
telephony and to reduce the power consumption of the ip-telephony  equipment. we
started  testing  ip-telephony  equipment  in the  field in  late-2000  and will
continue tests throughout 2001.

         the charge  associated  with  product-integration  efforts for advanced
set-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,
was $114 million as of the acquisition date. the associated  technology consists
of the development  and  integration  work needed to provide a suite of software
tools to run on the digital  set-top box hardware  platform.  it is  anticipated
that field trials will begin in late-2001 for next-generation digital services.

         the charge associated with cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephony
implementation  was $101 million as of the date of  acquisition.  telephony cost
reductions  primarily consist of cost savings from the development of a "line of
power  switch," which allows us to cost  effectively  provide power for customer
telephony  equipment  through  the cable  plant.  this  device  will allow us to
provide  line-powered  telephony  without  burying the cable line to each house.
trials related to our telephony cost reductions are complete, and implementation
has begun in certain markets.

         additionally, the in-process research and development charge related to
excite@home was valued at $154 million. this charge related to projects to allow
for  self-provisioning of devices and the development of next-generation  client
software,  network and back-office infrastructure to enable a variety of network
devices  beyond  personal  computers  and improved  design for the regional data
centers' infrastructure.
<page>

         although  there are  technological  issues to overcome to  successfully
complete the acquired in-process research and development,  we expect successful
completion.  we estimate the costs to complete the identified  projects will not
have a material impact on our results of operations.  if, however, we are unable
to  establish   technological   feasibility  and  produce   commercially  viable
products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.

         a $531 million asset impairment  charge was recorded in 1999 associated
with the planned disposal of certain wireless communications equipment resulting
from a program to increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our wireless
network.  as part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
equipment in the western  united states and the  metropolitan  new york markets.
the program is intended to provide wireless  services with the newest technology
available  and allow us to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities. since the assets will
remain in service  from the date of the  decision to dispose of these  assets to
the  disposal  date,  the  remaining  net  book  value  of the  assets  will  be
depreciated over this period.

         also in 1999, a $145 million  charge for  restructuring  and exit costs
was recorded as part of at&amp;t;'s initiative to reduce costs. the restructuring and
exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
reductions  in  business   services  and  network   operations,   including  the
consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

         included in exit costs was $142  million of cash  termination  benefits
associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of
voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  approximately  one-half of the
separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
approximately   1,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
terminations and approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.

         the 1999 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
of approximately $250 million per year. this restructuring  yielded ebit savings
of  approximately  $200  million in 2000,  and is  expected  to save nearly $400
million per year thereafter.  we expect increased  spending in growth businesses
will largely  offset these cash and ebit savings.  the ebit  savings,  primarily
attributable  to reduced  personnel-related  expenses,  will be realized in sg&amp;a;
expenses and costs of services and products.

         we  also   recorded  net  losses  of  $307   million   related  to  the
government-mandated  disposition of certain international  businesses that would
have competed  directly with concert,  and $50 million related to a contribution
agreement broadband entered into with phoenixstar,  inc. that agreement requires
broadband  to  satisfy   certain   liabilities   owed  by  phoenixstar  and  its
subsidiaries.  the remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and an
agreement  that  mediaone  had is $57  million,  which was fully  accrued for at
december 31, 2000. in addition,  we recorded benefits of $121 million related to
the settlement of pension  obligations for former  employees who accepted at&amp;t;'s
1998 voluntary retirement incentive program (vrip) offer.

         during 1998,  we recorded $2.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.59 earnings per diluted share impact to the
at&amp;t; common stock group.  the bulk of the charge was associated with our overall
cost-reduction  program and the approximately  15,300  management  employees who
accepted the vrip offer. a  restructuring  charge of $2,724 million was composed

<page>

of  $2,254   million  and  $169   million   for   pension   and   postretirement
special-termination  benefits,   respectively,  $263  million  of  benefit  plan
curtailment  losses  and $38  million  of other  administrative  costs.  we also
recorded charges of $125 million for related facility costs and $150 million for
executive-separation  costs.  these charges were partially offset by benefits of
$940 million as we settled pension  benefit  obligations for 13,700 of the total
vrip  employees.  in addition,  the vrip charges  were  partially  offset by the
reversal  of $256  million of 1995  business  restructuring  reserves  primarily
resulting from the overlap of vrip on certain 1995 projects.

         also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718  million,  of which $633  million was
related  to  our  decision  not  to  pursue  total  service  resale  (tsr)  as a
local-service  strategy. we also recorded an $85 million asset impairment charge
related to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  international
operations  where the  carrying  value was no longer  supported  by future  cash
flows. this charge was made in connection with the review of certain  operations
that would have competed directly with concert.

         additionally,  $85 million of merger-related  expenses were recorded in
1998 in connection  with the teleport  communications  group inc.  (tcg) merger,
which was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  partially  offsetting  these
charges  was a $92  million  reversal of the 1995  restructuring  reserve.  this
reversal reflected  reserves no longer deemed necessary.  the reversal primarily
included  separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower than
originally   anticipated.   consistent  with  the  three-year   plan,  the  1995
restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 1998.

         operating  income  decreased $6.6 billion,  or 60.6%,  in 2000 compared
with 1999. the decrease was primarily due to higher net  restructuring and other
charges of $5.5 billion. also contributing to the decrease was the impact of the
acquisition  of mediaone and the  consolidation  of  excite@home,  which lowered
operating  income by $1.5 billion.  a majority of the impact of operating losses
and the  restructuring  charge  generated by excite@home  was offset in minority
interest income  (expense),  reflecting the approximate 77% of excite@home we do
not own. partially offsetting these decreases were cost-control  initiatives and
a larger pension credit associated with our mature long distance  businesses and
related support groups, partially offset by lower long distance revenue.

         operating  income rose $3.4  billion,  or 45.0%,  in 1999 compared with
1998. the increase was driven by approximately  $2.3 billion of operating income
improvements in business services and consumer  services,  reflecting  operating
expense  efficiencies.  also  contributing  to the  increase was $1.0 billion of
lower net restructuring and other charges.

         other income  increased $0.6 billion,  or 62.4%,  in 2000 compared with
1999.  this  increase  was  primarily  due to  greater  net  gains  on  sales of
businesses  and   investments  of   approximately   $1.0  billion,   and  higher
investment-related  income of  approximately  $0.3 billion.  the higher gains on
sales  were  driven  by  significant  gains  associated  with  the swap of cable
properties  with comcast  corporation  (comcast)  and cox  communications,  inc.
(cox), the sale of our investment in lenfest communications,  inc. (lenfest) and
celumovil,  and a gain  recorded as a result of the merger of telecorp pcs, inc.
(telecorp)  and tritel,  inc.  (tritel)  and related  transactions.  these gains
aggregated  approximately $1.0 billion and had an approximate $0.29 earnings per
diluted  share  impact to the at&amp;t;  common  stock  group.  in 1999,  we recorded
significant  gains  associated  with  the  sale of our  language  line  services
business,  a portion of our  ownership  interest  in at&amp;t;  canada as well as our
investment in wood-tv. these gains aggregated approximately $0.4 billion and had
an approximate  $0.07 earnings per diluted share impact to the at&amp;t; common stock
group.  offsetting the increases to other income in 2000 was an approximate $0.5
billion charge  reflecting the increase in the fair value of put options held by
comcast and cox related to excite@home  stock, and approximately $0.2 billion of
higher investment impairment charges.

         other income  decreased $0.4 billion,  or 27.3%,  in 1999 compared with
1998.  the  decrease  was due to lower  net  gains on  sales of  businesses  and
investments of  approximately  $0.3 billion as well as lower  investment-related
income of approximately  $0.2 billion.  in 1999, we recorded  significant  gains
associated  with the sale of our language line services  business,  a portion of
our  ownership  interest  in at&amp;t; canada as well as our  investment  in wood-tv.
these gains aggregated  approximately  $0.4 billion and had an approximate $0.07
earnings per diluted  share impact to the at&amp;t; common stock group.  in 1998,  we
recorded  significant gains associated with the sale of at&amp;t; solutions  customer
care, lin television  corp. and smartone  telecommunications  holdings  limited.
these gains aggregated  approximately  $0.8 billion and had an approximate $0.18
earnings per diluted share impact to the at&amp;t; common stock group.

         interest  expense  increased  80.3%, or $1.4 billion,  in 2000 compared
with 1999.  the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance as a
result of our june 2000 acquisition of mediaone,  including  outstanding debt of
mediaone  and debt issued to fund the mediaone  acquisition,  and our march 1999
acquisition of tci, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.

         interest expense increased $1.3 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, due
to a higher average debt balance  associated  with our  acquisitions,  including
debt outstanding of tci at the date of acquisition.

         the  effective  income tax rate is the  provision for income taxes as a
percent of income from continuing  operations before income taxes. the effective
income  tax rate was 128.1% in 2000,  36.9% in 1999 and 36.6% in 1998.  in 2000,
the effective tax rate was negatively  impacted by excite@home,  which is unable
to record tax benefits  associated  with its pretax  losses.  therefore the $4.6
billion restructuring charges taken by excite@home in 2000 had no associated tax
benefit.  the 2000 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax-free gain
resulting  from an exchange  of at&amp;t; stock for an entity  owning  certain  cable
systems  and other  assets  with cox and the  benefit  of the  write-off  of the
related  deferred tax  liability.  the 1999  effective  tax rate was  negatively
impacted by a non-tax-deductible research and development charge, but positively
impacted  by a change in the net  operating  loss  utilization  tax  rules  that
resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance and the income tax provision.

         minority  interest  income  (expense),  which is recorded net of income
taxes,  represents  an adjustment to at&amp;t;'s income to reflect the less than 100%
ownership of  consolidated  subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
issued by subsidiaries of at&amp;t.; the $4.2 billion  increase in minority  interest
in 2000 resulted from the  consolidation of excite@home  effective  september 1,
2000. the minority  interest income in 2000 primarily  reflects losses generated
by excite@home, including the goodwill impairment charge, that were attributable
to the  approximate  77% of  excite@home  not  owned by at&amp;t.;  the  decrease  in
minority  interest in 1999  compared with 1998 was primarily due to dividends on

         equity earnings from lmg, which are recorded net of income taxes,  were
$1.5 billion in 2000, compared with losses of $2.0 billion in 1999. the increase
was primarily due to gains on dispositions,  including gains associated with the
mergers of various  companies that lmg had  investments  in. gains were recorded
for the difference  between the carrying value of lmg's interest in the acquired
company and the fair value of  securities  received in the merger.  in addition,
lower stock  compensation  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 contributed to the
increase.  these were partially  offset by impairment  charges recorded on lmg's

         net losses from other  equity  investments,  which are  recorded net of
income taxes, were $0.2 billion in 2000, a 73.2% improvement compared with 1999.
this  improvement  was primarily a result of the redemption of our investment in
ab cellular which resulted in the distribution of wireless properties in the los
angeles  area  to  at&amp;t;,  which  caused  ab  cellular  to  record  a gain on the
distribution. our pro rata share of this gain was approximately $0.4 billion. in
addition,  in 2000,  earnings from our investment in  cablevision  systems corp.
(cablevision) were approximately $0.2 billion higher than 1999 due to gains from
cable-system  sales.  offsetting  these  increases were losses from our stake in
time warner  entertainment  company,  l.p. (twe) which we acquired in connection
with the  mediaone  merger and greater  equity  losses from  excite@home,  which
aggregated approximately $0.1 billion.

         net losses from equity  investments  were $0.8 billion in 1999 compared
with $78 million in 1998,  primarily due to losses we recorded on investments we
acquired through tci, largely cablevision and excite@home.

decrease was primarily due to higher  restructuring and asset impairment charges

losses of mediaone and additional  interest  expense.  also  contributing to the
decrease was the impact of excite@home,  including the mark-to-market adjustment
related to the put options held by comcast and cox. these were partially  offset
by lower  losses  from  equity  investments  and an  increase  in other  income,
primarily   associated  with  higher  net  gains  on  sales  of  businesses  and
investments, and higher investment-related income. also impacting eps was higher
operating income associated with our mature long distance businesses.

group on a diluted basis declined  10.3% in 1999, to $1.74,  compared with 1998.
the decline was  primarily  due to the impact of the tci and agns  acquisitions,
including  the  impact of shares  issued and equity  losses of  excite@home  and
cablevision.  partially offsetting these declines were increased income from the

discontinued operations

         pursuant to accounting  principles  board opinion no. 30 "reporting the
results  of  operations--reporting  the  effects of  disposal  of a segment of a
business,  and  extraordinary,  unusual and  infrequently  occurring  events and
transactions,"  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  at&amp;t;  reflect  the
disposition of at&amp;t; universal  card services  (ucs),  which was sold on april 2,
1998, as discontinued operations.  accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses,
and cash flows of ucs have been  excluded  from the  respective  captions in the
1998 consolidated  statement of income and consolidated statement of cash flows,
and have been reported  through the april 2, 1998 date of disposition as "income
from discontinued  operations," net of applicable income taxes; and as "net cash
provided by discontinued  operations."  the gain associated with the sale of ucs
is  recorded as "gain on sale of  discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable
income taxes.

extraordinary items

         in august 1998, at&amp;t; extinguished  approximately  $1.0 billion of tcg's
debt.  the $217  million  pretax  loss on the early  extinguishment  of debt was
recorded as an  extraordinary  loss. the after-tax  impact was $137 million,  or
$0.05 per diluted share.

segment results

         in support of the services we provided in 2000,  we segment our results
by the  business  units that  support our primary  lines of  business:  business
services,  consumer  services,  wireless services and broadband.  the balance of
at&amp;t;'s operations, excluding lmg, is included in a corporate and other category.
although not a segment, we also discuss the results of lmg.

         the  discussion of segment  results  includes  revenue;  ebit (earnings
before interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax
losses  of  other  equity   investments);   ebitda   (ebit  plus   depreciation,
amortization  and minority  interest income  (expense) other than  excite@home);
total  assets,  and capital  additions.  the  discussion  of ebitda for wireless
services and  broadband is modified to exclude  other income and net losses from
equity investments.  total assets for each segment generally include all assets,
except intercompany receivables. however, our wireless services segment included
intercompany  receivables  from at&amp;t; and the related interest income since these
assets  relate to the  results  of the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracked  business.
prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
held at the  corporate  level,  and  therefore are included in the corporate and
other group. shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocated
each january, based on two years of volumes.  capital additions for each segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,  acquisitions of
licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
and additions to internal-use software.
<page>

         ebit is the primary  measure  used by at&amp;t;'s chief  operating  decision
makers to measure at&amp;t;'s operating results and to measure segment  profitability
and performance. at&amp;t; calculates ebit as operating income plus net pretax losses
from equity  investments,  pretax minority  interest income  (expense) and other
income.  in  addition,  management  also uses  ebitda as a  measure  of  segment
profitability  and  performance,  and is  defined  as ebit,  excluding  minority
interest  income  (expense)  other  than  excite@home,   plus  depreciation  and
amortization. interest and taxes are not factored into the segment profitability
measure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for these
items  are  discussed  on a  consolidated  basis.  management  believes  ebit is
meaningful to investors  because it provides analysis of operating results using
the same measures used by at&amp;t;'s chief operating  decision makers and provides a
return on total  capitalization  measure.  we believe  ebitda is  meaningful  to
investors as a measure of each segment's  liquidity  consistent with the measure
utilized by our chief operating  decision makers.  in addition,  we believe that
both ebit and ebitda allow  investors a means to evaluate the financial  results
of each segment in relation to total at&amp;t.; ebit for at&amp;t; was $9.4 billion, $10.5
billion and $8.7 billion for the years ended  december 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively. ebitda for at&amp;t; was $19.8 billion, $18.6 billion and $13.4 billion
for the  years  ended  december  31,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  our
calculation of ebit and ebitda may or may not be consistent with the calculation
of these  measures  by other  public  companies.  ebit and ebitda  should not be
viewed  by  investors  as  an  alternative  to  generally  accepted   accounting
principles  (gaap)  measures  of income as a measure of  performance  or to cash
flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
liquidity.  in addition,  ebitda does not take into  account  changes in certain
assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.

         reflecting  the dynamics of our  business,  we  continually  review our
management model and structure and make adjustments accordingly.

revenue

         in 2000, business services revenue grew $1.0 billion, or 3.7%, compared
with 1999.  approximately  $0.4 billion of the increase was due to the impact of
acquisitions, partially offset by the formation of concert. strength in data and
ip  services  as well as growth in our  outsourcing  business  contributed  $1.8
billion to the increase. this growth, however, was offset by an approximate $0.9
billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricing
pressures in the industry.

         revenue in 1999 grew $3.2 billion,  or 13.2%.  the  acquisition of agns
contributed  approximately $1.1 billion to the growth.  data, ip and outsourcing
services grew  approximately $1.5 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, while long
distance  voice  services  and local  services  contributed  approximately  $0.6
billion to the revenue increase.

         data services,  which represent the transportation of data, rather than
voice,  along our network,  was impacted by  acquisitions  and the  formation of
concert.  excluding these impacts, data services grew at a high-teens percentage
rate in 2000. growth was led by the continued  strength of frame relay services;
ip services,  which include ip-connectivity services and virtual private network
(vpn) services; and high-speed  private-line  services.  excluding the impact of
agns,  data  services  grew at a  high-teens  percentage  rate in  1999,  led by
strength in frame relay and high-speed private-line services.

         at&amp;t;  solutions  outsourcing  revenue  grew 47.9% in 2000 and 146.0% in
1999.  more than one-half of the 2000 growth and  approximately  65% of the 1999
growth was driven by our acquisition of agns. the remaining growth in both years
was primarily due to growth from new contract  signings and add-on business from
existing clients.

         excluding the impact of concert,  long distance voice services  revenue
declined  at a mid  single-digit  percentage  rate  in 2000  due to a  declining
average price per minute  reflecting the competitive  forces within the industry
which are expected to  continue.  partially  offsetting  this decline was a high
single-digit  percentage  growth rate in minutes.  in 1999,  long distance voice
revenue  grew  at a low  single-digit  percentage  rate,  as  volumes  grew at a
high-teens percentage rate, which was largely offset by a declining average rate
per minute.

         local voice services  revenue grew nearly 20% in 2000 and more than 50%
in 1999.  during 2000, at&amp;t; added more than 867,000 access lines, with the total
reaching nearly 2.3 million at the end of the year. during 1999, at&amp;t; added more
than 719,000 access lines.  access lines enable at&amp;t; to provide local service to
customers by allowing  direct  connection  from  customer  equipment to the at&amp;t;
network.  at&amp;t; serves more than 6,000 buildings on-network (buildings where at&amp;t;

approximately  3.5% over 1999.  at the end of 1999,  at&amp;t; served just over 5,800
buildings  on-network  compared with approximately 5,200 buildings at the end of
1998.

         business services  internal revenue increased $66 million,  or 9.1%, in
2000 and $253 million, or 52.8%, in 1999. the increase in 2000 was the result of
greater sales of business long distance services to other at&amp;t; units that resell
such  services to their  external  customers,  primarily  broadband and wireless
services.  the  increase  in 2000 was  partially  offset by a  decline  in sales
related to international  businesses divested. in 1999, the increase in internal
revenue was primarily due to greater sales of long distance services to wireless
services.

ebit/ebitda

         ebit improved $0.4 billion,  or 6.7%, and ebitda improved $0.8 billion,
or 8.1%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  this  improvement  reflects an increase in
revenue  and lower  costs as a result  of our  continued  cost-control  efforts,
partially  offset by the  formation  of  concert  and the  acquisition  of agns.
additionally,  the  ebit  increase  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in
depreciation and  amortization  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 primarily due
to a higher network asset base.

         in 1999, ebit improved $1.1 billion, or 22.9%, and ebitda improved $1.9
billion,  or 25.7%,  compared with 1998.  these increases were driven by revenue
growth  combined with margin  improvement  resulting  from ongoing  cost-control
initiatives.  the increase in ebit was offset somewhat by increased depreciation
and amortization expenses resulting from increased capital expenditures aimed at
data, ip and local services.

other items

         capital  additions  decreased  $1.3 billion in 2000, and increased $1.4
billion in 1999.  in 2000,  the decrease was a result of lower  spending for our
long distance  network  (including the data network).  in 1999, the increase was
primarily  due to  additional  spending for the build out of our local  services
sonet transport network.

         total assets  increased  $2.8  billion,  or 8.7%, at december 31, 2000,
compared with december 31, 1999. the increase was primarily due to net increases
in property,  plant and equipment as a result of capital additions, and a higher
accounts receivable balance.

consumer services

         our consumer  services  segment provides  residential  customers with a
variety of any-distance communications services,  including long distance, local
toll (intrastate calls outside the immediate local area) and internet access. in
addition,  consumer  services  provides  transaction  services,  such as prepaid
calling card and operator-handled  calling services. local phone service is also
provided in certain areas.

revenue

         consumer  services  revenue  declined 13.2%,  or $2.9 billion,  in 2000
compared  with 1999.  approximately  $0.9  billion of the decline was due to the
elimination of per-line charges in 2000 and the impact of concert. the remainder
of the decline was primarily  due to a decline in  traditional  voice  services,
such as  domestic  dial 1,  reflecting  the  ongoing  competitive  nature of the
consumer long distance  industry,  which has resulted in pricing pressures and a
loss of market share. also negatively impacting revenue was product substitution
and  market   migration  away  from  direct-dial   wireline  and   higher-priced
calling-card  services to the rapidly growing wireless services and lower-priced
prepaid-card   services.  as  a  result,  calling  volumes  declined  at  a  mid
single-digit  percentage  rate  in  2000.  we  expect  competition  and  product
substitution to continue to negatively impact consumer services revenue.

         in august 1999, we introduced at&amp;t; one rate,  which allows customers to
make long distance  calls, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the same rate.
these one rate offers  continue to be well received in the market with more than
12 million customers enrolled since the plan's introduction.  in addition,  at&amp;t;
has been  successful  in  packaging  services in the  consumer  market by giving
customers  the option of intralata  service with its one rate offers.  more than
60% of the  customers  enrolled in one rate have chosen at&amp;t; as their  intralata
provider.

         at&amp;t;'s any distance new york local one rate offer,  which combines both
local and long distance service, has experienced high customer acceptance.  at&amp;t;
ended the year with nearly 760,000 customers under this plan.

         in 1999,  consumer services revenue decreased $1.0 billion, or 4.5%, on
a mid single-digit  percentage decline in volumes. the 1999 decline reflects the
ongoing  competitive nature of the consumer long distance  industry,  as well as
product   substitution   and  market   migration   away  from  direct  dial  and
higher-priced  calling-card  services to rapidly growing  wireless  services and
lower-priced prepaid-card services.

ebit/ebitda

         ebit declined $0.8 billion, or 10.4%, and ebitda declined $1.0 billion,
or 12.0%, in 2000 compared with 1999. the declines in ebit and ebitda  primarily
reflect  the  decline  in  the  long  distance  business,   offset  somewhat  by
cost-control  initiatives.  in addition,  the  declines  reflect $0.2 billion of
lower gains on sales of  businesses,  primarily  the 1999 sale of language  line
services,  and  higher  restructuring   charges.   reflecting  our  cost-control
initiatives,  ebit and  ebitda  margins  in 2000  improved  to 37.4% and  40.3%,
respectively, compared with 36.2% and 39.8%, respectively, in 1999.

         ebit grew $1.3  billion,  or 20.4%,  and ebitda grew $1.4  billion,  or
19.7%, in 1999. the ebit margin improved to 36.2% in 1999 (excluding the gain on
the sale of language line  services,  the 1999 ebit margin was 35.5%) from 28.7%
in the  prior  year.  the ebit and  ebitda  growth  for  1999  reflects  ongoing
cost-reduction  efforts,  particularly in marketing  spending,  as well as lower
negotiated international settlement rates.

other items

         capital additions decreased $0.4 billion, or 54.0%, in 2000 as a result
of a planned  reduction in spending on the voice network and reduced spending on
internal-use  software as most of the  functionality  upgrades were completed in

<page>

1999. in 1999, capital additions increased $0.2 billion, or 42.9%, primarily due
to increased spending on internal-use  software to add more functionality to our
services and in support of at&amp;t; worldnet services subscriber growth.

         total assets declined $1.5 billion,  or 23.5%, during 2000. the decline
was primarily due to assets transferred to concert during 2000, as well as lower
accounts receivable, reflecting lower revenue.

revenue

         wireless  services  revenue grew $2.8 billion,  or 37.0%,  in 2000, and
$2.2 billion,  or 41.1%, in 1999.  approximately $0.6 billion of the 2000 growth
was due to acquisitions,  and approximately  $0.2 billion of the 1999 growth was
due to the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions.  the remaining increases
were due to subscriber growth,  reflecting the continued successful execution of
at&amp;t;'s wireless strategy of targeting and retaining  specific customer segments,
expanding the national  wireless  footprint,  focusing on digital  service,  and
offering simple rate plans. in addition,  an increase in average monthly revenue
per user (arpu) contributed to the growth.

         consolidated  subscribers grew 58.5% during 2000 to approximately  15.2
million,  and grew  33.4% to  approximately  9.6  million in 1999.  this  growth
included  approximately 3.0 million  subscribers from acquisitions closed during

<page>

2000, and approximately  900,000 from acquisitions  closed during 1999. arpu was
$68.20 for 2000, a 3.6% increase  compared with 1999. arpu in 1999 was $65.80, a
14.2% increase from 1998. the average monthly  subscriber churn rate in 2000 was
2.9% compared with 2.6% in 1999.  average  monthly  subscriber  churn  increased
during  2000 as a result of  competitive  pressures,  as well as our  efforts to
expand to a broader base of consumer  segments  served (e.g.,  prepaid  wireless
services).  we expect these factors to continue,  which will result in a decline
in arpu.

ebit/ebitda

         in 2000,  ebit  improved $1.6 billion from a deficit of $0.5 billion in
1999.  approximately  one-half  of the  improvement  was  due to  higher  pretax
earnings on equity  investments  and greater  gains on sales of  businesses  and
investments.  these items included higher equity earnings due to a gain recorded
relating to the redemption of our  investment in ab cellular,  as well as a gain
on  transactions  associated  with our  affiliate  investments  in telecorp  and
tritel, and a gain on the sale of celumovil in 2000. in 1999, we recorded a gain
on the sale of wood-tv.  also positively impacting the ebit growth in 2000 was a
1999 asset impairment  charge of $0.5 billion and higher  intercompany  interest
income in 2000  resulting  from the at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking stock offering
proceeds  attributed  to wireless  services.  the  remaining  ebit  increase was
primarily due to increased  revenue,  partially  offset by a related increase in
expenses.

         in 1999, ebit declined $0.9 billion from $0.4 billion in 1998. the ebit
decline was primarily due to the 1999 asset  impairment  charge of approximately
$0.5  billion  and  lower  gains on  sales  of  businesses  and  investments  of
approximately $0.5 billion.

         ebitda,  which excludes net earnings  (losses) from equity  investments
and other income, increased $1.1 billion in 2000 to $1.7 billion.  approximately
one-half of the increase was due to the 1999 impairment charge and the remainder
was  due to  increased  revenue,  partially  offset  by a  related  increase  in
expenses.

         in 1999,  ebitda,  which  excludes  net earnings  (losses)  from equity
investments and other income, declined $0.3 billion to $0.6 billion. the decline
was primarily due to the 1999 asset  impairment  charge,  partially offset by an
increase in revenue net of related expenses.

other items

         capital  additions  increased  $2.8 billion in 2000, and increased $0.3
billion in 1999.  spending in both years focused on increasing  the capacity and
quality of our national wireless network.

         total assets were $35.2 billion as of december 31, 2000, an increase of
$11.8  billion,  or 50.3%,  compared  with  december 31, 1999.  the increase was
primarily due to increases in licensing costs, goodwill, and property, plant and
equipment  associated  with the  acquisitions  that closed in 2000. in addition,
property,  plant and  equipment  increased  as a result of  significant  capital
expenditures  in 2000.  these  increases were partially  offset by a decrease in
investments,  as wireless services  previously held equity interests in portions
of wireless  properties in the san francisco bay area and los angeles through ab
cellular. these markets were consolidated as of december 31, 2000.

revenue

         broadband  revenue grew $3.1 billion in 2000,  or 62.1%,  compared with
1999.  approximately  $2.8  billion of the  increase  in revenue  was due to the
acquisition  of mediaone in 2000 and tci in 1999. in addition,  revenue from new
services  (digital  video,  high-speed  data,  and  broadband  telephony)  and a
basic-cable rate increase contributed  approximately $0.4 billion to the revenue
increase.

         at december 31, 2000,  broadband  serviced  approximately  16.0 million
basic-cable  customers,  passing approximately 28.3 million homes, compared with
11.4 million basic-cable customers,  passing approximately 19.7 million homes at
december  31, 1999.  the  increase  reflects  the  acquisition  of mediaone.  at
december  31, 2000,  we provided  digital  video  service to  approximately  2.8
million  customers,   high-speed  data  service  to  approximately  1.1  million
customers,  and broadband telephony service to approximately  547,000 customers.
this  compares  with   approximately   1.8  million   digital-video   customers,
approximately  207,000  high-speed  data  customers,  and nearly 8,300 broadband
telephony customers at the end of 1999.

ebit/ebitda

         ebit in 2000 was a deficit  of $1.2  billion,  an  improvement  of $0.3
billion,  or 20.4%.  this improvement was due to  approximately  $0.5 billion of
higher gains on sales of businesses and investments, primarily gains on the swap

<page>

of cable  properties  with cox and  comcast  and the sale of our  investment  in
lenfest, and $0.4 billion lower restructuring  charges primarily associated with
an in-process  research and  development  charge recorded in connection with the
1999 acquisition of tci. also  contributing to the improvement were lower pretax
losses from equity  investments  of $0.5 billion,  due in part to a $0.3 billion
improvement  from our investment in cablevision  due to gains from  cable-system
sales.  these  improvements were largely offset by the impact of the acquisition
of mediaone as well as tci of  approximately  $0.5  billion and higher  expenses
associated   with   high-speed   data  and  broadband   telephony   services  of
approximately $0.4 billion.

         ebitda,  which  excludes net losses from equity  investments  and other
income,  was $1.7 billion in 2000, an improvement of $0.9 billion  compared with
1999.  this  improvement  was  due  to  the  impact  of  the  mediaone  and  tci
acquisitions  of $0.7 billion and lower  restructuring  charges of $0.4 billion.
higher  expenses  associated  with  high-speed  data and broadband  telephony of
approximately $0.2 billion offset these increases.

other items

         capital additions increased 4.3% to approximately $5.0 billion in 2000,
from $4.8 billion in 1999. the increase was due to higher  capital  expenditures
of $0.8 billion  primarily due to mediaone,  which was almost entirely offset by
decreased contributions to various nonconsolidated  investments of $0.7 billion.
in 1999,  spending  was  largely  directed  toward  cable-distribution  systems,
focusing on the upgrade of cable plant-assets,  as well as equity infusions into
various investments.

         total assets at december 31, 2000,  were $114.7  billion  compared with
$53.8  billion at december 31, 1999.  the increase in total assets was primarily
due to the mediaone acquisition and an increase in property, plant and equipment
as a  result  of  capital  expenditures,  net  of  depreciation  expense.  these
increases were partially offset by a decrease in the mark-to-market valuation of
certain investments.

revenue

         revenue for corporate and other  primarily  includes the elimination of
intercompany  revenue of negative $0.8 billion (an increase of $0.1 billion from
1999),  revenue  from  excite@home  of  $0.2  billion  (which  was  consolidated

and  ventures  of $0.3  billion (a  decline  of $0.9  billion  from  1999).  the

revenue impact of businesses contributed to concert and due to the impact of the
divestment of certain businesses.

         for 1999,  revenue  decreased $0.1 billion,  or 12.0%.  the decline was
driven by an increase in the elimination of intercompany revenue and the sale of
at&amp;t;  solutions  customer  care  (ascc) in 1998,  partially  offset by growth in
international operations and ventures.

ebit/ebitda

         ebit and  ebitda  deficits  in 2000  increased  $2.5  billion  and $2.3
billion to $4.2 billion and $3.2  billion,  respectively.  the  increases in the
deficits were largely related to excite@home.  in 2000,  restructuring and other
charges,  net of minority  interest,  were $2.8 billion higher  primarily due to
goodwill  impairment  charges  recorded  by  excite@home  and  at&amp;t;  related  to
excite@home.  other impacts included a charge of approximately  $0.5 billion for
the fair market value increase of put options held by comcast and cox related to
excite@home,  and operating losses from excite@home.  partially offsetting these
declines  were an increase in the pension  credit due to a higher  pension trust
asset base  resulting  from  increased  investment  returns,  and lower expenses
associated  with  our  continued  efforts  to  reduce  costs,  which  aggregated
approximately  $1.0  billion.  in  addition,   higher  net  gains  on  sales  of
investments  and an  increase in interest  income  increased  ebit and ebitda by
approximately $0.6 billion.

         in 1999,  ebit and ebitda  deficits  improved by $1.6  billion and $2.0
billion to $1.6 billion and $0.9 billion,  respectively.  the improvements  were
driven by $2.1  billion  of lower net  restructuring  and other  charges in 1999
compared with 1998,  partially  offset by lower gains on the sales of businesses
and lower interest  income,  which  negatively  impacted ebit and ebitda by $0.3
billion.  additionally,  ebit was  impacted  by  dividends  on  trust  preferred
securities. in 1998, at&amp;t; recorded a gain on the sale of ascc.

other items

         capital  additions  increased  $0.7  billion in 2000.  the increase was
driven by our  investment  in 2000 in  net2phone,  inc.  (net2phone),  partially
offset  by lower  investments  in  international  nonconsolidated  subsidiaries.
capital   additions   increased  $0.9  billion  in  1999  reflecting   increased
international equity investments that support our global strategy.

         total assets increased $2.9 billion at december 31, 2000, primarily due
to our investments in concert and net2phone.

liberty media group

         lmg produces,  acquires and distributes entertainment,  educational and
informational  programming services through all available formats and media. lmg
is also engaged in  electronic-retailing  services,  direct-marketing  services,

<page>

processing.  earnings from lmg were $1.5 billion in 2000 compared with losses of
$2.0  billion  from the date of  acquisition  through  december  31,  1999.  the
increase was primarily due to gains on dispositions,  including gains associated
with the mergers of various  companies that lmg had  investments  in. gains were
recorded for the difference  between the carrying value of lmg's interest in the
acquired  company and the fair value of  securities  received in the merger.  in
addition,   lower  stock  compensation   expense  in  2000  compared  with  1999
contributed to the increase.  these were partially offset by impairment  charges
recorded on lmg's investments to reflect other than temporary  declines in value
and higher losses relating to lmg's equity affiliates.

         in 2000,  net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of  continuing
operations  increased  $1.8  billion.  the increase was  primarily  driven by an
increase  in net  income  excluding  the  noncash  impact  of  depreciation  and
amortization,  net  restructuring and other charges and minority interest income
(expense).  in 1999,  net cash  provided by operating  activities  of continuing
operations  increased $1.3 billion,  primarily due to an increase in net income,
excluding the noncash impact of depreciation and amortization, net restructuring
and other charges and the impact of earnings and losses from equity investments.
this  increase was  partially  offset by higher  receivables,  due  primarily to
higher  revenue,  and an increase in tax payments from the gain on the 1998 sale
of ucs.

         at&amp;t;'s  investing  activities  resulted  in a net use of cash of  $39.9
billion  in  2000,  compared  with a net use of cash of $27.0  billion  in 1999.
during  2000,  at&amp;t;  used  approximately   $21.4  billion  for  acquisitions  of
businesses, primarily mediaone, and spent $15.5 billion on capital expenditures.
during 1999,  at&amp;t; spent  approximately  $14.3 billion on capital  expenditures,
approximately  $6.7 billion on acquisitions  of businesses,  primarily agns, and
contributed  $5.5 billion of cash to lmg. during 1998, we received $10.8 billion
related to the sales of businesses,  including  receivables from ucs,  partially
offset by capital expenditures of $7.8 billion.

         during  2000,  net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was $25.7
billion,  compared  with $13.4 billion in 1999.  in 2000,  at&amp;t;  received  $10.3
billion from the at&amp;t; wireless  group  tracking  stock  offering and borrowed an
additional  $17.0 billion of  short-term  debt and $2.5 billion of net long-term
debt.  these were partially  offset by the payment of $3.0 billion in dividends.
in 1999,  at&amp;t; received $10.2 billion from the issuance of commercial  paper and
short-term  debt,  $5.6 billion from the net issuance of long-term debt and $4.6
billion from the issuance of redeemable preferred  securities.  these sources of
cash were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of $4.6 billion
and the payment of dividends of $2.7 billion.  cash used in financing activities
in 1998  primarily  related to repayment of long-term and  short-term  debt, the
acquisition of treasury shares and dividends paid on common stock.
<page>

         at  december  31,  2000,  we had  current  assets of $17.1  billion and
current  liabilities  of $50.9  billion.  a  significant  portion of the current
liabilities,  $31.9 billion,  relates to short-term notes, the majority of which
were commercial paper or debt with an original  maturity of one year or less. we
expect that we will retire a portion of the short-term debt with other financing
arrangements,  including the monetization of publicly-held securities,  sales of
certain  non-strategic  assets and investments,  and  securitization  of certain
accounts  receivable.  at december 31, 2000, we had a current  liability of $2.6
billion, reflecting our obligation under put options held by comcast and cox. in
january 2001,  comcast and cox exercised  their rights under the put options and
elected to receive at&amp;t; stock in lieu of cash.  since december 31, 2000, we have
announced  the sale of  investments  or assets,  which will result in gross cash
proceeds of approximately  $4.6 billion.  in addition,  on february 28, 2001, we
exercised our registration rights in twe and formally requested twe to begin the
process of converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registered
equity securities. we have, however,  continued our ongoing discussions with aol
time warner for the sale of our stake in twe.

         in connection with the planned split-off of at&amp;t; wireless, we announced
that we will retain up to $3.0 billion in shares of at&amp;t; wireless, which we will
dispose of within six months  following the split-off.  also in connection  with
the split-off,  on march 6, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless  completed a $6.5 billion global
bond  offering.  at&amp;t;  wireless will  ultimately  use the proceeds to repay $4.8
billion in notes  receivable  and  preferred  stock that at&amp;t; common stock group
holds in at&amp;t;  wireless.  in addition on march 23, 2001,  at&amp;t; wireless  entered
into $2.5 billion in  revolving  credit  facilities.  the  facilities  include a
364-day tranche and a 5-year tranche.  the facilities are for general  corporate
purposes.

         another aspect of our restructuring is the expected sale, in late-2001,
of a new class of stock which will track our broadband business.

         at&amp;t; is in a joint  venture  with  alaska  native  wireless  (anw).  at
december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had  committed to fund anw up to $2.4 billion  based on
the outcome of fcc license  spectrum  auction.  in january 2001, the auction was
completed  and anw was the  highest  bidder on  approximately  $2.9  billion  in
licenses.

         since the announced  restructuring plans to create four new businesses,
at&amp;t;'s debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. as
a result of this review, at&amp;t;'s ratings have been downgraded and continued to be
on credit watch with negative outlook. these actions will result in an increased
cost of future borrowings and will limit our access to the capital markets.

         at&amp;t; is pursuing  various  measures to reduce its debt level.  however,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that
are acceptable to us. if these efforts cannot be completed  successfully,  or on
terms and within the timeframe contemplated, at&amp;t;'s financial condition would be
materially  adversely  affected.  some of these adverse  conditions  include the
company's ability to pursue  acquisitions,  make capital  expenditures to expand
its network and cable plant, or pay dividends.

         on  december  28,  2000,  we  entered  into  a  364-day,   $25  billion
revolving-credit  facility  syndicated to 39 banks, which was unused at december
31, 2000. as a result of certain  transactions  subsequent to december 31, 2000,
specifically  the  investment  by ntt docomo of $9.8  billion for a new class of
at&amp;t; preferred  stock,  and the $6.5 billion at&amp;t; wireless bond  offering,  this
credit facility was reduced to $18.3 billion.
<page>

         also  in  connection  with  our  restructuring,  we have  reviewed  our
dividend  policy as it relates to each of the new  businesses.  on december  20,
2000, we announced that the board of directors reduced at&amp;t;'s quarterly dividend
to $0.0375 per share, from $0.22 per share.

risk management

         we are  exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign
exchange  rates,  as well as changes in equity prices  associated with affiliate
companies.  in addition,  we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the
prices of  securities  which we  monetized  through the  issuance of debt.  on a
limited  basis,  we use  certain  derivative  financial  instruments,  including
interest  rate swaps,  options,  forwards,  equity  hedges and other  derivative
contracts,  to manage  these  risks.  we do not use  financial  instruments  for
trading  or  speculative  purposes.   all  financial  instruments  are  used  in
accordance with board-approved policies.

         we use  interest  rate  swaps to manage  the  impact of  interest  rate
changes  on  earnings  and cash  flows and also to lower our  overall  borrowing
costs.  we monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.
assuming a 10% downward shift in interest rates, the fair value of interest rate
swaps and the  underlying  hedged debt would have  changed by $10 million and $3
million at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  in 2000, we entered into a
combined interest rate,  forward contract to hedge  foreign-currency-denominated
debt.  assuming a 10%  downward  shift in both  interest  rates and the  foreign
currency,  the fair value of the contract and the  underlying  hedged debt would
have changed by $88 million. in addition,  certain debt is indexed to the market
prices of  securities we own.  changes in the market prices of these  securities
result in changes in the fair value of this debt. assuming a 10% downward change
in the market price of these  securities,  the fair value of the underlying debt
and  securities  would have  decreased  by $534  million at december  31,  2000.
assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest  rates at december 31, 2000 and 1999,
the fair value of unhedged  debt would have  increased  by $1.2 billion and $938
million, respectively.

         we use forward and option  contracts to reduce our exposure to the risk
of  adverse  changes  in  currency  exchange  rates.  we are  subject to foreign
exchange  risk  for  foreign-currency-denominated  transactions,  such  as  debt
issued. in addition, in 1999 we were subject to foreign exchange risk related to
reimbursements to foreign  telephone  companies for their portion of the revenue
billed by at&amp;t; for calls placed in the united  states to a foreign  country.  we
monitor  our foreign  exchange  rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.
assuming a 10%  appreciation  in the u.s.  dollar at december 31, 2000 and 1999,
the fair value of these contracts  would have resulted in additional  unrealized
losses of $6 million and $29 million, respectively.  because these contracts are
entered into for hedging purposes, we believe that these losses would be largely
offset by gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transactions.

         we use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity prices
associated  with  stock  appreciation  rights  (sars) of  affiliated  companies.
assuming a 10% decrease in equity prices of affiliated companies, the fair value
of the equity  hedges  would have  decreased  by $29  million and $81 million at
december 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  because these  contracts are entered
into for hedging  purposes,  we believe that the decrease in fair value would be
largely offset by gains on the underlying transaction.

         in  order  to  determine  the  changes  in fair  value  of our  various
financial instruments, we use certain modeling techniques, namely black-scholes,
for our sars and equity collars.  we apply rate sensitivity  changes directly to
our interest rate swap  transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign
currency forward contracts.
<page>

         the changes in fair value, as discussed above, assume the occurrence of
certain adverse market conditions.  they do not consider the potential effect of
favorable  changes in market  factors and do not represent  projected  losses in
fair  value  that we expect to incur.  future  impacts  would be based on actual
developments  in global  financial  markets.  we do not foresee any  significant
changes in the strategies  used to manage interest rate risk,  foreign  currency
rate risk or equity price risk in the near future.

         total assets  increased $72.8 billion,  or 43.0%, at december 31, 2000,
primarily  due to the impact of the  mediaone  acquisition,  which  resulted  in
increased  goodwill,  franchise  costs,  other  investments  including  twe  and
vodafone group plc; and the addition of property, plant and equipment. property,
plant and equipment also increased due to capital  expenditures  made during the
year, net of  depreciation  expense and equipment  contributed to concert.  this
equipment  contribution,  as well as a $1.0  billion  loan to  concert,  and our
investment  in  net2phone  are  reflected  as an increase to other  investments.
additionally, other receivables increased due to concert. wireless acquisitions,
including the impact of  consolidating  former equity  investments,  resulted in
increased licensing costs.

         total  liabilities at december 31, 2000,  increased  $46.0 billion,  or
55.2%,  primarily due to the impact of the mediaone acquisition,  including debt
of mediaone and borrowings to fund the acquisition, as well as the consolidation
of excite@home. in addition, total debt increased due to the monetization of our
investments in microsoft corporation and comcast.

         minority  interest  increased  $2.5 billion to $4.9 billion,  primarily
reflecting the minority interest of our ownership of excite@home  resulting from
the consolidation of excite@home  beginning september 1, 2000, and the preferred
stock outstanding of a mediaone subsidiary.

         total  shareowners'  equity was $103.2 billion at december 31, 2000, an
increase of 30.8% from december 31, 1999. this increase was primarily due to the
issuance  of at&amp;t;  common  stock  for the  mediaone  acquisition  as well as the
issuance of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.

         the ratio of total debt to total  capital,  excluding lmg (debt divided
by total  debt and  equity,  excluding  lmg) was  46.2% at  december  31,  2000,
compared with 43.0% at december 31, 1999. the equity portion of this calculation
includes  convertible  trust  preferred   securities,   as  well  as  subsidiary
redeemable  preferred  stock.  the increase was primarily  driven by higher debt
associated  with the mediaone  merger,  largely  offset by a higher  equity base
associated  with the mediaone  merger and the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock
offering.  the ratio of debt (net of cash) to ebitda was 3.28x at  december  31,
2000,  compared  with 1.88x at december 31,  1999,  reflecting  additional  debt
associated with the mediaone  merger.  included in debt was  approximately  $8.7
billion of notes, which are exchangeable into or collateralized by securities we
own. excluding this debt, the ratio of  net-debt-to-ebitda at december 31, 2000,
was 2.84x.

new accounting pronouncements

         in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb) issued
statement of financial  accounting  standards  (sfas) no. 133,  "accounting  for
derivative  instruments  and hedging  activities."  among other  provisions,  it
requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the  statement of financial  position and measure those  instruments  at fair
value.  gains and losses  resulting  from  changes  in the fair  values of those
derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the  derivative  and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  the effective date for this standard
was delayed via the  issuance of sfas no. 137. the  effective  date for sfas no.
133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after  june 15,  2000,  though  earlier
adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited. for at&amp;t;, this
means that the standard must be adopted no later than january 1, 2001.

         in june 2000,  the fasb issued sfas no.  138,  "accounting  for certain
derivative  instruments and certain hedging  activities" as an amendment to sfas
no.  133.  this  statement   provides   clarification  with  regard  to  certain
implementation issues under sfas no. 133 on specific types of hedges.

         on january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; adopted sfas no. 133. we recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$1.4 billion of income,  or  approximately  $0.34 per diluted  share,  primarily
attributable  to fair value  adjustments of debt  instruments,  including  those
acquired in  conjunction  with the  mediaone  merger,  as well as to our warrant
portfolio.  in  addition,  in  connection  with the adoption of sfas no. 133, we
reclassified certain investment  securities,  which support debt that is indexed
to   those   securities,    from   "available-for-sale"   to   "trading."   this
reclassification  resulted in the  recognition of a charge of $2.8 billion ($1.7
billion after income taxes), or approximately $0.43 per diluted share, which was
recorded as a  reduction  of other  income.  as  available-for-sale  securities,
changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive income
as a component of shareowners'  equity.  in addition,  lmg recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$0.8 billion of income, or approximately $0.31 per share.

         the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 133, as amended by sfas no. 138,
on at&amp;t;'s future  results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of our
derivatives  and related  financial  instruments  and could result in pronounced
quarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods.

         in  september  2000,  the fasb  issued sfas no.  140,  "accounting  for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and  extinguishments  of liabilities
- -- a replacement of fasb statement no. 125." this statement provides  accounting
and reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of  liabilities.  under  these  standards,  after a transfer of
financial  assets,  an entity  recognizes the financial and servicing  assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered,  and derecognizes  liabilities when  extinguished.
this statement provides  consistent  standards for  distinguishing  transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. this
statement is  effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of liabilities  occurring  after march 31, 2001.  at&amp;t; does not
expect that the  adoption of sfas no. 140 will have a material  impact on at&amp;t;'s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

subsequent events

         on january 12, 2001,  at&amp;t; announced that cox and comcast had exercised
their  rights to sell a combined  total of 60.4  million  shares of  excite@home
series a common stock to at&amp;t; as part of an  agreement  announced in august 2000
to  reorganize  excite@home's  governance.  cox and  comcast  elected to receive
shares of at&amp;t; common stock in exchange for their  excite@home  shares.  at&amp;t; is
currently in discussions  to renegotiate  the terms of the put options which may
result in a change to the number of shares of at&amp;t;  stock  that cox and  comcast
will receive, as well as the number of excite@home shares, if any at&amp;t; receives.
there  can be no  assurances  that an  agreement  will be  reached  with cox and
comcast.

         on  january  22,  2001,  at&amp;t;  and ntt  docomo  (docomo)  finalized  an
agreement whereby docomo invested  approximately $9.8 billion for a new class of
at&amp;t;  preferred  stock,   termed  docomo  wireless   tracking  stock,   that  is
economically  equivalent to 406 million  shares of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking
stock and reflects  approximately 16% of the financial  performance and economic
value of at&amp;t; wireless  group.  at&amp;t;  allocated  $6.2 billion of the proceeds to
at&amp;t; wireless group. each share of docomo wireless tracking stock is convertible
at any time into at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.  upon the conversion of the
docomo wireless  tracking  stock,  at&amp;t; will reduce its portion of the financial
performance and economic value in at&amp;t; wireless group by 178 million shares, and
the balance of the 406 million shares will come from the issuance of 228 million
new shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock. additionally,  upon completion
of the planned  split-off of at&amp;t; wireless,  the docomo wireless  tracking stock
and related  warrants will  automatically  be converted into at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking stock in the split-off.  in the event that at&amp;t;
has not split-off at&amp;t; wireless by specified  dates  beginning  january 1, 2002,
docomo will have the right, at its election,  to require at&amp;t; to repurchase from
docomo  the  preferred  shares  initially  issued to them at  docomo's  original
purchase price plus interest up to the date of payment.  the interest under this
right will be treated as preferred  stock  dividends with charges  recorded as a
reduction of at&amp;t; common stock group  earnings.  in  addition,  docomo  acquired
five-year  warrants to purchase the  equivalent  of an  additional  41.7 million
shares of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock at $35 per share.  as part of the
agreement,  docomo  obtained  a seat on at&amp;t;'s  board of  directors  until  at&amp;t;
wireless is split-off from at&amp;t; as a separate public company,  which is expected
to occur later in 2001. at that time,  docomo will retain  representation on the
new public at&amp;t; wireless board.

         in january  2001,  at&amp;t; entered into  agreements  with certain  network
equipment  vendors,  which  extend  through  2004,  to purchase  next-generation
wireless network equipment for a total of approximately $1.8 billion.

group plc to sell our 10% stake in japan telecom co. ltd for approximately $1.35
billion in cash.  the  transaction is expected to be completed in april 2001 and
will result in a gain.

         on march 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless  completed a private  placement of $6.5
billion in notes.  the notes pay  interest at rates  ranging from 7.35% to 8.75%
per annum,  with  maturity  dates  ranging from 2006 to 2031.  the notes include
customary covenants and registration rights.

         on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless entered into $2.5 billion in revolving
credit facilities. the facilities consist of a 364-day facility of $1.25 billion
and a five-year  revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion.  the facilities may
be used for general  corporate  purposes and are subject to customary  covenants
and events of default.

item 8.    financial statements and supplementary data.


         report of management

         management  is   responsible   for  the   preparation,   integrity  and
objectivity of the  consolidated  financial  statements and all other  financial
information  included  in  this  report.  management  is  also  responsible  for
maintaining a system of internal  controls as a fundamental  requirement for the
operational and financial integrity of results. the financial statements,  which
reflect the  consolidated  accounts of at&amp;t; corp.  and  subsidiaries  (at&amp;t;) and
other financial  information  shown,  were prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting  principles.  estimates included in the financial statements
were based on  judgments  of  qualified  personnel.  to  maintain  its system of
internal  controls,  management  carefully selects key personnel and establishes
the   organizational   structure   to  provide  an   appropriate   division   of
responsibility.  we  believe it is  essential  to  conduct  business  affairs in
accordance with the highest  ethical  standards as set forth in the at&amp;t; code of
conduct. these guidelines and other informational programs are designed and used
to ensure that  policies,  standards and managerial  authorities  are understood
throughout the organization.  our internal auditors monitor  compliance with the
system of internal controls by means of an annual plan of internal audits. on an
ongoing  basis,  the system of internal  controls  is  reviewed,  evaluated  and
revised as necessary in light of the results of constant  management  oversight,
internal  and  independent   audits,   changes  in  at&amp;t;'s  business  and  other
conditions. management believes that the system of internal controls, taken as a
whole, provides reasonable assurance that (1) financial records are adequate and
can be  relied  upon to  permit  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and (2) access to
assets occurs only in accordance with management's authorizations.

         the audit  committee  of the board of  directors,  which is composed of
directors  who  are not  employees,  meets  periodically  with  management,  the
internal auditors and the independent  accountants to review the manner in which
these groups of individuals are performing their  responsibilities  and to carry
out the audit  committee's  oversight  role with respect to  auditing,  internal
controls  and  financial  reporting  matters.  periodically,  both the  internal
auditors and the independent accountants meet privately with the audit committee
and have access to its individual members at any time.

         the consolidated  financial  statements in this annual report have been
audited by  pricewaterhousecoopers  llp, independent  accountants.  their audits
were conducted in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards and
include an assessment of the internal  control  structure and selective tests of
transactions. their report follows.

c. michael armstrong                        charles h. noski

                        report of independent accountants

to the board of directors and shareowners of at&amp;t; corp.:

         in our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of other  auditors,
the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and the  related  consolidated
statements of income,  changes in shareowners'  equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of at&amp;t; corp. and its
subsidiaries  (at&amp;t;) at  december  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years ended  december 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the united
states.  these financial statements are the responsibility of at&amp;t;'s management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits. we did not audit the financial statements of liberty media group,
an equity method investee,  which was acquired by at&amp;t; on march 9, 1999.  at&amp;t;'s
financial  statements  include an  investment  of $34,290  million  and  $38,460
million as of  december  31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and  equity  method
earnings  (losses) of $1,488 million and $(2,022)  million,  for the years ended
december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. those statements were audited by other
auditors  whose  report  thereon  has  been  furnished  to us,  and our  opinion
expressed  herein,  insofar as it relates to the  amounts  included  for liberty
media group,  as of and for the years ended december 31, 2000 and 1999, is based
solely on the report of the other  auditors.  we  conducted  our audits of these
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
united  states,  which  require  that we plan and  perform  the  audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  we believe that our
audits  and the  report of other  auditors  provide a  reasonable  basis for the
opinion expressed above.

 at&amp;t; corp. and subsidiaries (at&amp;t;) notes to consolidated financial statements
      dollars in millions unless otherwise noted (except per share amounts)

1.  summary of significant accounting policies

consolidation

         the   consolidated   financial   statements   include  all   controlled
subsidiaries.  all significant  intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.  investments in majority-owned  subsidiaries  where
control  does  not  exist  and  investments  in which  we  exercise  significant
influence  but do not control  (generally a 20% to 50%  ownership  interest) are
accounted  for under  the  equity  method of  accounting.  this  represents  the
majority  of our  investments.  investments  in  which we have  less  than a 20%
ownership interest and in which there is no significant  influence are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting.

foreign currency translation

         for  operations  outside  the  united  states  that  prepare  financial
statements  in  currencies  other  than the u.s.  dollar,  we  translate  income
statement  amounts  at average  exchange  rates for the year,  and we  translate
assets and liabilities at year-end  exchange rates. we present these translation
adjustments  as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income within
shareowners'  equity.  gains and losses from foreign  currency  transactions are
included in results of operations.

revenue recognition

         we recognize long distance,  local and wireless  services revenue based
upon  minutes  of  traffic   processed  or  contracted  fee   schedules.   cable
installation  revenue is recognized in the period the installation  services are
provided to the extent of direct selling costs. any remaining amount is deferred
and recognized over the estimated  average period that customers are expected to
remain connected to the cable distribution  systems.  customer  activation fees,
along with the related  costs,  are  deferred  and  amortized  over the customer
relationship  period. the revenue and related expenses  associated with the sale
of wireless  handsets  and  accessories  are  recognized  when the  products are
delivered  and accepted by  customers,  as this is  considered  to be a separate
earnings process from the sale of wireless services. we recognize other products
and services  revenue when the products are  delivered and accepted by customers
and when services are provided in accordance with contract  terms.  during 2000,
we adopted  securities and exchange  commission (sec) staff accounting  bulletin
no. 101,  "revenue  recognition in financial  statements".  the adoption did not
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

advertising and promotional costs

         we  expense  costs  of  advertising  and  promotions,   including  cash
incentives used to acquire customers,  as incurred.  advertising and promotional
expenses were $1,995, $1,804 and $1,920 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. of
these amounts,  $288, $320 and $622 were cash incentives to acquire customers in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

investment tax credits

         we amortize  investment tax credits as a reduction to the provision for
income taxes over the useful lives of the assets that produced the credits.
<page>

cash equivalents

         we consider all highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of
generally three months or less to be cash equivalents.

property, plant and equipment

         we  state   property,   plant  and  equipment  at  cost  and  determine
depreciation  based upon the assets'  estimated  useful  lives using  either the
group or unit method.  the useful lives of communications  and network equipment
range from three to 15 years.  the useful lives of other  equipment  ranges from
three to seven years. the useful lives of buildings and improvements  range from
10 to 40 years. the group method is used for most depreciable assets,  including
the majority of  communications  and network  equipment.  when we sell or retire
assets  depreciated using the group method,  the cost is deducted from property,
plant and equipment and charged to accumulated depreciation, without recognition
of a gain or loss. the unit method is primarily used for large computer  systems
and support  assets.  when we sell assets that were  depreciated  using the unit
method, we include the related gains or losses in other income.

         we  use  accelerated   depreciation   methods   primarily  for  certain
high-technology  computer-processing equipment and digital equipment used in the
telecommunications  network,  except for switching  equipment  placed in service
before  1989,  where a  straight-line  method  is  used.  all  other  plant  and
equipment,  including  capitalized  software,  is depreciated on a straight-line
basis.

licensing costs

         licensing  costs are costs  incurred to acquire  cellular  and personal
communications   services   (pcs)   licenses.   amortization   begins  with  the
commencement  of service to customers  and is computed  using the  straight-line
method over periods of 35 or 40 years.

franchise costs

         franchise  costs include the value  attributed to agreements with local
authorities  that  allow  access to homes in cable  service  areas  acquired  in
connection  with  business  combinations.   such  amounts  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line basis over 40 years.

goodwill

         goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
assets  acquired  in  business  combinations  accounted  for under the  purchase
method.  we  amortize  goodwill  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  periods
benefited, ranging from five to 40 years.

software capitalization

         certain direct development costs associated with internal-use  software
are capitalized,  including external direct costs of material and services,  and
payroll costs for employees devoting time to the software projects.  these costs
are included  within other assets and are amortized  over a period not to exceed
five  years  beginning  when the asset is  substantially  ready  for use.  costs
incurred  during the  preliminary  project  stage,  as well as  maintenance  and
training  costs,  are  expensed  as  incurred.  at&amp;t;  also  capitalizes  initial
operating-system  software  costs  and  amortizes  them  over  the  life  of the
associated hardware.
<page>

         at&amp;t;  also  capitalizes   costs  associated  with  the  development  of
application  software  incurred  from  the  time  technological  feasibility  is
established  until the software is ready to provide service to customers.  these
capitalized  costs  are  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  and are
amortized over a useful life not to exceed five years.

valuation of long-lived assets

         long-lived  assets,  such as property,  plant and equipment,  licensing
costs,  franchise costs,  goodwill,  investments and software,  are reviewed for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying  amount may not be  recoverable.  if the total of the  expected  future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is
recognized for the  difference  between the fair value and carrying value of the
asset. in addition, in accordance with accounting principles board (apb) opinion
no. 17, "intangible assets", we continue to evaluate the amortization periods to
determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised amortization periods.

derivative financial instruments

         we use various financial  instruments,  including  derivative financial
instruments, for purposes other than trading. we do not use derivative financial
instruments  for  speculative  purposes.   derivatives,  used  as  part  of  our
risk-management  strategy,  must be  designated  at  inception  as a  hedge  and
measured for effectiveness  both at inception and on an ongoing basis. gains and
losses related to qualifying  hedges of foreign  currency firm  commitments  are
deferred  in  current  assets  or  liabilities  and  recognized  as  part of the
underlying  transactions as they occur. all other foreign exchange contracts are
marked to market on a current  basis,  and the  respective  gains or losses  are
recognized in other income. interest rate differentials associated with interest
rate swaps used to hedge at&amp;t;'s debt  obligations  are recorded as an adjustment
to interest payable or receivable,  with the offset to interest expense over the
life of the swaps. if we terminate an interest rate swap agreement,  the gain or
loss is deferred and amortized over the remaining  life of the  liability.  cash
flows from financial  instruments are classified in the consolidated  statements
of cash flows  under the same  categories  as the cash  flows  from the  related
assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions.

use of estimates

         the  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements,  and revenue and expenses during the period reported. actual results
could  differ  from those  estimates.  estimates  are used when  accounting  for
certain  items such as long-term  contracts,  allowance  for doubtful  accounts,
depreciation  and  amortization,  employee benefit plans,  taxes,  restructuring
reserves and contingencies.

concentrations

         as of december 31, 2000, we do not have any  significant  concentration
of  business  transacted  with a  particular  customer,  supplier or lender that
could, if suddenly  eliminated,  severely impact our operations.  we also do not
have a concentration of available  sources of labor,  services,  franchises,  or
licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact our
operations. we invest our cash with several high-quality credit institutions.
<page>

issuance of common stock by affiliates

         changes  in our  proportionate  share  of the  underlying  equity  of a
subsidiary  or  equity  method  investee,  which  result  from the  issuance  of
additional  equity  securities  by such entity,  are  recognized as increases or
decreases  to  additional  paid-in  capital in the  consolidated  statements  of
shareowners' equity.

reclassifications and restatements

         we  reclassified  certain  amounts for previous years to conform to the
2000  presentation.  in  addition,  we  restated  prior year share and per share
amounts to reflect the june 2000 two-for-one split of liberty media group common
stock.

2.  restructuring of at&amp;t;

         on october 25, 2000,  we  announced a  restructuring  plan  designed to
fully  separate  or issue  separately  tracked  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial  performance and economic value of each of at&amp;t;'s four major operating
units. upon completion of the plan, at&amp;t; wireless, at&amp;t; broadband, at&amp;t; business
and at&amp;t; consumer will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.

         as part of the first phase of the  restructuring  plan, we are planning
an exchange offer that will give at&amp;t;  shareowners  the  opportunity to exchange
any  portion of their at&amp;t;  common  shares  for  shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group
tracking stock, subject to pro-ration.  following the exchange offer and subject
to specified conditions,  at&amp;t; plans to split-off at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t.;
we intend,  however,  to retain up to $3 billion of shares of at&amp;t;  wireless for
future sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.
we expect at&amp;t; wireless  will become an  independent,  publicly-held  company in
mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals.

         in  addition  to the  split-off  of at&amp;t;  wireless,  we intend to fully
separate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial  performance
and economic value of each of our other major business  units. we plan to create
and issue new classes of stock to track the financial  performance  and economic
value of our at&amp;t;  broadband  unit and at&amp;t; consumer  unit. we plan to sell some
percentage of shares of the at&amp;t; broadband  unit in the fall of 2001.  within 12
months of such sale, we intend to completely  separate at&amp;t; broadband from at&amp;t;,
as an  asset-based  stock.  the at&amp;t; consumer  tracking  stock is expected to be
fully distributed to at&amp;t; shareowners in the second half of 2001.

         at&amp;t;  expects  that  these   transactions  will  be  tax-free  to  u.s.
shareholders.   at&amp;t;'s   restructuring   plan  is  complicated  and  involves  a
substantial  number  of steps  and  transactions,  including  obtaining  various
conditions,  such as internal revenue service (irs) rulings. in addition, future
financial conditions,  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur
that make it  inadvisable  to proceed  with part or all of at&amp;t;'s  restructuring
plans. any or all of the elements of at&amp;t;'s  restructuring plan may not occur as
we currently  expect or in the timeframes that we currently  contemplate,  or at
all.  alternative forms of restructuring,  including sales of interests in these
businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution  to shareowners in
the restructuring.

         on november 15, 2000,  at&amp;t; announced that our board of directors voted
to  split-off  liberty  media  group  (lmg),   which  we  acquired  through  our
acquisition  of  tele-communications,  inc. a new  asset-based  security will be
issued to holders  of lmg  tracking  stock in  exchange  for their lmg  tracking
shares.  the split-off remains subject to receipt of a favorable tax ruling from
the irs. we expect this split-off to be completed in mid-2001.

4.  mergers with mediaone group, inc. and tele-communications, inc.



merger with mediaone group, inc.

         on june 15, 2000,  at&amp;t;  completed a merger with mediaone  group,  inc.
(mediaone) in a cash and stock transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
for  each  share  of  mediaone  stock,  mediaone  shareowners  received,  in the
aggregate,  0.95 of a share of at&amp;t;  common  stock and $36.27 per share in cash,
consisting of $30.85 per share as  stipulated in the merger  agreement and $5.42
per share based on at&amp;t;'s stock price  preceding  the merger,  which was below a
predetermined  amount.  at&amp;t; issued  approximately  603 million shares of common
stock in the  transaction,  of which  approximately  60  million  were  treasury
shares.  the at&amp;t; shares had an  aggregate  market  value of  approximately  $21
billion and cash payments totaled approximately $24 billion.

         the merger was  accounted for under the purchase  method.  accordingly,
the results of mediaone  have been  included  in the  accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements  since the date of  acquisition  as part of our  broadband
segment.

         approximately $16 billion of the purchase price of $45 billion has been
attributed to agreements with local franchise  authorities  that allow access to
homes in our broadband service areas ("franchise  costs") and is being amortized
on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. also included in the purchase price was
approximately  $22 billion  related to  nonconsolidated  investments,  including
investments in time warner entertainment  company, l.p. (twe) and vodafone group
plc  (vodafone),  approximately  $5  billion  related  to  property,  plant  and
equipment,  and  approximately  $7 billion  of other net  assets.  in  addition,
included  was  approximately   $14  billion  in  deferred  income   liabilities,
approximately  $10 billion  attributable to mediaone debt, and  approximately $1
billion of minority  interest in centaur  funding  corporation,  a subsidiary of
mediaone.  the purchase  resulted in preliminary  goodwill of approximately  $20
billion,  which is being amortized on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. at&amp;t;
may make  refinements  to the allocation of the purchase price in future periods
as the related  fair value  appraisals  of certain  assets and  liabilities  are
finalized.
<page>

merger with tele-communications, inc.

         on march 9, 1999,  at&amp;t;  completed a merger  with  tele-communications,
inc.  (tci),  renamed  at&amp;t;  broadband,  in an all-stock  transaction  valued at
approximately  $52  billion.  each share of tci group  series a common stock was
converted into 1.16355 shares of at&amp;t; common stock,  and each share of tci group
series b common stock was  converted  into 1.27995  shares of at&amp;t; common stock.
at&amp;t; issued approximately 664 million shares of common stock in the transaction,
of which  approximately 149 million were treasury shares. the at&amp;t; shares had an
aggregate market value of approximately $27 billion. certain subsidiaries of tci
held tci group  series a common  stock,  which was  converted  into 216  million
shares of at&amp;t; common stock. these  subsidiaries  continue to hold these shares,
which are reflected as treasury stock in the accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets.

         in  addition,  tci  simultaneously  combined  its  liberty  media group
programming business with its tci ventures group technology investment business,
forming lmg. in connection with the closing, at&amp;t; issued separate tracking stock
in exchange  for the tci liberty  media group and tci  ventures  group  tracking
shares previously  outstanding.  we issued 2,280 million shares of liberty media
group  class a tracking  stock  (including  120  million  shares  related to the
conversion of  convertible  notes) and 220 million shares of liberty media group
class b tracking  stock.  the tracking stock is designed to reflect the separate
financial  performance  and economic value of lmg. these shares had an aggregate
market value of approximately $23 billion.

         at&amp;t;  does not have a  controlling  financial  interest  for  financial
accounting purposes in lmg. therefore,  our investment in lmg has been reflected
as an  investment  accounted  for under the  equity  method in the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements. the amounts attributable to lmg are reflected
as "equity  earnings  (losses)  from  liberty  media group" and  "investment  in
liberty  media  group  and  related   receivables,   net"  in  the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements.  as a separate  tracking stock,  all of the
earnings or losses  related to lmg are excluded  from the earnings  available to
the holders of at&amp;t; common stock.

         each share of liberty  media group class a common  stock is entitled to
0.0375 of a vote,  and each share of liberty media group class b common stock is
entitled to 0.375 of a vote.

         the  tci  merger  was   accounted   for  under  the  purchase   method.
accordingly,  the results of tci have been included in the financial  results of
at&amp;t;  since the date of  acquisition.  the  operating  results  of tci have been
included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements at their fair
value  since  march 1,  1999,  the  deemed  effective  date of  acquisition  for
accounting  purposes.  the impact of the results  from march 1 through  march 9,
1999, were deemed immaterial to our consolidated results.

         approximately  $20  billion of the  purchase  price of $52  billion was
attributed to franchise costs and is being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis
over 40 years.  pursuant to statement of financial  accounting  standards (sfas)
no. 109, "accounting for income taxes," at&amp;t; recorded an approximate $13 billion
deferred tax liability in connection  with this franchise  intangible,  which is
also  included  in  franchise  costs.  we do not expect that this  deferred  tax
liability will ever be paid. this deferred tax liability is being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years and is included in the  provision  for income
taxes. also included was  approximately  $11 billion related to  nonconsolidated
investments,  approximately $5 billion related to property, plant and equipment,

<page>

approximately  $11 billion of tci long-term  debt and  approximately  $7 billion
related  to other  net  liabilities.  in  addition,  our  investment  in lmg was
recorded at approximately  $34 billion,  including  approximately $11 billion of
goodwill  that is being  amortized on a straight-  line basis over 20 years as a
component of "equity earnings (losses) from liberty media group."

5.       other  mergers, acquisitions, stock offering, venture, dispositions and
         discontinued operations


ab cellular

         on december 29, 2000, ab cellular  completed  the  redemption of at&amp;t;'s
equity  interest in ab cellular.  prior to that date,  at&amp;t; held a 55.62% equity
interest  in ab  cellular,  which was formed in 1998 with  bellsouth,  with each
party having a 50% voting interest. ab cellular owned, controlled and supervised
wireless properties in los angeles,  houston,  and galveston,  texas.  bellsouth
exercised an option  available to it,  which  resulted in ab cellular  redeeming
at&amp;t;'s interest in ab cellular in exchange for 100% of the net assets of the los
angeles property.  ab cellular  recognized a significant gain upon completion of
the transaction.  accordingly, net losses from other equity investments included
$603  representing  our portion of this gain,  and other  income  included a net
pretax loss of $184 related to the difference  between the carrying value of our
investment in ab cellular and the fair market value of the los angeles property.
as a result of this transaction,  we consolidated the los angeles property.  the
consolidation  resulted in  licensing  costs of $2.2  billion,  goodwill of $0.8
billion,  other net assets of $0.6 billion and the removal of our  investment in
ab cellular of $3.8 billion.

telecorp pcs, inc.

         on november 13, 2000, two of at&amp;t;'s wireless affiliates,  telecorp pcs,
inc.  (telecorp) and tritel,  inc.,  merged as part of a stock  transaction.  in
connection  with the merger,  at&amp;t;  contributed  to  telecorp  rights to acquire
wireless  licenses in wisconsin  and iowa,  paid  approximately  $20 in cash and
extended the term of its brand license  agreement through july 2005, in exchange
for  approximately  9.3 million  additional  common  shares in the newly  merged
entity. in a separate  transaction,  at&amp;t; exchanged certain additional  wireless
licenses and rights to acquire  licenses in the wisconsin and iowa markets,  and
made a cash payment of  approximately  $80 for certain telecorp pcs licenses and
wireless systems in several new england markets.  these transactions resulted in
a net pretax gain of $379. the acquisition of the wireless systems was accounted
for under the purchase  method.  the pro forma impact of the wireless systems on
historical at&amp;t; results is not material.

at home corporation

         on  august  28,  2000,  at&amp;t;  and  at  home  corporation  (excite@home)
announced  shareholder  approval  of a new  board of  directors  and  governance
structure  for  excite@home  and  completion  of the  extension of  distribution
contracts with at&amp;t;,  cox  communications,  inc.  (cox) and comcast  corporation
(comcast). at&amp;t; was given the right to designate six of the 11 excite@home board
members. in addition,  excite@home converted  approximately 50 million of at&amp;t;'s
series a shares into series b shares, each of which has 10 votes. as a result of
these  governance  changes,   at&amp;t;  gained  a  controlling  interest  and  began
consolidating  excite@home's  results  upon the  closing of the  transaction  on
september 1, 2000. as of december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had, on a fully diluted basis,
approximately  23% of the economic  interest  and 74% of the voting  interest in
excite@home.

         in exchange  for cox and comcast  relinquishing  their rights under the
shareholder agreement, at&amp;t; granted put options to cox and comcast on a combined
total of 60.4  million  shares of  excite@home  series a common  stock.  the put
options  provide cox and  comcast  with the right to convert  their  excite@home
shares  into  either  at&amp;t; stock or cash at their  option,  at any time  between
january 1, 2001 and june 4, 2002, at the higher of (i) $48 per share or (ii) the
30-day average trading price at the time of exercise  (beginning 15 trading days
prior to the exercise  date,  and ending 15 days after the exercise  date).  the
maximum  amount  that  at&amp;t;  would  be  required  to pay in  cash  or  stock  is
approximately  $2.9 billion based on the $48 strike price.  the obligation under
these put options was  recorded  at fair value,  with gains or losses  resulting
from changes in fair value being  recorded as a component of other  income.  for
the year,  changes in fair market  value  resulted in a pretax  expense of $537.
subsequent to december 31, 2000,  cox and comcast  exercised  their put options,
electing to receive at&amp;t; common shares (see note 23).

         also,  in  connection  with the  distribution  agreements  which extend
through 2008, at&amp;t; obtained the right to purchase up to approximately 25 million
excite@home series a shares and 25 million series b shares. in addition, cox and
comcast  will each receive new warrants to purchase two series a shares for each
home its cable system passes. these warrants will vest in installments every six
months  beginning in june 2001, and will be fully vested by june 2006 if cox and
comcast elect to continue their extended non-exclusive  distribution  agreements
through that period.

         the  consolidation  of  excite@home  resulted in  minority  interest of
approximately $2.2 billion,  goodwill of approximately $2.4 billion,  short-term
liabilities  of  approximately  $2.4  billion  (including  an initial put option
liability),  other net assets of  approximately  $1.2 billion and the removal of
our investment in excite@home of approximately $1.9 billion.

used for acquisitions,  network expansion,  capital expenditures and for general
corporate purposes.  the remaining net proceeds of $3.3 billion were utilized by
at&amp;t; for general  corporate  purposes.  holders of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking
stock are  entitled  to one-half of a vote per share.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group
tracking stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "awe."

stock held by cox in exchange  for an entity  owning  cable  television  systems
serving   approximately   312,000   customers  and  certain  other  net  assets.
specifically,  at&amp;t; exchanged $1.1 billion of investments and related  advances,

inc. to a subsidiary of comcast.  in connection  with the sale, we received 47.3
million shares of comcast class a special common stock. the transaction resulted
in a pretax gain of $224.

concert

         on  january  5,  2000,  at&amp;t; and  british  telecommunications  plc (bt)
announced  financial  closure of  concert,  their  global  communications  joint

well  as  the  economic  value  of  approximately  270  multinational  customers
specifically targeted for direct sales by concert.

acc europe

         on november  5, 1999,  at&amp;t; sold acc corp.  (acc) in europe,  including
acc's  principal  operations  in the united  kingdom as well as acc's  operating
companies in france, germany and italy, to worldxchange communications.  we were
required to dispose of this investment pursuant to a government mandate since it
would have competed directly with concert.  the transaction resulted in a pretax
loss of $179.

ibm global network

         on april 30, 1999,  at&amp;t;  completed its  acquisition  of the ibm global
network  business  (renamed at&amp;t; global network services or agns) and its assets
in the  united  states.  the  non-u.s.  acquisitions  were  completed  in phases
throughout  1999 and  during the first  quarter of 2000.  under the terms of the
agreement,  at&amp;t;  acquired  the  global  network of ibm,  and the two  companies
entered  into  outsourcing  agreements  with each  other.  the  acquisition  was
accounted for under the purchase method.  accordingly,  the operating results of
agns have been included in the accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements
since the date of  acquisition.  the pro forma impact of agns on historical at&amp;t;
results is not material.

teleport communications group inc.

         on july 23, 1998, at&amp;t; completed a merger with teleport  communications
group inc.  (tcg)  pursuant to an agreement  and plan of merger dated january 8,
1998.  each share of tcg common stock was  exchanged  for 1.4145  shares of at&amp;t;
common  stock,  resulting  in  the  issuance  of  272.4  million  shares  in the
transaction.  the  merger  was  accounted  for as a pooling  of  interests,  and
accordingly,  at&amp;t;'s  results of operations,  financial  position and cash flows
were  restated  to  reflect  the  merger.   in  1998,   we  recognized   $85  of
merger-related  expenses.  premerger  tcg revenue was $455,  and net losses were
$118, for the six months ended june 30, 1998.  elimination  entries between at&amp;t;
and tcg were not material. on april 22, 1998, tcg purchased acc for an aggregate
value of approximately $1,100, including approximately $700 in goodwill.

other dispositions

         on march 3,  1998,  at&amp;t;  sold its 45%  common  share  interest  in lin

$3,500 to citigroup,  inc. the after-tax gain resulting from the disposal of ucs
was  $1,290,  or $0.48 per diluted  share.  included  in the  transaction  was a
cobranding and  joint-marketing  agreement.  in addition,  we received $5,722 in
settlement of receivables from ucs.

         the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  at&amp;t;  reflect  ucs  as  a
discontinued operation.  accordingly,  the revenue, costs and expenses, and cash
flows of this business have been  excluded from the  respective  captions in the
1998 consolidated  statement of income and consolidated statement of cash flows,
and  have  been  reported  through  the  date of  disposition  as  "income  from
discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable  income  taxes,  and as "net cash
provided  by  discontinued  operations"  for all  periods  presented.  the  gain
associated  with  this  sale is  reflected  as  "gain  on  sale of  discontinued

         basic  earnings  per share (eps) for at&amp;t; common  stock group for 2000,
1999 and 1998 were  computed by dividing  at&amp;t; common  stock group income by the
weighted- average number of shares  outstanding  during the year.

         diluted eps for at&amp;t; common stock group was  computed by dividing  at&amp;t;
common stock group income,  adjusted for the  conversion of  securities,  by the
weighted-average  number of shares and  dilutive  potential  shares  outstanding
during the year, assuming conversion of the potential shares at the beginning of
the years  presented.  shares  issuable upon  conversion  of preferred  stock of
subsidiaries, convertible debt securities of subsidiary, stock options and other
performance   awards  have  been   included  in  the  diluted   calculation   of
weighted-average  shares to the extent that the assumed  issuance of such shares
would have been dilutive, as illustrated below. the convertible quarterly income
preferred securities were antidilutive and were excluded from the computation of
diluted eps.  computed on a yearly basis,  the dividends would have an after-tax
impact to earnings of approximately $155. assuming conversion of the securities,
the  dividends  would no longer be included as a reduction to net income and the
securities would convert into 67 million shares of at&amp;t; common stock.

diluted eps  calculations  with  respect to at&amp;t; common  stock group  continuing
operations is as follows:

         basic eps for at&amp;t;  wireless  group for the period from april 27, 2000,
the stock  offering  date,  through  december 31, 2000, was computed by dividing
at&amp;t; wireless group income by the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding
of at&amp;t;  wireless  group of 361  million.  there  were no  potentially  dilutive
securities outstanding at december 31, 2000.

         basic eps for lmg was  computed  by dividing  lmg income  (loss) by the
weighted-average  number of shares  outstanding  of lmg of 2,572 million in 2000
and 2,519 million from the march 9, 1999, date of issuance  through december 31,
1999. potentially dilutive securities, including fixed and nonvested performance
awards and stock options,  have not been factored into the dilutive calculations
because past history has indicated that these contracts are generally settled in
cash.  there  were 96 million  and 124  million  of these  potentially  dilutive
securities outstanding at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  the diluted
earnings per share  calculation  for 2000 also  excludes  approximately  700,000
warrants outstanding at december 31, 2000, which were antidilutive. in addition,
since lmg had a loss in 1999, the impact of any potential shares would have been
antidilutive.

7.  net restructuring and other charges

         during 2000, we recorded $7,029 of net restructuring and other charges,
which included $6,179 of asset impairment  charges related to excite@home,  $759
for  restructuring  and exit costs  associated with at&amp;t;'s  initiative to reduce
costs,  and  $91  related  to  the   government-mandated   disposition  of  at&amp;t;
communications (u.k.) ltd., which would have competed directly with concert.

         the charges related to excite@home  included $4,609 of asset impairment
charges recorded by excite@home  associated with the impairment of goodwill from
various acquisitions, including excite, and a related goodwill impairment charge
of $1,570  recorded by at&amp;t; associated with goodwill from the acquisition of our
investment in excite@home.

         the  impairments   resulted  from  the   deterioration  of  the  market
conditions and market valuations of internet-related companies during the fourth
quarter of 2000,  which caused  excite@home to conclude that  intangible  assets
related  to  their  acquisitions  of  internet-related   companies  may  not  be
recoverable.  in accordance with sfas no. 121, "accounting for the impairment of
long-lived  assets and for  long-lived  assets to be disposed  of",  excite@home
conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
acquired  intangible  assets.  this assessment  resulted in a determination that
certain  acquired  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  related  to  these
acquisitions,  including  excite,  were  impaired as of december 31, 2000.  as a
result, we recorded impairment charges of $4,609 in december 2000,  representing
the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over their fair value.

         the review for impairment included a review of publicly-traded internet
companies that are comparable to the companies that excite@home acquired.  these
companies   experienced  a  substantial   decline  in  stock  price  and  market
capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2000.

         excite@home also reviewed the business climate for internet advertising
and web-based infrastructure companies as of december 31, 2000, and observed the
following: (1) investor and consumer enthusiasm for the internet sector severely
deteriorated  during the fourth  quarter of 2000;  (2) many internet  companies,
including those acquired by excite@home,  experienced significant  decelerations
in  their  growth  both  as  a  result  of  economic   conditions   and  due  to
internet-sector  specific  issues such as  competition  and the weakening of the

<page>

internet advertising market; and (3) funding sources for internet-based consumer
businesses,  which require  considerable  amounts of capital,  had substantially
evaporated  as of december 31, 2000.  as a result,  excite@home  concluded  that
fundamental,  permanent and significant  adverse changes had occurred during the
fourth quarter of 2000 in the business climate for companies  providing internet
advertising and other web-based services.

         in addition,  excite@home  reviewed operating and cash flow projections
that existed at the time excite@home made the acquisitions and that were used as
a basis upon which the decisions to complete the  acquisitions  were made. these
operating and cash flow projections indicated that the acquired companies,  over
their useful lives,  would be profitable and generate  positive cash flows.  the
operating and cash flow projections were compared to operating results after the
date of the  acquisitions  through  december 31,  2000,  as well as to projected
operating   results  for  2001.   these   comparisons   indicated  that  certain
acquisitions  generated  operating and cash flow losses through the end of 2000,
and were projected to continue generating operating and cash flow losses for the
foreseeable future.

         as  a  result  of  these  factors,   excite@home  determined  that  the
intangible  assets  related to the  acquisitions  might not be  recoverable  and
conducted impairment tests.

         generally,  the impairment tests were performed at an asset group level
corresponding  to the  lowest  level at which cash  flows  independent  of other
assets  could be  identified.  each asset group  consisted  of the  goodwill and
acquired  identifiable  intangible  assets  related to a  specific  acquisition.
acquired intangible assets were combined for those acquisitions where separately
identifiable cash flows that are largely  independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets could not be identified.

         for each of the asset groups to be tested for  impairment,  excite@home
projected undiscounted cash flows over a future projection period of five years,
based on excite@home's  determination  of the current  remaining useful lives of
the asset  groups,  plus an  undiscounted  terminal  period cash flow to reflect
disposition  of the  entities  at the end of their  useful  lives.  undiscounted
future cash flows were estimated using projected net realizable value in a sales
transaction  (undiscounted  cash flows  during the  expected  remaining  holding
period until disposition were estimated as negligible).  the undiscounted future
cash flows were  compared  to the  carrying  amount of each asset  group and for
those asset groups where the carrying  amount exceeded the  undiscounted  future
cash flows, excite@home concluded that the asset group was impaired.

         excite@home  measured the  impairment  loss  related to impaired  asset
groups  based on the  amount by which  the  carrying  amount of the asset  group
exceeded the fair value of the asset group.  measurement of fair value was based
on an analysis by excite@home  utilizing the best  information  available in the
circumstances using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections,  and
including the discounted cash flow and market comparison  valuation  techniques.
the discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes
and was based on  excite@home's  best  estimate of projected  future cash flows,
including  terminal value cash flows expected to result from the  disposition of
the asset at the end of its useful life, discounted at our weighted average cost
of  capital.  weighted  average  cost of capital  was based on  historical  risk
premiums required by investors for companies of excite@home's size, industry and
capital structure and included risk factors specific to excite@home.  the market
comparison model represented  excite@home's  estimate of the prices that a buyer
would be  willing to pay  currently  for  similar  assets,  based on  comparable
products and services,  customer base,  risks,  earnings  capabilities and other
factors.
<page>

         based on the foregoing,  excite@home recorded an impairment  write-down
of $4,609 in the  aggregate,  which was allocated to each asset group based on a
comparison of carrying values and fair values. the impairment  write-down within
each asset group was allocated first to goodwill, and if goodwill was reduced to
zero, to identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.

         also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  at&amp;t;  recorded  a  goodwill  and
acquistion-related  impairment  charge  associated  with the  acquisition of our
investment in  excite@home.  the  write-down of our investment to fair value was
determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.

         since  we own  approximately  23%  of  excite@home,  77% of the  charge
recorded by  excite@home  was not  included as a reduction to at&amp;t;'s net income,
but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  consolidated  statement  of income as
"minority interest income (expense)."

         the $759 charge for  restructuring  and exit plans was primarily due to
headcount  reductions,  mainly in  network  operations  and  business  services,
including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
synergies created by the mediaone merger.

         included in exit costs was $503 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  approximately
6,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.

         we also  recorded $62 of network lease and other  contract  termination
costs  associated  with penalties  incurred as part of notifying  vendors of the
termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of $32 related to
the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergies created by the mediaone
merger.

         the  following   table  displays  the  activity  and  balances  of  the
restructuring reserve account:

         deductions reflect cash payments of $245, $209 and $369, for 1998, 1999
and 2000,  respectively.  these payments  included cash termination  benefits of
$124, $40 and $257, respectively,  which were primarily funded through cash from

<page>

operations.  deductions also reflect  noncash  utilization of $420, $43 and $170
for 1998, 1999 and 2000,  respectively.  noncash  utilization  included deferred
severance  payments  primarily related to executives,  and a reversal in 1998 of
$348  related  to the  1995  restructuring  plan.  nearly  75% of the  employees
affected by the 1999 and 2000 restructuring charges have left their positions as
of december 31, 2000.

         also  included  in  restructuring  and  exit  costs in 2000 was $144 of
benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part of
these exit plans. further, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related
to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  businesses  where the
carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.

         during 1999, we recorded $1,506 of net restructuring and other charges.

         a  $594  in-process   research  and  development  charge  was  recorded
reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at tci,
as of  the  date  of  acquisition,  which  had  not  yet  reached  technological
feasibility or had no alternative future use. the projects identified related to
efforts to offer voice over internet protocol (ip),  product-integration efforts
for advanced  set-top devices that would enable the offering of  next-generation
digital    services   and   cost-savings    efforts   for    broadband-telephony
implementation.  in addition,  excite@home had research and development  efforts
underway,  including projects to allow for  self-provisioning of devices and the
development  of  next-generation   client  software,   network  and  back-office
infrastructure to enable a variety of network devices beyond personal computers,
and improved  design for the regional  data  centers'  infrastructure.  we began
testing  ip-telephony  equipment  in  the  field  in  late-2000,  we  anticipate
beginning field trials for  next-generation  digital services in late-2001,  and
have   completed   trials   related  to  our  telephony   cost   reductions  and
implementation  has begun in certain markets.  although there are  technological
issues to overcome to successfully complete the acquired in-process research and
development,  we expect successful  completion.  if, however,  at&amp;t; is unable to
establish   technological    feasibility   and   produce   commercially   viable
products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.

         a $531 asset impairment charge was recorded in 1999 associated with the
planned disposal of certain wireless  communications  equipment resulting from a
program to increase  the  capacity  and  operating  efficiency  of our  wireless
network.  as part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
equipment in the western  united states and the  metropolitan  new york markets.
the program is intended to provide wireless  services with the newest technology
available  and allow it to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities.

         the planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure  equipment
required an  evaluation of asset  impairment in accordance  with sfas no. 121 to
write-down these assets to their fair value,  which was estimated by discounting
the  expected  future cash flows of these  assets  through the date of disposal.
since the assets will remain in service from the date of the decision to dispose
of these assets to the disposal date, the remaining net book value of the assets
will be  depreciated  over this period.  as of december 31, 2000,  approximately
$320 of the asset impairment reserve has been utilized for assets that have been
disposed of and written  off. the  remaining  net book value of these assets was
approximately  $23 at  december  31,  2000,  which will be  depreciated  over an
estimated remaining useful life of three months.
<page>

         also in 1999,  a $145  charge  for  restructuring  and exit  costs  was
recorded as part of at&amp;t;'s  initiative to reduce costs.  the  restructuring  and
exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
reductions  in  business   services  and  network   operations,   including  the
consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

         included in exit costs was $142 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  approximately
1,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.

         we also recorded net losses of $307 related to the  government-mandated
disposition  of  certain  international  businesses  that  would  have  competed
directly with concert,  and $50 related to a  contribution  agreement  broadband
entered into with phoenixstar, inc. that agreement requires broadband to satisfy
certain  liabilities owed by phoenixstar and its subsidiaries.  in addition,  we
recorded  benefits of $121 related to the settlement of pension  obligations for
former employees who accepted at&amp;t;'s 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program
(vrip) offer.

         during 1998, we recorded $2,514 of net restructuring and other charges.
the bulk of the charge was associated  with our overall  cost-reduction  program
and the approximately 15,300 management employees who accepted the vrip offer. a
restructuring  charge of $2,724 was  composed of $2,254 and $169 for pension and
postretirement  special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 of benefit plan
curtailment  losses  and $38 of other  administrative  costs.  we also  recorded
charges of $125 for  related  facility  costs and $150 for  executive-separation
costs.  these  charges were  partially  offset by benefits of $940 as we settled
pension benefit obligations of 13,700 of the total vrip employees.  in addition,
the vrip charges were partially  offset by the reversal of $256 of 1995 business
restructuring  reserves primarily  resulting from the overlap of vrip on certain
1995 projects.

         also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718,  of which  $633 was  related  to our
decision not to pursue total service resale (tsr) as a  local-service  strategy.
we also recorded an $85 asset  impairment  charge  related to the  write-down of
unrecoverable  assets in certain  international  operations  where the  carrying
value was no longer  supported  by future  cash  flows.  this charge was made in
connection  with the review of  certain  operations  that  would  have  competed
directly with concert.

         additionally,  $85 of  merger-related  expenses was recorded in 1998 in
connection  with  the tcg  merger,  which  was  accounted  for as a  pooling  of
interests.  partially  offsetting  these  charges was a $92 reversal of the 1995
restructuring  reserve.  this  reversal  reflected  reserves  no  longer  deemed
necessary.  the reversal  primarily  included  separation  costs  attributed  to
projects completed at a cost lower than originally anticipated.  consistent with
the  three-year  plan, the 1995  restructuring  initiatives  were  substantially
completed by the end of 1998.

         during 2000 and 1999,  certain  investees of liberty media group issued
common  stock.  changes in the equity of the  investees,  net of the dilution of
lmg's ownership  interest,  resulted in an increase to at&amp;t;'s additional paid-in
capital of $355 and $109 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

9.  other investments

         we have  investments  in various  companies and  partnerships  that are
accounted for under the equity method and included within "other investments and
related  advances" in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets.  under the
equity  method,  investments  are stated at initial  cost,  and are adjusted for
subsequent contributions and our share of earnings, losses and distributions. at
december  31,  2000 and 1999,  we had  equity  investments  (other  than lmg) of
$13,624 and  $18,454,  respectively.  the  carrying  value of these  investments
exceeded our share of the underlying reported net assets by approximately $8,720
and $12,530, at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  the goodwill is being
amortized  over periods  ranging  from 15 to 40 years.  pretax  amortization  of
goodwill was $571,  $495,  and $52 in 2000,  1999, and 1998,  respectively.  the
amortization  is shown net of income  taxes as a  component  of "net losses from
other equity investments" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
distributions from equity investments totaled $214, $317 and $360, for the years
ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(a)      at  december  31,  2000  and  1999,  we  owned  48,942,172   shares  of
         cablevision  systems  corporation  class a common  stock,  which  had a
         closing market price of $84.94 and $75.50 per share,  respectively,  on
         those dates. cablevision systems corporation (cablevision) redeemed all
         of its outstanding  preferred stock and issued additional common stock,
         and issued shares of its common stock for acquisitions.  as a result of
         these transactions,  at&amp;t;'s ownership interest in cablevision decreased
         from 32.04% to 27.98%. due to the dilution of at&amp;t;'s ownership interest
         in  cablevision,  net of the  increase in  cablevision's  equity,  at&amp;t;
         recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of $170 in 2000.

(b)      on january 5, 2000, we formed concert, our  global-communications joint
         venture with bt.

(c)      at december 31, 2000, we owned  18,900,000  shares of  net2phone,  inc.
         class a common  stock,  which had a closing  market  price of $7.38 per
         share on that date.

(d)      this investment is accounted for under the equity method because of our
         ability  to elect  certain  members of the board of  directors  of this
         entity, which we believe provides us with significant influence.

(e)      on december 29,  2000,  ab cellular  completed  the  redemption  of our
         equity interest in ab cellular.  voting interest in ab cellular was 50%
         at december 31, 1999.

(f)      on  august 28,  2000,  at&amp;t; and  excite@home  announced  the closing of
         their extension contracts and governance reorganization. as a result of
         the governance  changes,  at&amp;t; gained a controlling  interest and began
         consolidating  excite@home's  results  on  september  1,  2000.  as  of
         december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
         74% voting interest in  excite@home.  we owned 7,924,422 and 63,720,000

<page>

         shares of  excite@home  class a common  stock at december  31, 2000 and
         1999, respectively, which had closing market prices of $5.53 and $42.88
         per share,  respectively,  on those dates. we also owned 86,595,578 and
         30,800,000  shares of excite@home  class b common stock at december 31,
         2000 and 1999, respectively, which are not publicly traded. during 2000
         and 1999,  excite@home  issued  shares of its common  stock for various
         acquisitions.  as a  result  of  these  transactions,  at&amp;t;'s  economic
         interest in excite@home decreased from 25% to 23% in 2000, and from 38%
         to  25%  in  1999,  respectively.  due to  the  resulting  increase  in
         excite@home's  equity, net of the dilution of at&amp;t;'s ownership interest
         in excite@home, at&amp;t; recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital
         of $116 and $527 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         in february  2000,  we entered into a 364-day,  $10 billion  syndicated
credit facility upon the expiration of existing credit  facilities.  on december
28, 2000, we entered into a new 364-day,  $25 billion credit facility syndicated
to 39 banks.  as a result,  the  outstanding  $10 billion  credit  facility  was
terminated.  the credit facility is for commercial  paper back-up and was unused
at  december  31,  2000.  the credit  facility  agreement  contains a  financial
covenant that requires at&amp;t; to maintain a net  debt-to-ebitda  ratio (as defined
in the  credit  agreement)  not  exceeding  3.00 to 1.00  for  four  consecutive
quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter. at december 31, 2000, we
were in compliance with this covenant.

         at december 31,  1999,  we had a 364-day,  $7 billion  revolving-credit
facility  with a  consortium  of 42  lenders.  we also had  additional  364-day,
revolving-credit facilities of $3 billion. these lines were for commercial paper
back-up and were unused at december 31, 1999.

(a)      included in these balances was $946 and $975 representing the remaining
         excess of the fair value over the recorded  value of debt in connection
         with the tci and mediaone mergers at december 31, 2000 and december 31,
         1999,  respectively.  the excess is being  amortized over the remaining
         lives of the underlying debt obligations.

(b)      the actual interest paid on our debt obligations may have differed from
         the stated amount due to our entering into interest rate swap contracts
         to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and our strategy to reduce
         finance costs (see note 12).

         on january 26, 1999,  at&amp;t; filed a registration  statement with the sec
for the offering and sale of up to $10 billion of notes and warrants to purchase
notes,  resulting in a total available shelf  registration of $13.1 billion.  on
march 26,  1999,  at&amp;t; issued $8 billion in notes.  we received  net proceeds of
approximately  $7.9  billion  from  the sale of the  notes.  the  proceeds  were
utilized to repay  commercial paper issued in connection with the tci merger and
toward  funding the share  repurchase  program.  on  september  14,  1999,  at&amp;t;
completed  a $450  bond  offering  in  connection  with  the  same  registration
statement.  the proceeds from the issuance  were utilized for general  corporate
purposes.

preferred  securities  and  investing  the proceeds  thereof  into  subordinated
deferrable   interest  notes   (subordinated   debt   securities)  of  tci.  the
subordinated  debt  securities have interest rates equal to the interest rate of
the  corresponding  trust  preferred  securities and have maturity dates ranging
from 30 to 49 years from the date of  issuance.  the  preferred  securities  are
mandatorily  redeemable upon repayment of the subordinated debt securities,  and
are callable by at&amp;t.;  the  financing i and ii trust  preferred  securities  are
callable  at  face  value  beginning  in  january  and may  2001,  respectively.

         at maturity, the exchangeable notes will be redeemed, at at&amp;t;'s option,
with (i) a number of shares of  comcast  common  stock  equal to the  underlying
shares  multiplied by the exchange ratio, or (ii) its equivalent cash value. the
exchange ratio will be calculated at maturity in the following manner:

         (a)      if the fair market value of a share of comcast common stock is
                  greater than or equal to the call price,  the  exchange  ratio
                  will be a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the sum

                  value of a share of comcast  common stock over the call price,
                  and the denominator of which is equal to the fair market value
                  of a share of comcast common stock;

         (b)      if the fair market  value of  a share of comcast  common stock
                  is less than or equal to the put  price,  the  exchange  ratio
                  will be 1;

         (c)      if the fair market value of a share of comcast common stock is
                  less than the call price but greater  than the put price,  the
                  exchange  ratio will be a fraction,  the numerator of which is
                  equal to the put price,  and the denominator of which is equal
                  to the fair market value of a share of comcast common stock.

         the  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2001 are indexed to 29 million
vodafone adrs,  and will be exchanged at maturity based upon a redemption  value
of $9.00 in cash  plus  21/2  times  the fair  market  value of a  vodafone  adr
(maturity price), as follows:

                  (a) if the  maturity  price is greater  than or equal to $9.00
         plus 21/2  times the call price per share,  each  exchangeable  note is
         equivalent to 0.8101 of the maturity price;

                  (b) if the maturity  price is less than or equal to $9.00 plus
         21/2  times  the  put  price  per  share,  each  exchangeable  note  is
         equivalent to the maturity price; or

                  (c) if the  maturity  price is less than  $71.75 per share but
         greater than $58.125 per share, each exchangeable note is equivalent to
         $58.125.

         the  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2002 are indexed to 26 million
vodafone adrs, and will be exchanged at maturity as follows:

                  (a) if the fair market value of a vodafone adr is greater than
         or equal to the call price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to
         0.8475 of a vodafone adr;

                  (b) if the fair market value of a vodafone adr is less than or
         equal to the put price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to one
         vodafone adr; or

                  (c) if the fair  market  value of a vodafone  adr is less than
         the call price but greater than the put price,  each  exchangeable note
         is  equivalent  to a fraction  of a  vodafone  adr equal to (i) the put
         price divided by (ii) the fair market value of a vodafone adr.

         the  exchangeable  notes  are  being  accounted  for  as  indexed  debt
instruments  since the  maturity  value of the debt is  dependent  upon the fair
market value of the underlying comcast,  microsoft and vodafone securities.  the
exchangeable  notes  contain  embedded  options  that hedge the market risk of a
decline in value of comcast,  microsoft and vodafone securities. the market risk
of a decline in comcast  and  microsoft  stock,  and  vodafone  adrs,  below the
respective put prices has been eliminated.  in addition, any market gains we may
earn have been  limited to the call prices,  with the  exception of certain debt
indexed  to  comcast  stock and the debt  indexed to the  vodafone  adrs,  which
provides for our  participation  in a portion of the market gains above the call
price.

         since the comcast,  microsoft,  and vodafone securities are cost method
investments  being accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities under sfas
no. 115,  "accounting  for certain  investments in debt and equity  securities,"
changes  in the  maturity  value of the  exchangeable  notes and the  underlying
securities  are being  recorded  as  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income
taxes, within other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity.

         the  exchangeable  notes indexed to comcast  common stock and microsoft
common stock are secured by the comcast and microsoft investments at&amp;t; owns. the
exchangeable notes indexed to vodafone adrs are unsecured  obligations,  ranking
equally  in right  of  payment  with  all  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated
obligations of at&amp;t.;

other exchangeable debt

         during 2000, we entered into a series of purchased and written  options
on 21.9 million shares of microsoft common stock, and issued floating rate debt.
the  carrying  value of the debt at december 31,  2000,  was $1,369,  which pays
interest at the three-month  london  inter-bank  offered rate (libor) plus 0.4%.
the debt matures annually with $458 maturing in 2003 and 2004, and $453 maturing
in 2005, and is repayable at at&amp;t;'s option in either microsoft stock or cash.

         in addition, during 1999 two subsidiaries of mediaone,  mediaone spc iv
and mediaone spc vi,  entered into a series of purchased and written  options on
vodafone adrs  contributed to them by mediaone,  and issued  floating rate debt.
the  carrying  value of the debt at december 31,  2000,  was $1,739,  which pays
interest  at the  three-month  libor  plus  0.5%.  this  debt  matures  in equal
quarterly  installments  beginning  in 2003 and  ending in 2005.  the  assets of
mediaone spc iv, which are primarily  29.1 million  vodafone adrs, are available
only to pay the creditors of mediaone spc iv.  likewise,  the assets of mediaone

preferred stock of subsidiaries

         prior to the tci merger,  tci  pacific  communications  inc.  (pacific)
issued 5% class a senior cumulative  exchangeable preferred stock, which remains
outstanding.  there  were 6.3  million  shares  authorized  and  outstanding  at
december 31, 2000 and 1999. each share is exchangeable, from and after august 1,
2001,  for  approximately  6.3 shares of at&amp;t; common  stock,  subject to certain
antidilution adjustments.  additionally, pacific may elect to make any dividend,
redemption  or  liquidation  payment in cash,  shares of at&amp;t; common  stock or a
combination of the foregoing.  the pacific  preferred stock is reflected  within
"minority  interest"  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets,  and
aggregated $2.1 billion at december 31, 2000 and 1999.
<page>

         prior to the tci merger,  tci issued class b 6%  cumulative  redeemable
exchangeable  junior preferred stock (class b preferred  stock).  there were 1.6
million  shares  outstanding  as of december 31,  1999,  net of shares held by a
subsidiary, out of an authorized 1.7 million shares. class b preferred stock and
accumulated  dividends  aggregated $152 at december 31, 1999, and were reflected
within "minority interest" in the accompanying 1999 consolidated  balance sheet.
on february 22, 2000,  all  outstanding  shares of class b preferred  stock were
redeemed at $105.88 per share.

company-obligated   convertible   quarterly  income   preferred   securities  of
subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of at&amp;t; and related
warrants

         on june 16, 1999,  at&amp;t; finance  trust i (at&amp;t;  trust),  a wholly owned
subsidiary  of at&amp;t;,  completed  the private sale of 100 million  shares of 5.0%
cumulative   quarterly  income   preferred   securities   (quarterly   preferred
securities)  to  microsoft.  proceeds of the issuance  were invested by the at&amp;t;
trust in junior  subordinated  debentures  (debentures) issued by at&amp;t; due 2029,
which represent the sole asset of the at&amp;t; trust.

         the quarterly  preferred  securities pay dividends at an annual rate of
5.0% of the liquidation  preference of $50 per security,  and are convertible at
any time prior to maturity into 66.667 million shares of at&amp;t; common stock.  the
quarterly  preferred   securities  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon
repayment  of the  debentures  at  maturity  or their  earlier  redemption.  the
conversion  feature can be  terminated,  under certain  conditions,  after three
years.

         the debentures  will make a quarterly  payment in arrears of 62.5 cents
per  security on the last day of march,  june,  september  and  december of each
year.  at&amp;t; has the right to defer such interest  payments up to 20  consecutive
quarters.  as a  consequence,  quarterly  dividend  payments  on  the  quarterly
preferred  securities  can be  deferred  by  the  at&amp;t;  trust  during  any  such
interest-payment period. if at&amp;t; defers any interest payments, we may not, among
other  things,  pay any  dividends  on our common  stock  until all  interest in
arrears is paid to the at&amp;t; trust.

         dividends on the quarterly preferred  securities were $250 and $135 for
the years ended  december  31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and are  reported
within "minority  interest income  (expense)" in the  accompanying  consolidated
statements of income.

         on june 16, 1999,  at&amp;t; also issued to  microsoft 40 million  warrants,
each to purchase  one share of at&amp;t; common  stock at a price of $75 per share at
the end of  three  years.  alternatively,  the  warrants  are  exercisable  on a
cashless basis. if the warrants are not exercised on the three-year  anniversary
of the closing date, the warrants expire.

         a discount on the quarterly preferred  securities equal to the value of
the warrants of $306 was recognized and is being amortized over the 30-year life
of the  quarterly  preferred  securities  as a component of  "minority  interest
income (expense)" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

centaur funding corporation

         centaur funding corporation (centaur), a subsidiary of mediaone, issued
three  series of  preferred  shares  prior to at&amp;t;'s  acquisition  of  mediaone.
centaur was created for the  principal  purpose of raising  capital  through the

<page>

issuance of preferred  shares and investing  those proceeds into notes issued by
mediaone spc ii, a subsidiary of mediaone.  principal and interest payments from
the notes are expected to be centaur's  primary source of funds to make dividend
and redemption  payments on the preferred shares. in addition,  the dividend and
certain  redemption  payments  on the  preferred  shares will be  determined  by
reference to the  dividend and  redemption  activity of the  preferred  stock of
airtouch communications,  inc. (ati shares) held by mediaone spc ii. payments on
the preferred shares are neither guaranteed nor secured by mediaone or at&amp;t.; the
assets of mediaone spc ii, which include the ati shares,  are available  only to
pay the creditors of mediaone spc ii. these securities  remained  outstanding at
december 31, 2000 as follows:

12.  financial instruments

         in the normal course of business, we use various financial instruments,
including derivative financial instruments,  for purposes other than trading. we
do not use derivative  financial  instruments  for speculative  purposes.  these
instruments  include letters of credit,  guarantees of debt,  interest rate swap
agreements,  foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  option contracts and equity
hedges. collateral is generally not required for these types of instruments.

         by their  nature,  all such  instruments  involve  risk,  including the
credit risk of nonperformance by counterparties,  and our maximum potential loss
may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet.  however, at december 31,
2000 and 1999, in management's opinion, there was no significant risk of loss in
the  event  of   nonperformance   of  the   counterparties  to  these  financial
instruments.  we control our exposure to credit risk through  credit  approvals,
credit limits and monitoring procedures. we do not have any significant exposure
to  any  individual  customer  or  counterparty,   nor  do  we  have  any  major
concentration of credit risk related to any financial instruments.
<page>

letters of credit

         letters of credit are purchased  guarantees that ensure our performance
or payment to third parties in accordance  with specified  terms and conditions.
letters of credit do not create any additional risk to at&amp;t.;

guarantees of debt

         from  time to  time,  we  guarantee  the debt of our  subsidiaries  and
certain  unconsolidated  joint ventures.  prior to the merger, tci had agreed to
take  certain  steps to support  debt  compliance  with  respect to  obligations
aggregating  $1,461 and $1,720 at december 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  of
certain  cable  television  partnerships  in  which  tci  has a  non-controlling
ownership interest. although there can be no assurance, management believes that
it  will  not be  required  to  meet  its  obligations  under  such  guarantees.
additionally,  in connection with the  restructuring  of at&amp;t; in 1996, we issued
guarantees for certain debt obligations of our former  subsidiaries at&amp;t; capital
corp. and ncr. the amount of guaranteed  debt associated with at&amp;t; capital corp.
and ncr was $48 and $56 at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

interest rate swap agreements

         we enter into  interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in
interest  rates and to lower our overall costs of financing.  we enter into swap
agreements to manage the  fixed/floating  mix of our debt  portfolio in order to
reduce aggregate risk to interest rate movements. interest rate swaps also allow
us to raise funds at floating rates and  effectively  swap them into fixed rates
that are lower than those  available to us if  fixed-rate  borrowings  were made
directly.  these agreements involve the exchange of floating-rate for fixed-rate
payments,  fixed-rate  for  floating-rate  payments or  floating-rate  for other
floating-rate  payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount.
fixed  interest rate  payments at december 31, 2000,  were at rates ranging from
6.05% to 8.20%.  floating-rate payments are based on rates tied to the libor. in
addition,  we also have combined interest rate, foreign currency swap agreements
for  foreign-currency-denominated  debt,  which hedge our risk to both  interest
rate and currency movements.

         the following table indicates the types of swaps in use at december 31,
2000 and 1999, and their weighted-average interest rates. average variable rates
are those in effect at the reporting date and may change  significantly over the
lives of the contracts.

foreign exchange

         we enter into foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  including forward
and option  contracts,  to manage our  exposure to changes in currency  exchange
rates  related  to  foreign-currency-denominated  transactions.  in  2000,  this
consisted  principally  of brazilian  reais and swiss francs related to debt. in
1999,  this consisted  principally of european  union currency  (euro),  british
pounds  sterling and  japanese yen  contracts  related to the  reimbursement  to
foreign telephone  companies for their portion of the revenue billed by at&amp;t; for
calls  placed  in the  united  states  to a foreign  country  and other  foreign
currency  payables  and  receivables.  in  addition,  we are  subject to foreign
exchange risk related to other foreign-currency-denominated transactions.

collars

         we enter into option  agreements  to hedge our exposure on debt that is
indexed to securities we own. during 2000, we entered into a series of purchased
and written  options  related to a portion of our  holdings in  microsoft  stock
(microsoft collar),  which is indexed to floating rate debt. the collar has been
designated  and is effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment in microsoft  stock.  the microsoft  collar is carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the microsoft  stock.  the carrying value of the
microsoft collar was $419 at december 31, 2000.

         at the expiration of the microsoft  collar, if the price of a microsoft
share is equal to or less than the put price of $62.48,  we would  exercise  the
put option and deliver  all  underlying  shares of  microsoft  common  stock and
receive  cash  equal  in  value  to (i) the put  price,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  alternatively,  at our  option,  we can elect not to
deliver the  underlying  shares and instead  settle the put option by  receiving
cash equal in value to the (i) the  difference  between  the put price minus the
fair value of one  microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the  underlying  share
amount. if the price of a microsoft share is greater then the call price,  which
range from $86.26 to $118.36,  then the call option  would be  exercised  and we
would deliver all  underlying  shares and receive cash equal in value to (i) the
call price,  multiplied by (ii) the underlying share amount.  at our option,  we
can elect not to  deliver  the  underlying  shares and  instead  settle the call
option by paying cash equal in value to the (i) the difference  between the call
price  minus  the fair  value of one  microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  any  cash  received  by at&amp;t;  from the  exercise  or
settlement  of either put or call  option  would be used to retire the  floating
rate debt.  we would  retain cash in excess of the call price from a call option
exercise.  if the price of a  microsoft  share is between  the put price and the
call price, the collar will expire without value.

         prior to our  merger  with  mediaone,  two  subsidiaries  of  mediaone,
mediaone  spc iv and mediaone  spc vi,  entered  into a series of purchased  and
written  options  (vodafone  collars) on vodafone  adrs  contributed  to them by
mediaone,  and  issued  floating  rate  debt.  the  vodafone  collars  have been
designated and are effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment  in vodafone  adrs.  the vodafone  collars are carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the vodafone  adrs.  the  carrying  value of the
vodafone collars was $453 at december 31, 2000.

         at the  expiration of the mediaone spc iv collar,  we will receive cash
if the market  value of a  vodafone  adr is less than  approximately  $34.00 per
share,  effectively  eliminating  downside  risk on the stock  below  $34.00 per
share.  conversely,  if the  market  value of a  vodafone  adr is  greater  than
approximately  $49.00 per share, we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
offset by the  corresponding  increase in the value of the  vodafone  adr.  this
vodafone collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005.

         at the  expiration of the mediaone spc vi collar,  we will receive cash

fair values of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments

         the  following  table  summarizes  the  notional  amounts  of  material
financial  instruments.  the notional amounts represent  agreed-upon  amounts on
which  calculations of dollars to be exchanged are based.  they do not represent
amounts  exchanged  by the  parties  and,  therefore,  are not a measure  of our
exposure.  our  exposure  is limited to the fair value of the  contracts  with a
positive fair value plus interest receivable, if any, at the reporting date.

13.  pension, postretirement and other employee benefit plans

         we sponsor noncontributory,  defined benefit pension plans covering the
majority of our employees.  pension benefits for management  employees are based
principally on career-average  pay. pension benefits for occupational  employees
are not directly related to pay. pension trust  contributions  are made to trust
funds held for the sole  benefit of plan  participants.  our  benefit  plans for
current and certain future retirees include health-care benefits, life insurance
coverage and telephone concessions.

*        primarily  included  in "net  restructuring  and other  charges" in the
         consolidated statements of income.

         on january  26,  1998,  we  offered a  voluntary  retirement  incentive
program  (vrip)  to  employees  who  were  eligible  participants  in  the  at&amp;t;
management pension plan.  approximately 15,300 management employees accepted the
vrip offer.  in connection with the vrip, we recorded pretax charges in 1998 for
pension and postretirement plan special-termination benefits of $2,254 and $169,
respectively. we also recorded pension and postretirement plan pretax charges of
$120 and $143, respectively, which are included within net curtailment losses in
1998.  the  special-termination  benefits  reflect the value of pension  benefit
improvements and expanded eligibility for postretirement benefits. the vrip also
permitted  employees to choose  either a total  lump-sum  distribution  of their
pension benefits or periodic future annuity payments.

         as of december 31, 1999, all 15,300 employees had terminated employment
under the vrip. at&amp;t; has settled the pension  obligations  covering about 15,100
of these  employees,  the  remainder of which  either chose to defer  commencing
their pension benefits or elected to receive an annuity  distribution.  lump-sum
pension  settlements   totaling  $5.2  billion,   including  a  portion  of  the
special-pension  termination benefits referred to above,  resulted in settlement
gains of $121 and $940 recorded in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         our  nonqualified  pension  plans had an unfunded  accumulated  benefit
obligation  of $125 and $118 at december  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  our
postretirement  health and telephone  concession  benefit plans had  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations of $4,282 and $4,021 at december 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively,  which were in excess of plan assets of $1,413 and $1,635 at
december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         the   assumptions   used  in  the   measurement   of  the  pension  and
postretirement benefit obligations are shown in the following table:

         we  assumed  a rate of  increase  in the  per  capita  cost of  covered
health-care  benefits (the  health-care  cost trend rate) of 7.6%. this rate was
assumed to gradually  decline  after 2000 to 4.5% by 2010 and then remain level.
assumed  health-care  cost trend rates have a significant  effect on the amounts
reported for the health-care  plans. a one percentage point increase or decrease
in the assumed  health-care cost trend rate would increase or decrease the total
of the service  and  interest-cost  components  of net  periodic  postretirement
health-care  benefit  cost by $9 and $9,  respectively,  and would  increase  or
decrease the  health-care  component of the accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation by $125 and $122, respectively.

         we also sponsor  savings plans for the majority of our  employees.  the
plans allow  employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and/or  after-tax
income in accordance  with  specified  guidelines.  we match a percentage of the
employee  contributions up to certain limits. our contributions amounted to $280
in 2000, $234 in 1999 and $204 in 1998.

14.  stock-based compensation plans

         under  the  1997  long-term  incentive  program  (program),  which  was
effective june 1, 1997, and amended on may 19, 1999 and march 14, 2000, we grant
stock options,  performance  shares,  restricted  stock and other awards on at&amp;t;
common stock as well as stock options on at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.

         under the program,  there were 150 million  shares of at&amp;t; common stock
available  for grant with a maximum of 22.5 million  common shares that could be
used for awards other than stock  options.  beginning  with january 1, 2000, the
remaining  shares  available  for grant at december  31 of the prior year,  plus
1.75% of the shares of at&amp;t; common stock  outstanding on january 1 of each year,
become available for grant.  there are a maximum of 37.5 million shares that may
be used for awards other than stock  options.  the  exercise  price of any stock
option is equal to the stock  price when the option is granted.  generally,  the
options  vest over three or four years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from
the date of grant.

         under the program, performance share units are awarded to key employees
in the form of either  common stock or cash at the end of a  three-year  period,
based on at&amp;t;'s  total  shareholder  return  and  certain  financial-performance
targets.  under the 1987 long-term  incentive  program,  performance share units
with  the same  terms  were  also  awarded  to key  employees  based  on  at&amp;t;'s
return-to-equity performance compared with a target.
<page>

         on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; created a new class of stock and  completed an
offering of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock.  under the program,  5% of the
outstanding at&amp;t; wireless group shares became available for grant with a maximum
of 1.25% of the  outstanding  shares  that may be used  for  awards  other  than
options.  beginning  with january 1, 2001,  the remaining  at&amp;t;  wireless  group
shares  available  for grant at december  31 of the prior  year,  plus 2% of the
outstanding  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  shares  on  january 1 of each  year,  become
available  for grant.  the  exercise  price of any stock  option is equal to the
stock price when the option is granted.  generally, the options vest over two to
three and  one-half  years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from the date of
grant.  in 2000,  there were no grants of awards  other than stock  options.  on
april 27, 2000,  substantially  all employees  were granted at&amp;t; wireless  group
tracking stock options.

         under the at&amp;t; 1996  employee  stock  purchase  plan (plan),  which was
effective  july 1, 1996, we are  authorized  to sell up to 75 million  shares of
at&amp;t;  common  stock to our  eligible  employees.  under  the  terms of the plan,
employees  may have up to 10% of their  earnings  withheld  to  purchase  at&amp;t;'s
common stock.  the purchase price of the stock on the date of exercise is 85% of
the average  high and low sale  prices of shares on the new york stock  exchange
for that  day.  under  the  plan,  we sold  approximately  6  million  shares to
employees in 2000 and 3 million shares to employees in both 1999 and 1998.

         we  apply  apb  opinion  no.  25,   "accounting  for  stock  issued  to
employees,"   and  related   interpretations   in  accounting   for  our  plans.
accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for our stock-based
compensation  plans other than for our  performance-based  and restricted  stock
awards and stock appreciation  rights (sars).  stock  based-compensation  income
(expense)  was $253,  $(462)  and $(157) in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.
these  amounts  included  income  (expense) of $269 and $(382) in 2000 and 1999,
respectively,  related to grants of sars of affiliated companies held by certain
employees  subsequent to the tci merger. we also entered into an equity hedge in
1999 to offset potential future  compensation  costs associated with these sars.
(expense)  income  related  to this  hedge was $(297) and $247 in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

         the pro forma  effect on net income for 1998 may not be  representative
of the pro forma effect on net income of future  years  because the sfas no. 123
method of accounting for pro forma compensation  expense has not been applied to

         the weighted-average fair values at date of grant for at&amp;t; common stock
options  granted  during  2000,  1999 and 1998 were  $12.10,  $15.64  and $9.75,

the  weighted-average  risk-free  interest rates applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998
were  6.29%,  5.10% and 5.33%,  respectively.  the  following  assumptions  were
applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively:  (i) expected dividend yields of
1.6%, 1.7% and 2.1%, (ii) expected  volatility  rates of 33.5%,  28.3% and 23.8%

         in addition,  we also recorded current and deferred income tax expenses
(benefits)  related to minority  interest and net equity  losses on other equity
investments  in the  amounts of $(154)  and $(125) in 2000,  $(94) and $(344) in
1999 and $143 and $(120) in 1998, respectively.

         deferred  income tax  liabilities  are taxes we expect to pay in future
periods.  similarly,  deferred  income  tax  assets are  recorded  for  expected
reductions  in taxes  payable in future  periods.  deferred  income  taxes arise
because  of  differences  in the  book  and tax  bases  of  certain  assets  and
liabilities.

         at  december  31,  2000,  we  had  net  operating  loss   carryforwards
(tax-effected), excluding excite@home, for federal and state income tax purposes
of $79 and $164,  respectively,  expiring  through  2015.  in  addition,  we had
federal tax credit  carryforwards  of $145, of which $64 have no expiration date
and $81  expire  through  2005.  we also  had  state  tax  credit  carryforwards
(tax-effected)  of $32 expiring through 2003. in connection with the tci merger,
we acquired certain federal and state net operating loss  carryforwards  subject
to a valuation  allowance of $59. if, in the future,  the  realization  of these
acquired  deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not, any reduction of the
associated  valuation  allowance will be allocated to reduce franchise costs and
other purchased intangibles.
<page>

         at december 31, 2000,  excite@home had net operating loss carryforwards
(tax  effected)  for federal  and state  income tax  purposes  of $290  expiring
through 2020.  utilization of excite@home's net operating loss carryforwards may
be subject to a minor annual limitation due to the ownership change  limitations
provided by the internal  revenue code of 1986,  as amended,  and similar  state
provisions.  the annual  limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of
excite@home's  net  operating  loss  carryforwards   before   utilization.   the
realization  of   excite@home's   net  deferred  tax  asset  is  dependent  upon
excite@home's  future  earnings,  if any,  the  timing  and  amount of which are
uncertain.  in addition,  excite@home is a separate taxpayer and is not a member
of  the  at&amp;t;  consolidated  tax  group.  accordingly,  excite@home  provided  a
valuation allowance in an amount equal to its net deferred tax assets of $702 as
of december 31, 2000. approximately $142 of excite@home's valuation allowance at
december 31, 2000, is  attributable to stock option  deductions,  the benefit of
which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized.  approximately  $269 of
excite@home's  valuation  allowance  at december 31, 2000,  is  attributable  to
deferred  tax assets  that,  if  realized,  will be  allocated  to first  reduce
goodwill, then other purchased intangibles, and then income tax expense.

         on november 15, 2000, we announced our intention to split-off  lmg. the
split-off  of  lmg  remains  subject  to the  receipt  of  necessary  approvals,
including a  favorable  tax ruling  from the irs.  pursuant  to the  tax-sharing
agreement  dated  march  9,  1999  between  at&amp;t; and lmg,  in the  event  lmg is
split-off,  at&amp;t; would be required to reimburse lmg  approximately  $830 for the
value of certain tci pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards.  also, in
connection  with a tax-sharing  agreement  between lmg and tci that was executed
prior  to  at&amp;t;'s  acquisition  of tci,  lmg  would  be  obligated  to pay  at&amp;t;
approximately $138 upon its split-off from at&amp;t.;

16.  commitments and contingencies

         in the  normal  course  of  business  we are  subject  to  proceedings,
lawsuits and other  claims,  including  proceedings  under laws and  regulations
related to  environmental  and other  matters.  such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. consequently, we
are unable to ascertain the ultimate  aggregate amount of monetary  liability or
financial  impact with  respect to these  matters at december  31,  2000.  these
matters could affect the  operating  results of any one quarter when resolved in
future periods.  however, we believe that after final disposition,  any monetary
liability or financial  impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end  would
not be material to our annual consolidated financial statements.

         we lease land, buildings and equipment through contracts that expire in
various years through 2037. our rental expense under  operating  leases was $980
in 2000,  $827 in 1999 and $742 in 1998.  the  total of  minimum  rentals  to be
received in the future under  noncancelable  operating  subleases as of december
31, 2000, was $209.

noncancelable operating and capital leases at december 31, 2000:

         at&amp;t; has an agreement with motorola, inc. to purchase a minimum of 1.25
million  digital  set-top  devices at an average price of $248 per unit in 2001.
during 2000,  at&amp;t;  satisfied its  obligation  under a previous  agreement  with
motorola, inc. to purchase set-top devices.

         at&amp;t; has entered into various purchase commitments for wireless network
equipment and handsets.  the  commitments  totaled $432 as of december 31, 2000,
and extend through 2004.

         at&amp;t; has  committed  to provide  funding to a joint  venture with other
investors,  alaska native wireless  (anw),  which was formed in november 2000 to
participate in the federal  communication  commission's  recent license spectrum
auction.  the  auction  was  concluded  in january  2001 and anw was the highest
bidder on  approximately  $2.9 billion in licenses.  at&amp;t; has  committed to fund
approximately  $2.6  billion  to anw to fund  anw's  purchase  of  licenses.  at
december  31,  2000,  at&amp;t; had  provided  approximately  $229 of funding and has
committed to provide additional funding of approximately $2.4 billion consisting
primarily of debt securities of anw. at the fifth  anniversary of the first date
on which  licenses  are granted to anw,  the other  owners of anw have rights to
require at&amp;t; to purchase  their equity  interests.  if such rights are exercised
five  years  after  the  license  grant  date,   the  purchase  price  would  be
approximately  $950 and would be  payable,  at our  option,  in  either  cash or
marketable  securities.  in the event that these rights are exercised before the
fifth anniversary,  or in the event that the winning bid is rejected,  or if any
licenses granted to anw are revoked or challenged, the amount that at&amp;t; would be
required to pay would be less than $950.

         through a joint  venture (70% owned by at&amp;t; and 30% owned by bt),  at&amp;t;
and bt have a 31%  ownership of at&amp;t; canada corp. as a result of the 1999 merger
between at&amp;t; canada corp. and metronet communications,  corp. in connection with
this merger, the at&amp;t; and bt joint venture has the right to call, or arrange for
another  entity to call,  the  remaining  69% of at&amp;t;  canada for the greater of
cdn$40.56 per share,  which  represented  the projected value as of december 31,
2000,  with an accretion of 4% each quarter that began on june 30, 2000,  or the
then-appraised  fair market value. if we do not exercise our call rights by june
30,  2003,  the shares  would be put up for  auction,  and the at&amp;t; and bt joint
venture would have to make the shareholders whole for the difference between the
proceeds  received in auction  and the  greater of the fair market  value or the
accreted  value.  the exact  timing of any  purchase  will  likely be  partially
dependent upon the future status of canadian foreign-ownership regulations.

17.  related party transactions

         at&amp;t; has various related party transactions with concert as a result of
the closure of this global venture in early january 2000.

         included in revenue for the year ended  december 31,  2000,  is $1,080,
for services provided to concert.

         included  in access and other  connection  expenses  for the year ended

behalf to connect calls made to foreign  countries  (international  settlements)
and costs paid by at&amp;t; to concert for  distributing  concert  products  totaling
$2,364.

         during the first quarter of 2000, at&amp;t; contributed property,  plant and
equipment  of  approximately  $1,600  to  concert.  at&amp;t; also  loaned  $1,000 to
concert;  that loan is included within "other  investments and related advances"
in the accompanying 2000 consolidated balance sheet.  interest income of $67 was
recognized for the year ended december 31, 2000.

         at december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had a floating rate loan payable to concert
in the amount of $126.  the loan,  which is due on demand,  is included in "debt
maturing  within  one  year" in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet.
interest expense was $6 for the year ended december 31, 2000.

         included in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable at december 31,
2000, was $462 and $518,  respectively,  related to  transactions  with concert.
included in other  receivables  and other  current  liabilities  at december 31,
2000, was $1,106 and $1,032,  respectively,  related to transactions  associated
with concert.

         in  addition,  we had  various  related  party  transactions  with lmg.
included in costs of services and products were programming  expenses related to
services from lmg. these  expenses  amounted to $239 for the year ended december
31, 2000 and $184 for the 10 months ended december 31, 1999, respectively.

         included in "investment in liberty media group and related receivables,
net" was $155 and $27 at  december  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  primarily
related to taxes pursuant to a tax-sharing  agreement between lmg and broadband.
that agreement existed prior to the tci merger.

18.  segment reporting

         at&amp;t;'s  results  are  segmented  according  to  the way we  manage  our
business: business services, consumer services, wireless services and broadband.

         our business services segment offers a variety of global communications
services,  including long distance,  local, and data and internet  protocol (ip)
networking,   to  small  and   medium-sized   businesses,   large  domestic  and
multinational  businesses and government  agencies.  business services is also a
provider  of  voice,  data and ip  transport  to  service  resellers  (wholesale
services). also included in the business services segment is at&amp;t; solutions, our
outsourcing and network-management business.

         our  consumer  services  segment  provides  a variety  of  any-distance
communications  services,  including long distance, local toll (intrastate calls
outside the immediate local area) and internet access to residential  customers.
in   addition,   consumer   services   provides   prepaid   calling   card   and
operator-handled  calling  services.  local  phone  service is also  provided in
certain areas.
<page>

         our wireless  services  segment offers wireless voice and data services
and products to customers in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and 1900  megahertz
(personal  communications  services,  or pcs)  markets.  wireless  services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the  united  states  and  internationally,  aviation-communications
services  and  fixed  wireless  services.  fixed  wireless  provides  high-speed
internet  access and  any-distance  voice services using wireless  technology to
residential and small business customers.

         our broadband  segment  offers a variety of services  through our cable
broadband network,  including  traditional analog video and new services such as
digital video, high-speed data and broadband telephony.

         the  balance of at&amp;t;'s  operations  (excluding  lmg) is  included  in a
"corporate and other" category. this category reflects corporate staff functions
and the elimination of transactions between segments,  as well as the results of
excite@home and international  operations and ventures.  lmg is not an operating
segment of at&amp;t; because at&amp;t; does not have a controlling  financial  interest in
lmg for financial accounting purposes. therefore, we account for this investment
under the equity  method.  additionally,  lmg's  results are not reviewed by the
chief  operating  decision-makers  for purposes of  determining  resources to be
allocated.

         total assets for our reportable  segments generally include all assets,
except intercompany receivables. however, our wireless services segment included
intercompany  receivables  from at&amp;t; and the related interest income since these
assets  relate to the  results  of the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracked  business.
prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
held at the  corporate  level and  therefore,  are included in the corporate and
other  category.  shared  network  assets  are  allocated  to the  segments  and
reallocated  each january based on two years of volumes.  capital  additions for
each segment include  capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment,
acquisitions of licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in
franchise costs and additions to internal-use software.

         the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant  accounting  policies (see note 1). at&amp;t; evaluates
performance based on several factors,  of which the primary financial measure is
earnings before interest and taxes,  including pretax minority  interest and net
pretax losses from other equity investments (ebit).

         generally,   at&amp;t;  accounts  for  business  services'  and  broadband's
intersegment transactions at market prices.

20.  consolidating condensed financial information

         in  conjunction  with the issuance of at&amp;t;  wireless  group and liberty
media group tracking stocks, at&amp;t; has separated for financial reporting purposes
in all  periods  the at&amp;t;  common  stock  group,  liberty  media  group and at&amp;t;
wireless group. below is the consolidating  financial information reflecting the
businesses of these  individual  groups,  including  the  allocation of expenses
between the groups in accordance with our allocation policies,  as well as other
related party transactions such as sales of services between groups and interest
income and  expense on  intercompany  borrowings.  the at&amp;t;  common  stock group
presented  below  excludes  its retained  portion of the value of at&amp;t;  wireless
group. at&amp;t; does not have a controlling  financial interest in lmg for financial
accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  lmg  is  reflected  as an
investment accounted for under the equity method and is reflected as such in the
consolidating financial statements below.

         at&amp;t; wireless group,  purchases long distance and other network-related
services  from at&amp;t; at  market-based  prices and  accordingly  such  amounts are
eliminated.  prior to the offering of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking  stock,  the
capital  structure of at&amp;t;  wireless  group had been  assumed  based upon at&amp;t;'s
historical capital ratio adjusted for certain items. intercompany interest rates
are  intended to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rate that at&amp;t;
wireless  group  would be able to obtain  or  receive  if it were a  stand-alone
entity.  general corporate overhead related to at&amp;t;'s corporate headquarters and
common support  divisions has been allocated to at&amp;t; wireless group based on the
ratio  of  at&amp;t;  wireless   group's   external  costs  and  expenses  to  at&amp;t;'s
consolidated  external costs and expenses,  adjusted for any functions that at&amp;t;
wireless  group  performs on its own.  the  consolidated  income tax  provision,
related tax  payments or refunds,  and  deferred  tax balances of at&amp;t; have been
alloated to at&amp;t; wireless group based  principally on the taxable income and tax
credits directly attributable to at&amp;t; wireless group.

         pursuant to the inter-group  agreement,  at&amp;t; does not allocate general
overhead expenses to libery media group and only charges liberty media group for
specific  services  that  liberty  media group  receives  from at&amp;t;  pursuant to
service agreements or similar arrangements. additionally, as liberty media group
operates independent of at&amp;t;, there is no cash or debt allocated to them.

22.  new accounting pronouncements

         in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb) issued
sfas no. 133,  "accounting for derivative  instruments and hedging  activities."
among other provisions,  it requires that entities  recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial  position and measure
those instruments at fair value.  gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. the effective date
for this  standard was delayed via the  issuance of sfas no. 137. the  effective
date for sfas no. 133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after june 15,  2000,
though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.
for at&amp;t;,  this means that the standard must be adopted no later than january 1,
2001.

         in june 2000,  the fasb issued sfas no.  138,  "accounting  for certain
derivative  instruments and certain hedging activities," as an amendment to sfas
no.  133.  this  statement   provides   clarification  with  regard  to  certain
implementation issues under sfas no. 133 on specific types of hedges.

         on january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; adopted sfas no. 133. we recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$1,370  of  income,  or  approximately   $0.34  per  diluted  share,   primarily
attributable  to fair value  adjustments of debt  instruments,  including  those
acquired in  conjunction  with the  mediaone  merger,  as well as to our warrant
portfolio.  in  addition,  in  connection  with the adoption of sfas no. 133, we
reclassified certain investment  securities,  which support debt that is indexed
to   those   securities,    from   "available-for-sale"   to   "trading."   this
reclassification  resulted  in  the  recognition  of  a  charge  of  $1,724,  or
approximately  $0.43 per  diluted  share,  net of  applicable  taxes,  which was
recorded as a  reduction  of other  income.  as  available-for-sale  securities,
changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive income
as a component of shareowners'  equity.  in addition,  lmg recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$800 of income, or approximately $0.31 per share.

         the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 133, as amended by sfas no. 138,
on at&amp;t;'s future  results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of our
derivatives  and related  financial  instruments  and could result in pronounced
quarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods.

         in  september  2000,  the fasb  issued sfas no.  140,  "accounting  for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and  extinguishments  of liabilities
- -- a replacement of fasb statement no. 125." this statement provides  accounting
and reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of  liabilities.  under  these  standards,  after a transfer of

23.  subsequent events

         on january 12, 2001,  at&amp;t; announced that cox and comcast had exercised
their  rights to sell a combined  total of 60.4  million  shares of  excite@home
series a common stock to at&amp;t; as part of an  agreement  announced in august 2000
to  reorganize  excite@home's  governance.  cox and  comcast  elected to receive
shares of at&amp;t; common stock in exchange for their  excite@home  shares.  at&amp;t; is
currently in discussions  to renegotiate  the terms of the put options which may
result in a change to the number of shares of at&amp;t;  stock  that cox and  comcast
will receive, as well as the number of excite@home shares, if any at&amp;t; receives.
there  can be no  assurance  that an  agreement  will be  reached  with  cox and
comcast.

         on  january  22,  2001,  at&amp;t;  and ntt  docomo  (docomo)  finalized  an
agreement whereby docomo invested  approximately $9.8 billion for a new class of
at&amp;t;  preferred  stock,   termed  docomo  wireless   tracking  stock,   that  is
economically  equivalent to 406 million  shares of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking
stock and reflects  approximately 16% of the financial  performance and economic
value of at&amp;t; wireless  group.  at&amp;t;  allocated  $6.2 billion of the proceeds to
at&amp;t; wireless group. each share of docomo wireless tracking stock is convertible
at any time into at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.  upon the conversion of the
docomo wireless  tracking  stock,  at&amp;t; will reduce its portion of the financial
performance and economic value in at&amp;t; wireless group by 178 million shares, and
the balance of the 406 million shares will come from the issuance of 228 million
new shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock. additionally,  upon completion
of the planned  split-off of at&amp;t; wireless,  the docomo wireless  tracking stock
and related  warrants will  automatically  be converted into at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking stock in the split-off.  in the event that at&amp;t;
has not split-off at&amp;t; wireless by specified  dates  beginning  january 1, 2002,
docomo will have the right, at its election,  to require at&amp;t; to repurchase from
docomo  the  preferred  shares  initially  issued to them at  docomo's  original
purchase price plus interest up to the date of payment.  the interest under this
right will be treated as preferred stock  dividends,  with charges recorded as a
reduction of at&amp;t; common stock group  earnings.  in  addition,  docomo  acquired
five-year  warrants to purchase the  equivalent  of an  additional  41.7 million
shares of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock at $35 per share.  as part of the
agreement,  docomo  obtained  a seat on at&amp;t;'s  board of  directors  until  at&amp;t;
wireless group is split-off  from at&amp;t; as a separate  public  company,  which is
expected to occur later in 2001. at that time, docomo will retain representation
on the new public at&amp;t; wireless board.  receipt of the docomo  proceeds  reduced
at&amp;t;'s existing $25 billion credit facility by $1.8 billion.

         in january  2001,  at&amp;t; entered into  agreements  with certain  network
equipment  vendors,  which  extend  through  2004,  to purchase  next-generation
wireless network equipment for a total of approximately $1.8 billion.

         on february 27, 2001,  at&amp;t;  entered  into an agreement  with  vodafone
group plc to sell our 10% stake in japan telecom co. ltd for approximately $1.35
billion in cash.  the  transaction is expected to be completed in april 2001 and
will result in a gain.

         on march 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless  completed a private  placement of $6.5
billion in notes.  the notes pay  interest at rates  ranging from 7.35% to 8.75%
per annum,  with  maturity  dates  ranging from 2006 to 2031.  the notes include
customary  covenants  and  registration  rights.  as a result of the issuance of
these notes,  at&amp;t;'s  existing $25 billion  credit  facility was reduced by $4.8
billion.

         on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless entered into $2.5 billion in revolving
credit facilities. the facilities consist of a 364-day facility of $1.25 billion
and a five-year  revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion.  the facilities may
be used for general  corporate  purposes and are subject to customary  covenants
and events of default.

                     management's discussion and analysis of
                  results of operations and financial condition

      overview

          at&amp;t;  wireless  group is an  integrated  business of at&amp;t; and is not a
      separate  legal entity.  on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; completed an offering of
      15.6%, or 360 million shares,  of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at an
      offering price of $29.50 per share.  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock is
      a class of at&amp;t; common  stock,  which is intended to provide  holders with
      financial returns based on the financial performance and economic value of
      at&amp;t;'s wireless services'  businesses.  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock
      issued in the offering  reflected only a portion of the authorized shares.
      the remaining 84.4% has been reserved for the benefit of at&amp;t; common stock
      group  (which  consists  of  the  operations  of  at&amp;t;  other  than  those
      attributed  to at&amp;t;  tracking  stocks) and is intended to be  reflected in
      at&amp;t; common stock.

          at&amp;t;  wireless  group  includes  the results of its mobility and fixed
      wireless  businesses,  as  well  as its  international  operations,  which
      primarily  include the earnings or losses associated with equity interests
      in international wireless communications ventures and partnerships.

          the combined  financial  statements of at&amp;t; wireless  group  primarily
      include the legal entity  results of at&amp;t; wireless  services,  inc and its
      subsidiaries (aws), at&amp;t; wireless group, llc (awg), at&amp;t; wireless pcs, llc
      and it  subsidiaries  (awpcs),  and  winston,  inc.  and its  subsidiaries
      (winston),  all of which are  direct  subsidiaries  of at&amp;t;  corp.,  as of
      december 31, 2000.  in february  2001,  the legal  entities of winston and
      awpcs as well as  certain  assets  of awg  were  transferred  to aws.  the
      remaining  assets and liabilities of awg will be transferred  prior to the
      split-off.

          on  october  25,  2000,  at&amp;t;  announced  its  decision  to present an
      exchange  offer to at&amp;t; common  shareowners  to allow them to exchange any
      portion of shares of at&amp;t; common stock for shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      tracking stock. on december 22, 2000, at&amp;t; filed a registration  statement
      for the exchange offer with the securities and exchange commission,  which
      was amended on february 23, 2001. at&amp;t; anticipates that the exchange offer
      will be completed  during the second quarter of 2001.  at&amp;t; wireless group
      will  continue  to be a part  of  at&amp;t;  following  the  completion  of the
      exchange offer.

          also on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; announced  its restructuring  plan.  in
      connection with their restructuring plan,  following the completion of the
      exchange  offer  and  subject  to  certain  conditions,  at&amp;t;  intends  to
      split-off  at&amp;t; wireless  group from at&amp;t.;  these  conditions  include the
      receipt of a favorable  ruling on the split-off from the internal  revenue
      service (irs) and  satisfaction of conditions  contained in at&amp;t;'s new $25
      billion credit agreement, including the repayment of at&amp;t; wireless group's
      intercompany  obligations to at&amp;t.; the split-off,  which is anticipated to
      be completed in mid-2001, would include several steps. these steps include
      transferring  substantially  all of the  assets  and  liabilities  of at&amp;t;
      wireless group to at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., mandatorily exchanging all
      issued and  outstanding  shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracking  stock,
      including those issued in the exchange offer,  for shares of at&amp;t; wireless
      services common stock,  and  distributing a majority of the shares of at&amp;t;
      wireless services common stock held by at&amp;t; common stock group, to holders
      of at&amp;t; common  stock on a pro rata  basis.  on february  14,  2001,  at&amp;t;
      announced  its  intention  to  retain up to $3  billion  of shares of at&amp;t;
      wireless  services  for its own account  for sale or  exchange  within six
      months of the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory irs ruling.
<page>
          in  january  2001,   ntt   docomo,   a   leading   japanese   wireless
      communications company,  invested $9.8 billion in a security of at&amp;t; that,
      like at&amp;t; wireless group tracking  stock, is intended to reflect a portion
      of the financial  performance  and economic value of at&amp;t; wireless  group.
      at&amp;t; wireless group,  through at&amp;t; wireless group, llc, was allocated $6.2
      billion of the proceeds  from  docomo's  $9.8 billion  investment in at&amp;t.;
      at&amp;t; retained the remaining $3.6 billion of the docomo investment proceeds
      as  consideration  for the  reduction in at&amp;t;'s  retained  portion of at&amp;t;
      wireless group's value.  following the split-off,  this investment will be
      converted into approximately 16% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common shares.
      docomo  also  received  warrants  at an  exercise  price  of $35 per  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  tracking  share   equivalent   that  would  represent  an
      approximate additional 1.6% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common shares after
      the split-off.  as part of this investment,  at&amp;t; wireless group,  through
      at&amp;t; wireless  services,  inc., has entered into a strategic alliance with
      docomo  to  develop  mobile  multimedia  services  on  a  global-standard,
      high-speed  wireless  network.  docomo may require the  repurchase  of its
      investment at docomo's  original  purchase price,  plus interest,  if at&amp;t;
      does not complete the split-off by specified  dates  beginning  january 1,
      2002 or if at&amp;t;  wireless  group  fails  to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.

                         combined results of operations
                      for the year ended december 31, 2000
                 compared with the year ended december 31, 1999

      revenue

          total revenue includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of
      handsets  and  accessories,  and  revenue  associated  with  the  aviation
      communications and fixed wireless operations.  at&amp;t; wireless group records
      revenue as services  are  provided  or when the product is sold.  services
      revenue  primarily  includes monthly recurring  charges,  airtime and toll
      usage charges, and roaming charges billed to subscribers for usage outside
      of at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  network  as well as  charges  billed  to other
      wireless  providers  for roaming on at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  network.  the
      revenue  and  related  expenses  associated  with the  sales  of  wireless
      handsets and  accessories  are recognized  when the products are delivered
      and  accepted  by the  customer,  as this is  considered  to be a separate
      earnings process from the sale of wireless services.

          total revenue  increased  37.0% to $10,448  million for the year ended
      december 31, 2000,  compared with the prior year. total revenue  increased
      29.6% for the year ended december 31, 2000,  compared with 1999,  adjusted
      to exclude the bay area  properties  for the six months ended december 31,
      2000,  and to exclude  vanguard  cellular  for the period  january 2000 to
      april  2000,  to  correlate  results  with  1999,  due  to  the  may  1999
      acquisition.  the revenue  increase for the year ended  december 31, 2000,
      was primarily due to growth in our mobility  business  revenue,  including
      both growth in services and equipment revenue.

          services  revenue for the year ended  december  31,  2000,  was $9,376
      million, an increase of $2,553 million, or 37.4%,  compared with 1999. the
      services  revenue  growth  was  driven by strong  consolidated  subscriber
      growth.  additionally,  an  increase in average  monthly  revenue per user
      (arpu) for the year ended december 31, 2000, compared with the prior year,
      contributed  to  the  revenue  growth.  at&amp;t;  digital  one  rate  service,
      including  additional  calling plans  introduced in august 2000 as well as
      the at&amp;t; regional and digital  advantage plans announced during the second
      quarter of 2000,  continue to contribute to growth in  subscribers as well
      as an increase in arpu.

          as of december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; wireless  group had nearly 15.2 million
      consolidated  subscribers,  an increase of 58.5%,  compared with the prior
      year,  of  which  90.1%  were  digital  subscribers,  up from  79.2% as of
      december 31, 1999. consolidated subscribers at december 31, 2000, included
      approximately  3.0 million  subscribers  associated with acquisitions that
      closed during 2000. net consolidated  wireless subscriber additions in the
      year ended december 31, 2000, totaled nearly 2.6 million, a 67.5% increase
      over the prior year,  including  865 thousand  during the fourth  quarter.
      at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  average  monthly  churn  rate for the year  ended
      december 31, 2000, was 2.9% compared with 2.6% for the year ended december
      31, 1999. at&amp;t; wireless  group's  average  monthly churn increased  during
      2000 as a  result  of  competitive  pressures,  as  well as at&amp;t;  wireless
      group's  efforts to expand the  customers  they serve to a broader base of
      consumer segments.  total subscribers,  including  partnership  markets in
      which at&amp;t; wireless group does not own a controlling  interest,  were over
      15.7 million at the end of 2000, a 28.9% increase over the prior year. due
      to the redemption of at&amp;t; wireless  group's interest in ab cellular during
      the fourth quarter of 2000, the houston market  subscribers of ab cellular
      are no longer included in at&amp;t; wireless group's total subscribers.  ending
      total  subscribers   included   approximately  450  thousand   subscribers
      associated with at&amp;t; wireless group's  acquisition of american cellular in
      february 2000.
<page>
          at&amp;t; wireless  group's arpu for the year ended  december 31, 2000, was
      $68.2, an increase of $2.4, or 3.6%,  compared with 1999. the increase was
      primarily due to increased  minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part
      by the  continued  success of at&amp;t; digital one rate service and other rate
      plans  introduced  in 2000.  at&amp;t; wireless  group's arpu trended  downward
      during the second half of 2000 as a result of market segmentation efforts.
      despite this, at&amp;t; wireless group's arpu remained higher than the wireless
      industry  average during the year ended december 31, 2000,  excluding at&amp;t;
      wireless  group.  as a result of our  market  segmentation  efforts,  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  anticipates  that arpu will  decline in 2001  relative to
      2000.

          equipment  revenue for the year ended  december 31,  2000,  was $1,072
      million, an increase of $268 million,  or 33.2%,  compared with 1999. this
      increase  was  primarily  due to a 53.6%  increase  in gross  consolidated
      subscriber  additions  during the year ended  december 31, 2000,  compared
      with 1999.  as an integral  part of the wireless  service  offering,  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  supplies to its  subscribers  a selection  of handsets at
      competitive prices, which are generally offered at or below cost.

      costs of services

          costs of  services  include  the costs to place calls over the network
      (including the costs to operate and maintain at&amp;t; wireless group's network
      as well as roaming costs paid to other wireless providers) and the charges
      paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of at&amp;t.;

          costs of services for the year ended  december  31, 2000,  were $3,169
      million, an increase of $589 million,  or 22.9%,  compared with 1999. this
      increase was due primarily to growth in the mobility  subscriber  base and
      their increased minutes of use which resulted in an increase in the access
      and other  connection  charges  paid to connect  calls on other  networks,
      including  at&amp;t;, as well as the costs to maintain  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's
      network. the costs of services associated with at&amp;t; wireless group's fixed
      wireless  business  increased  during  2000 as a result of the  commercial
      launch of  service  in several  markets.  additionally,  during the fourth
      quarter, at&amp;t; wireless group's costs of services included asset write-offs
      associated with changes in at&amp;t; wireless group's strategy for markets that
      overlap with at&amp;t;'s broadband markets

      costs of equipment sales

          costs  of  equipment  sales  include  the  costs of the  handsets  and
      accessories provided to at&amp;t; wireless group customers.  costs of equipment
      sales for the year ended december 31, 2000 were $2,041  million.  this was
      an increase of $775 million,  or 61.2%,  compared with 1999. this increase
      was due  primarily to higher gross  subscriber  additions in 2000 compared
      with the prior year.

      selling, general and administrative

          selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  for the  year  ended
      december 31, 2000, were $3,590  million,  compared with $2,663 million for
      the year ended december 31, 1999,  representing an increase of 34.8%. this
      increase was largely  attributable to higher  marketing and selling costs,
      primarily  advertising  and  commissions,  associated with the increase in
      gross  consolidated  subscriber  additions for the year ended december 31,
      2000, compared to 1999. cost per gross subscriber  addition (cpga),  which
      includes  the costs of handset  subsidies  recorded in costs of  equipment
      sales,  was $367 for both the year ended  december 31, 2000,  and 1999. in
<page>
      addition,  growth in the wireless customer base resulted in an increase in
      information technology and customer care related expenses.

      depreciation and amortization

          depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31,
      2000, were $1,686 million, an increase of $433 million, or 34.5%, compared
      with 1999. this increase  primarily  resulted from growth in at&amp;t; wireless
      group's  depreciable  asset base  resulting from capital  expenditures  to
      increase  the  capacity of the network and  improve  call  quality.  total
      capital  expenditures were $4,287 million and $2,476 million for the years
      ended december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. additionally, amortization
      expense,  which includes  amortization of licensing costs,  goodwill,  and
      other  intangibles,  increased for the year ended  december 31, 2000, as a
      result  of  the  1999  acquisitions  of  vanguard  cellular  and  honolulu
      cellular,  as well  as the  2000  acquisitions,  primarily  the  bay  area
      properties and wireless one which closed during june 2000.

      asset impairment and restructuring charges

          during the fourth quarter of 1999, at&amp;t; wireless group recorded a $531
      million asset  impairment  charge  primarily  associated  with the planned
      disposal of wireless communications  equipment resulting from a program to
      increase capacity and operating efficiency of the wireless network.

      other income

          other income primarily  includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges
      of assets,  intercompany interest income on the note receivable from at&amp;t;,
      and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.  other income for the
      year ended december 31, 2000, was $534 million, compared with $122 million
      for the year ended  december  31,  1999.  the  increase for the year ended
      december 31, 2000, was due primarily to the pretax gain of $379 million on
      the  transactions   associated  with  at&amp;t;  wireless   group's   affiliate
      investment in telecorp pcs,  interest  income on the note  receivable from
      at&amp;t;,  partially  offset by a pretax loss of $184 million  associated with
      the  acquisition of the los angeles  cellular  property  resulting from ab
      cellular's  redemption  of at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  equity  interest in ab
      cellular, as well as pretax gains recorded in 1999.

      interest expense

          interest expense consists  primarily of interest on intercompany  debt
      due to at&amp;t; less interest  expense  capitalized.  interest expense for the
      year ended december 31, 2000, was $85 million,  a decrease of $51 million,
      or 37.4%,  compared  with 1999.  the decrease was due to higher  levels of
      capitalized  interest as a result of increased  capital  expenditures,  as
      well as lower levels of average outstanding debt due to at&amp;t.; the decrease
      in the  average  outstanding  debt  due to at&amp;t;  was  attributable  to the
      recapitalization  of $2.0  billion  of long  term debt due to at&amp;t; into 9%
      cumulative preferred stock held by at&amp;t; subsequent to the offering of at&amp;t;
      wireless group tracking stock.  these decreases were partially offset by a
      higher rate of interest  charged on the  intercompany  debt in 2000 versus
      the prior year.

      provision (benefit) for income taxes

          the provision  for income taxes for the year ended  december 31, 2000,
      was $141  million,  compared  with a benefit of $294  million for the year
      ended december 31, 1999. the effective  income tax rate for the year ended
      december  31,  2000 was 34.1%,  compared  with  43.2%,  for the year ended
      december 31, 1999.  the effective  rate for 2000 was impacted by increased
<page>
      goodwill and other purchased  intangibles  amortization expense associated
      with  the  1999 and  2000  acquisitions  as well as the sale of a  foreign
      equity  investment during 2000. the effective income tax rate for 1999 was
      impacted by the benefit from a change in the valuation allowance and other
      estimates,   offset  by  amortization  of  goodwill  and  other  purchased
      intangibles.

      net equity earnings (losses) from investments

          net equity earnings  (losses) from  investments,  net of tax, was $388
      million of earnings for the year ended  december 31, 2000,  compared  with
      $19 million of losses for 1999.  the increase was  primarily due to a $372
      million  after-tax  gain  included in equity  earnings  for at&amp;t;  wireless
      group's portion of the gain recognized by ab cellular on the redemption of
      at&amp;t; wireless group's equity interest in ab cellular.

      dividend requirements on preferred stock held by at&amp;t;

          at december 31, 2000 and 1999,  at&amp;t; wireless  group had  outstanding,
      $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock held by
      at&amp;t; that pays  dividends at 9% per annum.  long-term  debt due to at&amp;t; of
      $2.0  billion was  recapitalized  into an  additional  $2.0  billion of 9%
      cumulative  preferred stock held by at&amp;t; following the offering.  dividend
      requirements on this preferred stock for the year ended december 31, 2000,
      were $130  million  and for the year ended  december  31,  1999,  were $56
      million,  net of  amounts  recorded  in  accordance  with the tax  sharing
      agreement.

                      for the year ended december 31, 1999
                 compared with the year ended december 31, 1998

      revenue

          total  revenue  for the year  ended  december  31,  1999,  was  $7,627
      million, an increase of $2,221 million, or 41.1%, compared with 1998. at&amp;t;
      wireless  group's  1999  results  included  vanguard  cellular  since  its
      acquisition  on may  3,1999,  and  1998  results  included  its  messaging
      business  until its sale on  october  2, 1998.  adjusted  to exclude  both
      vanguard  cellular  and its  messaging  business,  total  revenue for at&amp;t;
      wireless group increased by 39.0% compared with 1998.

          the revenue increase was driven  primarily by consolidated  subscriber
      growth and rising  arpu.  as of december  31,  1999,  ending  consolidated
      subscribers  increased  33.4%  compared  with 1998.  at&amp;t; digital one rate
      service significantly  contributed to the increase in arpu and subscribers
      by acquiring and retaining high value customers,  who have a significantly
      higher arpu than an average subscriber.

          services  revenue for the year ended  december  31,  1999,  was $6,823
      million, an increase of $2,044 million, or 42.8%, compared with 1998.

          as  of  december  31,  1999,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  had  9.6  million
      consolidated  subscribers,  an increase of 33.4%  compared  with the prior
      year,  of  which  79.2%  were  digital  subscribers,  up from  60.7% as of
      december  31,  1998.  included in these  figures  were  approximately  700
      thousand  subscribers  from our  acquisition  of vanguard  cellular in may
      1999,  approximately  125 thousand  subscribers  from our  acquisition  of
      honolulu cellular in august 1999 and approximately 45 thousand subscribers
      from our acquisition of bakersfield cellular in april 1999. including at&amp;t;
      wireless group's  partnership  markets,  approximately  9.4 million of the
      12.2 million total  subscribers  were digital  subscribers  as of december
      31,1999.
<page>
          at&amp;t;  wireless  group's arpu for the year ended  december 31, 1999 was
      $65.8, an increase of $8.2, or 14.2%, compared with 1998. the increase was
      primarily due to increased  minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part
      by the success of at&amp;t; digital one rate  service.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's
      arpu  remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average
      during 1999, excluding at&amp;t; wireless group.

          equipment  revenue  for the  year  ended  december  31,  1999 was $804
      million,  an increase of $177 million,  or 28.2%,  compared with 1998. the
      increase  was  primarily  due to a 25.1%  increase  in gross  consolidated
      subscriber  additions in 1999  compared  with 1998. as an integral part of
      the wireless  service  offering,  at&amp;t; wireless  group supplies to its new
      subscribers  a  selection  of handsets at  competitive  prices,  which are
      generally offered at or below cost.

      costs of services

          costs of  services  for the year ended  december  31, 1999 were $2,580
      million.  this was an increase of $1,152 million, or 80.7%,  compared with
      1998. the increase was due primarily to roaming  expenses  associated with
      the  success  of at&amp;t;  digital  one rate  service as  off-network  roaming
      minutes of use  increased by 194.7% for the year ended  december 31, 1999,
      compared with 1998.

          although  roaming  expenses  continued to impact  results for the year
      ended  december  31, 1999,  the rate of roaming  expense  growth  declined
      significantly  during  the latter  half of 1999,  as at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      introduced  initiatives  to  aggressively  migrate  more minutes onto at&amp;t;
      wireless  group's network as well as reduced  intercarrier  roaming rates.
      at&amp;t; wireless group continued to seek to decrease roaming expenses through
      capital  spending  for  network  expansion,   acquisitions  and  affiliate
      launches.  roaming  rates  also  declined  significantly  as a  result  of
      renegotiated  roaming  agreements and the  deployment of irdb  technology,
      which  assists in  identifying  favorable  roaming  partners  in areas not
      included in at&amp;t; wireless group's  network.  all of these efforts resulted
      in a reduction of approximately 18% in the average roaming rate per minute
      paid to other carriers for the year ended december 31, 1999, compared with
      1998.

      costs of equipment sales

          costs of  equipment  sales for the year ended  december  31, 1999 were
      $1,266 million.  this was an increase of $266 million, or 26.6%,  compared
      with 1998.  this  increase was  primarily  the result of  increased  gross
      subscriber   additions  in  1999  compared  with  1998.  gross  subscriber
      additions  increased 25.1% for the year ended 1999 compared with the prior
      year.

      selling, general and administrative

          sg&amp;a; expenses for the year ended december 31, 1999 were $2,663 million
      compared with $2,122  million for the year ended  december  31,1998.  this
      increase was due to higher marketing and selling costs associated with the
      increase in consolidated gross subscriber  additions in 1999 compared with
      1998, as well as the growth in customer care expenses  associated with the
      larger consolidated subscriber base.
<page>
      depreciation and amortization

          depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31,
      1999 were $1,253  million,  an increase of $174  million,  or 16.1%.  this
      increase  primarily  resulted  from a larger  asset  base  and  additional
      amortization of goodwill and other purchased  intangibles  associated with
      the acquisition of vanguard  cellular.  capital  expenditures for the year
      ended december 31, 1999 and 1998,  were $2,476 million and $1,136 million,
      respectively.

      asset impairment and restructuring charges

          during the fourth quarter of 1999, at&amp;t; wireless group recorded a $531
      million asset  impairment  charge  primarily  associated  with the planned
      disposal of wireless communications  equipment resulting from a program to
      increase capacity and operating efficiency of the wireless network.  asset
      impairment and restructuring  charges for the year ended december 31, 1998
      were $120 million,  which  represented  the  write-down  of  unrecoverable
      assets associated with non-strategic businesses.

      other income

          other income for the year ended  december  31, 1999 was $122  million.
      other income for the year ended  december 31, 1998 was $650  million.  the
      decrease  was due  primarily  to the pretax  gains on sales in 1998 of lin
      television  corporation  of  $342  million,  smartone   telecommunications
      holdings limited of $128 million and pricecellular of $67 million.

      interest expense

          interest expense consists  primarily of interest on intercompany  debt
      due to at&amp;t.;  interest  was  charged at 7.25% per annum for the year ended
      december  31,  1999 and 7.75% per annum for the year  ended  december  31,
      1998.  interest  expense  for the year ended  december  31,  1999 was $136
      million,  an increase of $16 million,  or 13.3%,  compared with 1998.  the
      increase was due to a higher level of average debt outstanding,  partially
      offset by the impact of the lower rate charged by at&amp;t; in 1999.

      provision (benefit) for income taxes

          the benefit for income taxes for the year ended  december 31, 1999 was
      $294  million,  compared  with a tax provision of $59 million for the year
      ended  december  31,  1998.  the  benefit  for  income  taxes  in 1999 was
      primarily  due to the pre-tax loss for the period  coupled with changes in
      the valuation  allowance  and other  estimates.  the effective  income tax
      rates for the years  ended  december  31,  1999 and 1998,  were  43.2% and
      31.6%,  respectively.  the effective income tax rate for 1998 was impacted
      by the effect of state taxes, net of federal benefit, and the amortization
      of  intangibles,  partially  offset  by  the  effects  of  changes  in the
      valuation allowance and other estimates.

      net equity earnings (losses) from investments

          net equity earnings (losses) from investments,  net of tax, was a loss
      of $19  million  for the year  ended  december  31,  1999,  compared  with
      earnings of $36 million for 1998.  the decrease was  primarily a result of
      increased  losses  associated  with affiliate  investments.  additionally,
      equity  losses  increased  in  1999  compared  with  1998  due  to  losses
      associated with financial commitments related to certain investments.

      dividend requirements on preferred stock held by at&amp;t;

          at&amp;t; wireless group had $1.0 billion of preferred  stock held by at&amp;t;,
      as of december  31, 1999 and 1998,  that paid  dividends  at 9% per annum.
      dividend  requirements on this preferred stock for each of the years ended
      december  31, 1999 and 1998 were $56 million,  net of amounts  recorded in
      accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

                         liquidity and capital resources

          the  continued   expansion  of  at&amp;t;  wireless   group's  network  and
      footprint,  including  spectrum auctions,  and service offerings,  and the
      marketing and distribution of its products and services,  will continue to
      require substantial capital. at&amp;t; wireless group has funded its operations
      by offering proceeds  attributed from at&amp;t;,  intercompany  borrowings from
      at&amp;t; and internally generated funds, as well as capital contributions from
      at&amp;t; prior to the offering.  capital  contributions from at&amp;t; prior to the
      offering  included  acquisitions made by at&amp;t; that have been attributed to
      at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  noncash  capital  contributions  from at&amp;t; to at&amp;t;
      wireless group related to acquisitions and initial  investments  funded by
      at&amp;t; totaled $539 million,  $2,553 million, and $982 million for the years
      ended december 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

          the april 2000 offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock resulted
      in net proceeds to at&amp;t; after deducting underwriter's discount and related
      fees and expenses of $10.3 billion.  at&amp;t;  attributed  $7.0 billion of the
      net proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless  group in the form of an  intercompany  note
      receivable,  which was repaid by december 31, 2000, and was used primarily
      to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.

          on  may  1,  2000,   following  the  offering,   at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      recapitalized  $2.0 billion of outstanding  intercompany  indebtedness  to
      at&amp;t; into an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held
      by at&amp;t.; in conjunction with the  recapitalization,  at&amp;t; wireless group's
      long-term debt due to at&amp;t; was  recapitalized to be 10 year term debt that
      bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% per annum.

          currently, financing activities for at&amp;t; wireless group are managed by
      at&amp;t; on a centralized basis and are subject to the review of at&amp;t; wireless
      group's  capital  stock  committee.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  capital  stock
      committee  is  selected  by  at&amp;t;'s  board of  directors  to  oversee  the
      interaction  between  businesses  of at&amp;t;  common  stock  group  and  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  in  accordance   with  the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  policy
      statement.  under the at&amp;t; wireless group policy  statement,  all material
      transactions  between at&amp;t; common stock group and at&amp;t; wireless  group are
      determined  and  governed by a process of fair  dealing.  sources for at&amp;t;
      wireless group's future  financing  requirements may include the borrowing
      of funds,  including  additional  short-term  floating rate debt from at&amp;t;
      and/or  third-party  debt.  loans from at&amp;t; to any member of at&amp;t; wireless
      group have been made at interest  rates and on other terms and  conditions
      intended to be  substantially  equivalent to the interest  rates and other
      terms and conditions that at&amp;t; wireless group would be able to obtain from
      third parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of at&amp;t;
      without the benefit of any guaranty by at&amp;t.; this policy contemplates that
      these  loans will be made on the basis set forth above  regardless  of the
      interest  rates and  other  terms and  conditions  on which  at&amp;t; may have
      acquired the funds. if, however,  at&amp;t; incurs any fees or charges in order
      to keep  available  funds for use by at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  those fees or
      charges will be allocated to at&amp;t; wireless group.

          in association with the intended split-off of at&amp;t; wireless group from
      at&amp;t; announced on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; and at&amp;t; wireless services,  inc.
      anticipate  that  they  will  enter  into a  separation  and  distribution
      agreement  that will  govern the terms of the  split-off.  as part of this
      agreement,  at&amp;t;  wireless  services  will agree,  upon  completion of the
      split-off,  to repay the full  amount of the  principal  and  accrued  but
      unpaid  interest or face value and accrued  but unpaid  dividends,  of all
      outstanding  indebtedness  owned by at&amp;t; wireless  group to at&amp;t;,  and all
      preferred stock in at&amp;t; wireless group held by at&amp;t.;

          on january 22, 2001,  at&amp;t; closed their  transaction  with ntt docomo.
      at&amp;t; attributed  $6.2 billion of the approximate  $9.8 billion of proceeds
      received from docomo to at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany
      note  receivable.  at&amp;t; wireless  group intends to utilize the proceeds to
      continue executing their strategy to expand their capacity,  enlarge their
      footprint,  create  an  advanced  mobile  internet  and  invest  in  other
      strategic  growth  initiatives,   as  well  as  to  satisfy   intercompany
      obligations.

          on march 23, 2001,  at&amp;t;  wireless group,  through aws,  entered  into
      competitive  advance and revolving credit facilities (the "facilities") in
      the aggregate amount of $2.5 billion  consisting of an up to $1.25 billion
      364-day  competitive  advance and revolving  credit  facility and an up to
      $1.25 billion five-year competitive advance and revolving credit facility.
      the facilities are subject to a facility fee and  utilization fee and bear
      interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases,  libor, the prime
      rate or the rates on overnight federal funds transactions.  the facilities
      may be used for general  corporate  purposes  and are subject to customary
      covenants,  representations  and  warranties  and  events of  default.  in
      addition,  the  facilities  contain  financial  covenants  providing for a
      maximum  total debt to total  consolidated  operational  ebitda  ratio (as
      defined  in the  facilities  agreement)  not to exceed 4:0 to 1:0 for at&amp;t;
      wireless group and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5:1.0.  from the
      date of the closing of the  facilities  until the date of the split-off of
      at&amp;t; wireless group,  aws will be prohibited from declaring  and/or paying
      dividends.  the facility  also  specifies  limitations  on at&amp;t;'s and at&amp;t;
      wireless group's ability to consummate the split-off including a provision
      that  it  will  constitute  an  event  of  default  if  the  split-off  is
      consummated  without  obtaining a favorable  tax ruling from the irs or an
      unqualified  tax opinion  that the  split-off  will  qualify as a tax-free
      transaction.  in addition, the existence of an obligation by at&amp;t; wireless
      group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  docomo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.

          on march 1, 2001,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through  aws,  completed  a
      private placement of $6.5 billion in senior notes with maturity dates from
      2006 to 2031.  the notes pay  interest  at rates  ranging  from  7.350% to
      8.750% per annum,  and  include  customary  covenants.  the notes  include
      registration rights, such that aws is required to exchange the notes for a
      new issue of notes  registered under the securities act of 1933 and are to
      be declared effect no later than 240 days after the issue date.

          at&amp;t; performs  cash  management  functions on behalf of  at&amp;t; wireless
      group.  substantially all of at&amp;t; wireless group's cash balances are swept
      to at&amp;t; on a daily  basis,  where they are managed  and  invested by at&amp;t.;
      prior to the offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock,  transfers of
      cash to and from at&amp;t; were reflected as a component of combined attributed
      net assets,  with no interest income or expense  reflected.  subsequent to
      the offering,  transfers  are reflected as changes in the note  receivable
      from at&amp;t.;  cash balances  maintained  and reported by at&amp;t; wireless group
      primarily represent cash balances for which no right of offset exists with
      at&amp;t.;
<page>
          net cash provided by operating  activities for the year ended december
      31,  2000,  was $1,635  million,  compared  with $867 million for the year
      ended  december  31,  1999.  the  increase in cash  provided by  operating
      activities was primarily due to an increase in operating  income excluding
      depreciation and amortization,  and the asset impairment and restructuring
      charge in 1999, resulting from revenue growth and expense leveraging,  and
      an increase in operating and payroll related accruals, partially offset by
      increases in inventories and accounts receivable.

          net cash used in investing  activities for the year ended december 31,
      2000, was $10,525 million, compared with $2,123 million for the year ended
      december 31, 1999.  the  investing  activities  included on at&amp;t;  wireless
      group's  statements of cash flows include cash expenditures or receipts of
      cash for  investing  transactions  directly  attributable  to the wireless
      group  operations,  and those legal  entities  that comprise the financial
      statements of at&amp;t; wireless  group.  these amounts are  representative  of
      what at&amp;t; wireless group would report on a stand-alone basis. the increase
      was due  primarily  to the  acquisitions  of wireless  systems in houston,
      indianapolis  and san diego,  the bay area  properties,  and wireless one.
      equity investment  purchases increased primarily due to the acquisition of
      equity  interests  in  international  ventures,   acquired  from  at&amp;t;  in
      association  with their  acquisition  of mediaone.  in  addition,  capital
      expenditures increased as a result of efforts to increase network capacity
      in existing markets as well as to expand the national footprint.

          net cash  provided by financing  activities  for the year december 31,
      2000, was $8,947 million,  compared with $1,234 million for the year ended
      december 31, 1999.  the increase was primarily due to proceeds  attributed
      from the offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking  stock,  short-term debt
      borrowed from at&amp;t; as well as increased  transfers  from at&amp;t; prior to the
      offering, to fund acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.

          net cash provided by operating  activities for the year ended december
      31, 1999 was $867 million  compared  with $414 million of cash provided by
      operating  activities in 1998 primarily due to increased  operating income
      excluding  depreciation  and  amortization,  and the asset  impairment and
      restructuring  charges and larger  increases  in  operating  accruals  and
      accounts  payable.  these  increases  were offset by a higher  increase in
      accounts  receivable  driven by strong  revenue  growth.  net cash used in
      investing  activities  for the year  ended  december  31,1999  was  $2,123
      million,  compared  with  $238  million  of  cash  provided  by  investing
      activities in 1998.  the  difference  was due primarily to higher  capital
      expenditures to upgrade and increase  capacity in existing markets as well
      as to expand the national  footprint,  and lower cash proceeds  associated
      with the sales of  equity  investments.  net cash  provided  by  financing
      activities  for the  year  ended  december  31,  1999 was  $1,234  million
      compared  with $631 million of cash used in financing  activities  in 1998
      due to increased transfers and debt financing from at&amp;t; to fund the higher
      capital expenditures during 1999.

          ebitda, defined as earnings before interest and taxes, excluding other
      income, plus depreciation and amortization, is the primary measure used by
      the chief  operating  decision-makers  to measure  our ability to generate
      cash flow.  ebitda may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation  of
      ebitda for other public companies and should not be viewed by investors as
      an alternative to generally accepted  accounting  principles,  measures of
      performance  or to cash  flows from  operating,  investing  and  financing
      activities as a measure of liquidity.
<page>
          ebitda for the year  ended  december  31,  2000,  was $1,648  million,
      compared  with $587 million for the year ended  december  31, 1999.  on an
      operational  basis,  adjusted  to exclude  the 1999 asset  impairment  and
      restructuring  charge of $531 million,  ebitda  increased  $530 million or
      47.3%.  the increase was primarily the result of revenue  growth and lower
      off-network  roaming  expenses.  these increases were partially  offset by
      increased customer acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross
      subscriber  additions,  increased network costs attributable to the growth
      in  subscribers  and  their  minutes  of use,  and  increased  information
      technology  and  customer  care  related  costs to  support  growth in the
      subscriber base.

          for our  mobility  business,  ebitda for the year ended  december  31,
      2000,  was $1,884  million,  compared with $670 million for the year ended
      december 31, 1999.  excluding the 1999 asset impairment and  restructuring
      charge, mobility ebitda increased $686 million or 57.2%.

          for our fixed  wireless  business,  ebitda for the year ended december
      31, 2000,  was a deficit of $228  million,  compared with a deficit of $75
      million  the year  ended  december  31,  1999.  excluding  the 1999  asset
      impairment and restructuring  charge, fixed wireless ebitda decreased $156
      million or 213.4%.

          ebitda  margins  were  15.8% for the year  ended  december  31,  2000,
      compared with 14.7% for the year and december 31, 1999, excluding the 1999
      asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charge.  the  improvement in ebitda
      margins for the year ended  december 31, 2000,  compared to the year ended
      december  31, 1999,  was  primarily  driven by revenue  growth and expense
      leveraging,  primarily  off-network roaming expenses,  partially offset by
      increased  customer  acquisition  and customer care costs  associated with
      growth in the subscriber base.

          ebitda margins for our mobility business were 18.0% for the year ended
      december 31,  2000,  compared  with 15.7% for the year ended  december 31,
      1999, excluding the 1999 asset impairment and restructuring charge.

          ebitda for the year ended december 31, 1999 was $587 million  compared
      with $736 million for the year ended december 31, 1998.  excluding  pretax
      asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges of $531 million in 1999 and
      $120  million  in  1998,   ebitda  was  $1,118  million  for  1999,  which
      represented  an increase of $262  million,  or 30.6%,  compared with 1998.
      this  increase  was  attributable  to  increases  in total  revenue and an
      improving margin as sg&amp;a; expenses declined as a percentage of revenue.

          for our  mobility  business,  ebitda for the year ended  december  31,
      1999,  was $670  million,  compared  with $794  million for the year ended
      december 31, 1998.  excluding  pretax asset  impairment and  restructuring
      charges  of $528  million  in 1999 and $120  million  in 1998,  ebitda was
      $1,198 million for 1999 compared with $914 million for 1998.

          excluding   the   aforementioned    pretax   asset   impairment    and
      restructuring  charges in 1999 and 1998, ebitda margins were 14.7% for the
      year ended december 31, 1999,  compared with 15.8% in 1998. the decline in
      ebitda  margins  in 1999  compared  with  1998  was  driven  primarily  by
      increased  roaming  expenses,  as well as  increased  sales and  marketing
      expenses associated with a 25.1% increase in gross consolidated subscriber
      additions in 1999 compared with 1998.

          excluding the aforementioned pretax asset impairment and restructuring
      charges in 1999 and 1998,  ebitda  margins for our mobility  business were
      15.7% for the year ended  december 31, 1999,  compared  with 16.9% for the
      year ended december 31, 1998.
<page>
                               financial condition

          total assets were $35,302 million as of december 31, 2000, an increase
      of $11,790  million,  or 50.1%,  compared  with  december  31,  1999.  the
      increase was due primarily to increases in licensing costs,  goodwill, and
      property,  plant and equipment  associated with the acquisitions closed in
      2000,  including  the  acquisitions  of wireless  one,  l.p. and  wireless
      systems in the san francisco bay area,  san diego,  indianapolis,  houston
      and los  angeles.  in  addition,  the  increase  in  property,  plant  and
      equipment was a result of significant  capital  expenditures  for the year
      ended  december 31,  2000.  these  increases  were  partially  offset by a
      decrease in  investments  as at&amp;t; wireless  group  previously  held equity
      interests  in  portions  of the bay area  properties,  and the los angeles
      market,  through  their  interest  in  ab  cellular.  these  markets  were
      consolidated as of december 31, 2000.

          total  liabilities  were  $10,384  million as of december  31, 2000, a
      increase of $889 million,  or 9.4%,  compared with december 31, 1999.  the
      increase was  primarily  due to  increases  in deferred  income taxes as a
      result of gains recorded during the fourth  quarter,  as well as increased
      marketing, business tax and other operating accruals. these increases were
      partially offset by a net decrease in intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t.;

          combined  attributed net assets was $24,887 million as of december 31,
      2000, an increase of $10,880 million, or 77.7%, compared with december 31,
      1999.  the  increase  was  primarily  due to the  attribution  of offering
      proceeds to at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  net  transfers  from at&amp;t; prior to the
      offering  to  fund  capital  expansion  and  acquisitions,  as well as the
      additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock issued to at&amp;t.;

                        recent accounting pronouncements

          in september  2000, the financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb)
      issued sfas no. 140,  "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial
      assets and extinguishments of liabilities--a replacement of fasb no. 125".
      this statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
      and  servicing of financial  assets and  extinguishments  of  liabilities.
      under these  standards,  after a transfer of financial  assets,  an entity
      recognizes  the  financial  and  servicing  assets  it  controls  and  the
      liabilities it has incurred,  derecognizes  financial  assets when control
      has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. this
      statement provides  consistent  standards for distinguishing  transfers of
      financial   assets  that  are  sales  from   transfers  that  are  secured
      borrowings.  this  statement is effective  for  transfers and servicing of
      financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring after march
      31, 2001.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group does not expect that the adoption of sfas
      no.  140  will  have a  material  impact  on its  results  of  operations,
      financial position or cash flows.

          in june 1998, the fasb issued sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative
      instruments and hedging activities".  among other provisions,  it requires
      that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in
      the statement of financial  position and measure those instruments at fair
      value. gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those
      derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative
      and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  the effective date of this
      standard was delayed via the issuance of sfas no. 137. the effective  date
      for sfas no. 133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after june 15, 2000,
      though  earlier  adoption is encouraged  and  retroactive  application  is
      prohibited.  for at&amp;t; wireless group, this means that the standard must be
      adopted no later than january 1, 2001. in june 2000,  the fasb issued sfas
      no.  138,  "accounting  for  certain  derivative  instruments  and certain
      hedging  activities"  as an  amendment  to sfas no.  133.  this  statement
      provides clarification with regard to certain
<page>
      implementation  issues under sfas no. 133 on specific types of hedges. the
      adoption of sfas no. 133 in january 2001,  did not have a material  impact
      to the at&amp;t; wireless group's results of operations,  financial position or
      cash flows.  in  addition,  based on the types of  contracts  we currently
      have, at&amp;t; wireless group does not anticipate that this standard will have
      a material impact on future results of at&amp;t; wireless group.

                                subsequent events

          in january 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group executed  agreements with certain
      network   equipment   vendors,   related   to  the   development   of  its
      next-generation  network strategy.  these agreements require at&amp;t; wireless
      group to buy equipment  from these  vendors  totaling  approximately  $1.8
      billion through 2004.

          effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group implemented the results
      of  a  review  of  the  estimated   service  lives  of  certain   wireless
      communications equipment,  primarily electronics.  lives were shortened to
      fully depreciate all such equipment within seven years.  similar equipment
      acquired  after  january 1, 2001,  will have  useful  lives no longer than
      seven years.

          on january 22, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws,  completed its
      previously  announced  transaction  with  docomo.  see note 1 for  further
      discussion of the transaction.

          on november 17, 2000,  at&amp;t; wireless group announced that at&amp;t;'s board
      of directors  had approved an agreement  under which at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      would   purchase   $200  in  series  aa   preferred   stock  from   dobson
      communications  corporation.  at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws, completed
      this  transaction  on  february  8, 2001.  the series aa  preferred  stock
      acquired  has  a  liquidation  preference  of  $1,000  per  share  and  is
      exchangeable  into series a convertible  preferred stock. if the series aa
      preferred  stock is exchanged into series a convertible  preferred  stock,
      at&amp;t; wireless group will increase its ownership  interest in dobson, on an
      as converted to common stock basis,  from its current ownership of 4.6% to
      approximately 11.6%.

          on march 23, 2001,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through aws,  entered into
      competitive  advance and revolving credit facilities (the "facilities") in
      the aggregate amount of $2.5 billion consisting of and up to $1.25 billion
      364-day  competitive  advance and revolving  credit  facility and an up to
      $1.25 billion five-year competitive advance and revolving credit facility.
      the facilities are subject to a facility fee and  utilization fee and bear
      interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases,  libor, the prime
      rate or the rates on overnight federal funds transactions.  the facilities
      may be used for general  corporate  purposes  and are subject to customary
      covenants,  representations  and  warranties  and  events of  default.  in
      addition,  the  facilities  contain  financial  covenants  providing for a
      maximum  total debt to total  consolidated  operational  ebitda  ratio (as
      defined  in the  facilities  agreement)  not to exceed 4:0 to 1:0 for at&amp;t;
      wireless group and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5:1.0.  from the
      date of the closing of the  facilities  until the date of the split-off of
      at&amp;t; wireless group,  aws will be prohibited from declaring  and/or paying
      dividends.  the facility  also  specifies  limitations  on at&amp;t;'s and at&amp;t;
      wireless group's ability to consummate the split-off including a provision
      that  it  will  constitute  an  event  of  default  if  the  split-off  is
      consummated  without  obtaining a favorable  tax ruling from the irs or an
      unqualified  tax opinion  that the  split-off  will  qualify as a tax-free
      transaction.  in addition, the existence of an obligation by at&amp;t; wireless
      group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  docomo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.

          on february 26, 2001, at&amp;t; agreed to sell its entire interest in japan
      telecom for approximately  $1.35 billion.  the net after-tax  proceeds are
      expected to be approximately  $1 billion.  at&amp;t; has indicated that the net
      after-tax  proceeds  will be split evenly  between at&amp;t; and at&amp;t;  wireless
      group.   at&amp;t;  wireless  group   anticipates  that  it  will  recognize  a
      significant gain on the transaction.

          on march 1, 2001,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through  aws,  completed  a
      private placement of $6.5 billion in senior notes with maturity dates from
      2006 to 2031.  the notes pay  interest  at rates  ranging  from  7.350% to
      8.750% per annum,  and  include  customary  covenants.  the notes  include
      registration rights, such that aws is required to exchange the notes for a
      new issue of notes  registered under the securities act of 1933 and are to
      be declared effect no later than 240 days after the issue date.

                          report of independent accountants

      to the board of directors and shareowners of at&amp;t; corp.:

          in our  opinion,  the  accompanying  combined  balance  sheets and the
      related  combined   statements  of  operations  and  changes  in  combined
      attributed  net assets and of cash flows present  fairly,  in all material
      respects,  the financial  position of at&amp;t; wireless  group at december 31,
      2000 and 1999,  and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows
      for each of the three years in the period  ended  december  31,  2000,  in
      conformity with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the united
      states of america.  these financial  statements are the  responsibility of
      at&amp;t; wireless  group's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an
      opinion on these financial  statements  based on our audits.  we conducted
      our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards
      generally accepted in the united states of america,  which require that we
      plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether
      the  financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  an audit
      includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and
      disclosures  in  the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting
      principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,   and
      evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.  we believe that
      our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          at&amp;t; wireless group is a fully integrated business unit of at&amp;t; corp.;
      consequently,  as indicated in note 1, these combined financial statements
      have  been  derived  from  the  consolidated   financial   statements  and
      accounting  records of at&amp;t; corp.  and  reflect  certain  assumptions  and
      allocations.  moreover, as indicated in note 1, at&amp;t; wireless group relies
      on at&amp;t; corp.  for  administrative,  management  and other  services.  the
      financial position,  results of operations and cash flows of at&amp;t; wireless
      group could differ from those that would have  resulted had at&amp;t;  wireless
      group operated  autonomously or as an entity  independent of at&amp;t; corp. as
      more fully discussed in note 1, the combined financial  statements of at&amp;t;
      wireless group should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
      financial statements of at&amp;t; corp.

      background

          at&amp;t;  wireless  group is an  integrated  business of at&amp;t; and is not a
      separate  legal entity.  on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; completed an offering of
      15.6%, or 360 million shares,  of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at an
      offering price of $29.50 per share.  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock is
      a class of at&amp;t; common  stock,  which is intended to provide  holders with
      financial returns based on the financial performance and economic value of
      at&amp;t;'s wireless services'  businesses.  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock
      issued in the offering  reflected only a portion of the authorized shares.
      the remaining 84.4% has been reserved for the benefit of at&amp;t; common stock
      group  (which  consists  of  the  operations  of  at&amp;t;  other  than  those
      attributed  to at&amp;t;  tracking  stocks) and is intended to be  reflected in
      at&amp;t; common stock.

          on  october  25,  2000,  at&amp;t;  announced  its  decision  to present an
      exchange  offer to at&amp;t; common  shareowners  to allow them to exchange any
      portion of shares of at&amp;t; common stock for shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      tracking stock. on december 22, 2000, at&amp;t; filed a registration  statement
      for the exchange offer with the securities and exchange commission,  which
      was amended on february 23, 2001. at&amp;t; anticipates that the exchange offer
      will be completed  during the second quarter of 2001.  at&amp;t; wireless group
      will  continue  to be a part  of  at&amp;t;  following  the  completion  of the
      exchange offer.

          also on october 25, 2000,  at&amp;t; announced its  restructuring  plan. in
      connection with its  restructuring  plan,  following the completion of the
      exchange  offer  and  subject  to  certain  conditions,  at&amp;t;  intends  to
      split-off  at&amp;t; wireless  group from at&amp;t.;  these  conditions  include the
      receipt of a favorable  ruling on the split-off from the internal  revenue
      service (irs) and  satisfaction of conditions  contained in at&amp;t;'s new $25
      billion credit agreement, including the repayment of at&amp;t; wireless group's
      intercompany  obligations to at&amp;t.; the split-off,  which is anticipated to
      be completed in mid-2001, would include several steps. these steps include
      transferring  substantially  all of the  assets  and  liabilities  of at&amp;t;
      wireless group to at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., mandatorily exchanging all
      issued and  outstanding  shares of at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracking  stock,
      including those issued in the exchange offer,  for shares of at&amp;t; wireless
      services common stock,  and  distributing a majority of the shares of at&amp;t;
      wireless services common stock held by at&amp;t; common stock group, to holders
      of at&amp;t; common  stock on a pro rata  basis.  on february  14,  2001,  at&amp;t;
      announced  its  intention  to  retain up to $3  billion  of shares of at&amp;t;
      wireless  services  for its own account  for sale or  exchange  within six
      months of the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory irs ruling.

          in  january   2001,   ntt   docomo,   a  leading   japanese   wireless
      communications company,  invested $9.8 billion in a security of at&amp;t; that,
      like at&amp;t; wireless group tracking  stock, is intended to reflect a portion
      of the financial  performance  and economic value of at&amp;t; wireless  group.
      at&amp;t; wireless group,  through at&amp;t; wireless group, llc, was allocated $6.2
      billion of the proceeds  from  docomo's  $9.8 billion  investment in at&amp;t.;
<page>
          at&amp;t;  retained  the remaining  $3.6  billion of the docomo  investment
      proceeds as consideration  for the reduction in at&amp;t;'s retained portion of
      at&amp;t; wireless group's value. following the split-off, this investment will
      be converted  into  approximately  16% of at&amp;t; wireless  services'  common
      shares. docomo also received warrants at an exercise price of $35 per at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  tracking  share   equivalent   that  would  represent  an
      approximate additional 1.6% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common shares after
      the split-off.  as part of this investment,  at&amp;t; wireless group,  through
      at&amp;t; wireless  services,  inc., has entered into a strategic alliance with
      docomo  to  develop  mobile  multimedia  services  on  a  global-standard,
      high-speed  wireless  network.  docomo may require the  repurchase  of its
      investment at docomo's  original  purchase price,  plus interest,  if at&amp;t;
      does not complete the split-off by specified  dates  beginning  january 1,
      2002,  or if at&amp;t;  wireless  group fails to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.

      basis of presentation

          at&amp;t; wireless group is an integrated  business of at&amp;t.;  at&amp;t; wireless
      group includes the results of its mobility and fixed wireless  businesses,
      as well as its  international  operations,  which  primarily  include  the
      earnings or losses  associated  with  equity  interests  in  international
      wireless communications ventures and partnerships.  the combined financial
      statements reflect the results of operations,  financial position, changes
      in combined attributed net assets and cash flows of at&amp;t; wireless group as
      if it were a separate  entity for all  periods  presented.  the  financial
      information  included  herein may not  necessarily  reflect  the  combined
      results  of  operations,  financial  position,  changes in equity and cash
      flows of at&amp;t; wireless  group had it been a separate,  stand-alone  entity
      during the periods presented.  the combined  financial  statements of at&amp;t;
      wireless group should be read in conjunction with at&amp;t;'s form 10-k for the
      year ended december 31, 2000.

          the combined  financial  statements of at&amp;t; wireless  group conform to
      generally   accepted   accounting   principles.   the  combined  financial
      statements reflect the assets, liabilities,  revenue and expenses directly
      attributable  to  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  as well  as  allocations  deemed
      reasonable by management, to present the results of operations,  financial
      position and cash flows of at&amp;t; wireless group on a stand-alone basis. the
      allocation  methodologies  have  been  described  within  the notes to the
      combined financial statements where appropriate.

          the combined  financial  statements of at&amp;t; wireless  group  primarily
      include the legal entity results of at&amp;t; wireless  services,  inc. and its
      subsidiaries (aws), at&amp;t; wireless group, llc (awg), at&amp;t; wireless pcs, llc
      and its  subsidiaries  (awpcs),  and winston,  inc.  and its  subsidiaries
      (winston),  all of which were direct  subsidiaries  of at&amp;t;  corp.,  as of
      december 31, 2000.  in february  2001,  the legal  entities of winston and
      awpcs as well as  certain  assets  of awg  were  transferred  to aws.  the
      remaining  assets and liabilities of awg will be transferred  prior to the
      split-off.

          the april 2000 offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock resulted
      in net  proceeds  to at&amp;t;,  after  deducting  underwriter's  discount  and
      related fees and expenses,  of $10.3 billion. at&amp;t; attributed $7.0 billion
      of the  net  proceeds  to  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  in the  form  of a note
      receivable,  which was repaid by  december  31,  2000,  primarily  to fund
      acquisitions and capital expenditures. interest on the note receivable was
      calculated  based upon the average  daily  balance  outstanding  at a rate
      equal to the one month london  interbank  offered  rate (libor)  minus six
      basis  points,  a rate intended to be equivalent to the rate at&amp;t; wireless
      group would receive if it were a stand-alone entity.

      1. background and basis of presentation (continued)

          prior to the  offering of  at&amp;t; wireless  group  tracking  stock,  the
      capital  structure  of at&amp;t;  wireless  group had been  assumed  based upon
      at&amp;t;'s historical capital ratio adjusted for certain items. in determining
      the allocation  between short- and long-term debt and preferred  stock, we
      considered  factors such as  prospective  financing  requirements  for the
      business,  working capital commitments and future  requirements,  and peer
      group  analysis.  this  resulted in $3.4 billion in long-term  debt due to
      at&amp;t; at december 31, 1999,  paying annual  interest at 7.25%. in addition,
      as of december 31, 1999,  at&amp;t; wireless group had issued and  outstanding,
      $1.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred stock held by at&amp;t; that,  subject
      to the  approval  of at&amp;t;  wireless  group  capital  stock  committee,  is
      redeemable at the option of at&amp;t.; the preferred  stock is included  within
      "combined  attributed  net assets" on the  accompanying  combined  balance
      sheets.  on may 1, 2000,  following  the offering of at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      tracking  stock,  $2.0  billion  of  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's   outstanding
      long-term debt to at&amp;t; was  recapitalized  into an additional $2.0 billion
      of 9% cumulative  preferred stock issued to at&amp;t.; in conjunction  with the
      recapitalization, the remaining long-term debt due to at&amp;t; of $1.8 billion
      was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a fixed
      rate of 8.1% per annum.  the interest rate is intended to be substantially
      equivalent to the interest rate that at&amp;t; wireless  group would be able to
      obtain  from  third   parties,   including  the  public   markets,   as  a
      non-affiliate of at&amp;t; without the benefit of any guaranty by at&amp;t.;

          during  december 2000, at&amp;t; wireless  group,  through aws,  obtained a
      short-term revolving loan from at&amp;t;, which is included in "short-term debt
      due to at&amp;t;" in the accompanying  combined balance sheets. at december 31,
      2000,  the amount  outstanding  under the loan was $638,  paying  interest
      monthly at the average seven-day commercial paper rate, which was 8.37% at
      december 31, 2000.  the revolving  loan matures on december 29, 2001.  the
      loan was repaid in full in january 2001.

          changes  in  combined  attributed  net  assets  prior to the  offering
      primarily  represented net transfers to or from at&amp;t;,  after giving effect
      to the net income or loss of at&amp;t;  wireless  group during the period,  and
      were  assumed to be  settled in cash.  at&amp;t;'s  capital  contributions  for
      purchase business  combinations and initial  investments in joint ventures
      and  partnerships  which at&amp;t;  attributed to at&amp;t; wireless group have been
      treated as noncash transactions prior to the offering.

          at&amp;t; performs cash management functions on behalf of the at&amp;t; wireless
      group.  substantially  all of the at&amp;t; wireless  group's cash balances are
      swept to at&amp;t; on a daily  basis,  where they are managed  and  invested by
      at&amp;t.;  prior to the offering of the at&amp;t; wireless  group  tracking  stock,
      transfers  of cash to and from  at&amp;t;  were  reflected  as a  component  of
      combined  attributed  net  assets,  with no  interest  income  or  expense
      reflected. subsequent to the offering, transfers were reflected as changes
      in the note  receivable  from or  short-term  debt  payable to at&amp;t.;  cash
      balances  maintained  and reported by the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  primarily
      represent cash balances for which no right of offset exists with at&amp;t.;

      1. background and basis of presentation (continued)

          general  corporate  overhead related to at&amp;t;'s corporate  headquarters
      and common support  divisions has been allocated to at&amp;t; wireless group as
      it was not deemed  practicable to specifically  identify such common costs
      to at&amp;t; wireless group.  these allocations were based on the ratio of at&amp;t;
      wireless  group's  external  costs and  expenses  to  at&amp;t;'s  consolidated
      external costs and expenses, adjusted for any functions that at&amp;t; wireless
      group performs on its own. however, the costs of these services charged to
      at&amp;t; wireless group are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would
      have been incurred if at&amp;t; wireless  group had performed  these  functions
      entirely as a stand-alone  entity,  nor are they  indicative of costs that
      will be charged or incurred in the future.

          consolidated  income tax provision,  related tax payments or  refunds,
      and  deferred tax  balances of at&amp;t; have been  allocated to at&amp;t;  wireless
      group based  principally  on the taxable  income and tax credits  directly
      attributable  to at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  these  allocations  reflect  at&amp;t;
      wireless group's  contribution to at&amp;t;'s  consolidated  taxable income and
      the consolidated  tax liability and tax credit  position.  the at&amp;t; common
      stock  group and at&amp;t;  wireless  group  have  entered  into a tax  sharing
      agreement that provides for tax sharing payments based on the taxes or tax
      benefits of a  hypothetical  affiliated  group  consisting  of at&amp;t; common
      stock  group  and  at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  based  on this  agreement,  the
      consolidated tax liability before credits is allocated between the groups,
      based on each group's  contribution to consolidated  taxable income of the
      hypothetical  group.  for  purposes of the tax sharing  agreement,  the 9%
      cumulative  preferred  stock  held  by at&amp;t;  is  treated  as if it were an
      intercompany  debt instrument and,  accordingly,  tax sharing payments are
      calculated by treating  coupon payments on the preferred stock as interest
      expense to at&amp;t;  wireless  group and interest  income to at&amp;t; common stock
      group.  consolidated tax credits of the  hypothetical  group are allocated
      between groups based on each group's contribution to each tax credit.

      2. summary of significant accounting policies cash equivalents

          all highly liquid  investments  with original  maturities of generally
      three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

      cash flows

          for  purposes  of  the  combined   statements   of  cash  flows,   all
      transactions  between at&amp;t;  wireless  group and at&amp;t;,  except for purchase
      business  combinations  and  initial  investments  in joint  ventures  and
      partnerships  which were  funded by at&amp;t; and  contributed  by at&amp;t; to at&amp;t;
      wireless  group prior to the offering,  have been  accounted for as having
      been  settled in cash at the time the  transaction  was  recorded  by at&amp;t;
      wireless group.

      inventories

          inventories,  which consist  principally of handsets and  accessories,
      are  recorded  at the  lower  of  cost  or  market.  cost  is  principally
      determined by the first-in,  first-out (fifo) method. market is determined
      using replacement cost.

      2.  summary  of  significant   accounting  policies  (continued)

      property, plant and equipment

          property,  plant and equipment are recorded at cost,  unless impaired,
      and  depreciation is determined  based upon the assets'  estimated  useful
      lives.  depreciation is calculated on a  straight-line  basis according to
      the following useful lives:

          wireless communications systems and other equipment         3-15 years
          building and improvements                                   5-20 years

          when  at&amp;t;  wireless  group sells,  disposes  or retires  assets,  the
      related  gains or losses are included in operating  results.

          during 1998,  at&amp;t; wireless group completed  a review of the estimated
      service lives of certain wireless  communications  equipment. as a result,
      effective  january 1, 1998, the estimated  service lives of such equipment
      were changed from 12 years to varying periods ranging primarily from seven
      to ten years, with certain assets being changed to 15 years,  depending on
      the  nature of the  equipment.  the net  impact of these  changes  to 1998
      results was an annual  increase in depreciation  expense of  approximately
      $42 and an annual reduction in net income of  approximately  $26. see note
      14  for  further  discussion  associated  with  an  additional  change  in
      depreciable lives.

      software capitalization

          at&amp;t; wireless  group  capitalizes  certain  direct  development  costs
      associated with internal-use software,  including external direct costs of
      materials and services,  and payroll costs for employees  devoting time to
      the software  projects.  these costs are included  within other assets and
      are amortized  over a period not to exceed five years  beginning  when the
      asset  is   substantially   ready  for  use.  costs  incurred  during  the
      preliminary  project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are
      expensed  as  incurred.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  also  capitalizes  initial
      operating-system  software  costs and amortizes  them over the life of the
      associated hardware.

          at&amp;t;  wireless  group  also  capitalizes  costs  associated  with  the
      development of application  software incurred from the time  technological
      feasibility is established  until the software is ready to provide service
      to customers.  these capitalized costs are included in property, plant and
      equipment and are amortized over a useful life not to exceed five years.

      licensing costs

          licensing  costs are  primarily  incurred  to  acquire  cellular  (850
      megahertz) and pcs (1900 megahertz) licenses. in addition, licensing costs
      include costs incurred to acquire 38 gigahertz and 2.3 gigahertz licenses.
      amortization  begins with the  commencement of service to customers and is
      computed using the straight-line method over periods of 35 or 40 years.

      2.  summary  of  significant   accounting  policies  (continued)

      capitalized interest

          at&amp;t; wireless  group  capitalizes  interest which is applicable to the
      construction  of additions  to  property,  plant,  and  equipment  and the
      acquisitions  of licenses until the assets are placed into service.  these
      costs are amortized over the related assets' estimated useful lives.

      investments

          investments  in which at&amp;t; wireless  group,  primarily held by aws and
      awpcs,  exercises significant influence but which at&amp;t; wireless group does
      not control are  accounted for under the equity  method.  under the equity
      method,  investments  are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for at&amp;t;
      wireless  group's  subsequent  contributions  and its share of earnings or
      losses, and distributions.  the excess of the carrying value of investment
      over the  underlying  book  value of the  investee's  net  assets is being
      amortized over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years.

            investments   in  which  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  has  no  significant
      influence  over the  investee  are  accounted  for under the cost  method.
      investments  covered under the scope of statement of financial  accounting
      standards (sfas) no. 115,  "accounting for certain investments in debt and
      equity securities," are classified as "available for sale" and are carried
      at fair value. unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, are included within
      combined attributed net assets as "net revaluation of investments".

      goodwill

          goodwill  is the excess of the  purchase  price over the fair value of
      net assets acquired in business combinations  accounted for as a purchase.
      goodwill is amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods not exceeding
      40 years.

      valuation of long-lived assets

          long-lived  assets such as property,  plant and  equipment,  licensing
      costs,  goodwill,  investments and  capitalized  software are reviewed for
      impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the
      carrying  amount may not be  recoverable.  it is reasonably  possible that
      these assets could become impaired as a result of  technological  or other
      industry changes.  for assets at&amp;t; wireless group intends to hold for use,
      if the total of the expected future  undiscounted  cash flows is less than
      the carrying  amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference
      between the fair value and  carrying  value of the asset.  for assets at&amp;t;
      wireless  group intends to dispose of, a loss is recognized for the amount
      that the  estimated  fair  value,  less  costs to sell,  is less  than the
      carrying value of the assets.  in addition,  in accordance with accounting
      principles board opinion no. 17, "intangible  assets", at&amp;t; wireless group
      continues to evaluate the amortization periods to determine whether events
      or circumstances warrant revised amortization periods. additionally,  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  periodically  evaluates  the useful lives of its wireless
      communications   systems   and  other   equipment   based  on  changes  in
      technological and industry conditions.

      2.  summary  of  significant   accounting  policies  (continued)

      revenue recognition

          wireless  services revenue is recognized based upon minutes of traffic
      processed and contracted  fees.  customer  activation fees, along with the
      related costs,  are deferred and amortized over the customer  relationship
      period.  the  revenue  and related  expenses  associated  with the sale of
      wireless  handsets and  accessories  are recognized  when the products are
      delivered  and accepted by the  customer,  as this is  considered  to be a
      separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services. during 2000,
      we adopted  securities and exchange  commission staff accounting  bulletin
      no. 101, "revenue recognition in financial  statements".  the adoption did
      not have a material  impact on our  results  of  operations  or  financial
      condition.

      advertising and promotional costs

          costs  of  advertising   and  promotions  are  expensed  as  incurred.
      advertising and promotional  expenses were $618,  $386, and $344, in 2000,
      1999 and 1998, respectively.

      income taxes

         at&amp;t; wireless  group is not a separate  taxable  entity for federal and
      state income tax purposes  and its results of  operations  are included in
      the  consolidated  federal  and state  income tax  returns of at&amp;t; and its
      affiliates. at&amp;t; wireless group's provision or benefit for income taxes is
      based upon its  contribution  to the overall  income tax liability of at&amp;t;
      and its affiliates as described in note 1.

      issuance of common stock by affiliates

          changes in at&amp;t; wireless group's proportionate share of the underlying
      equity of a subsidiary  or equity method  investee,  which result from the
      issuance of additional equity securities by such entity, are recognized as
      increases or decreases in combined attributed net assets.

      use of estimates

          the  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally
      accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the
      financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the period reported.
      actual results could differ from those estimates.  estimates are used when
      accounting for certain items such as the allowance for doubtful  accounts,
      depreciation and amortization,  taxes,  valuation of investments and asset
      impairment and restructuring charges.

      reclassifications

          certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior  year  amounts  to
      conform with current year presentations.

      2.  summary  of  significant   accounting  policies  (continued)

      concentrations

          at&amp;t; wireless  group  purchases a substantial  portion of its wireless
      infrastructure  equipment from three major suppliers.  additionally,  four
      primary  vendors  provide at&amp;t; wireless  group's  multi-network  handsets.
      further, at&amp;t; wireless group relies on one vendor to provide substantially
      all  of its  billing  services.  loss  of any  of  these  suppliers  could
      adversely  impact  operations  temporarily  until a comparable  substitute
      could be found.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  does not have a  concentration  of
      available sources of labor or services,  nor does at&amp;t; wireless group have
      any  significant  concentration  of business  transacted with a particular
      customer, that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact operations.

      3. recent accounting pronouncements

          in september  2000, the financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb)
      issued sfas no. 140,  "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial
      assets and extinguishments of liabilities--a replacement of fasb no. 125".
      this statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
      and  servicing of financial  assets and  extinguishments  of  liabilities.
      under these  standards,  after a transfer of financial  assets,  an entity
      recognizes  the  financial  and  servicing  assets  it  controls  and  the
      liabilities it has incurred,  derecognizes  financial  assets when control
      has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. this
      statement provides  consistent  standards for distinguishing  transfers of
      financial   assets  that  are  sales  from   transfers  that  are  secured
      borrowings.  this  statement is effective  for  transfers and servicing of
      financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring after march
      31, 2001.  at&amp;t;  wireless  group does not expect that the adoption of sfas
      no.  140  will  have a  material  impact  on its  results  of  operations,
      financial position or cash flows.

          in  june  1998,  the   fasb  issued  sfas  no.  133,  "accounting  for
      derivative instruments and hedging activities". among other provisions, it
      requires  that  entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either assets or
      liabilities  in the  statement  of financial  position  and measure  those
      instruments at fair value.  gains and losses resulting from changes in the
      fair values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the
      use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge  accounting.  the
      effective  date of this  standard was delayed via the issuance of sfas no.
      137. the effective date for sfas no. 133 is now for fiscal years beginning
      after june 15, 2000, though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive
      application is prohibited.  for at&amp;t; wireless  group,  this means that the
      standard must be adopted no later than january 1, 2001. in june 2000,  the
      fasb issued sfas no. 138,  "accounting for certain derivative  instruments
      and certain  hedging  activities"  as an amendment  to sfas no. 133.  this
      statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
      issues  under sfas no. 133 on specific  types of hedges.  the  adoption of
      sfas no. 133 in january 2001,  did not have a material  impact to the at&amp;t;
      wireless group's results of operations,  financial position or cash flows.
      in  addition,  based on the types of contracts  we  currently  have,  at&amp;t;
      wireless group does not anticipate that this standard will have a material
      impact on future results of at&amp;t; wireless group.

      4. acquisitions and dispositions

          during 2000, 1999 and 1998,  at&amp;t; wireless  group,  through aws, awpcs
      and  winston,  completed  certain  transactions  as  part  of its  overall
      strategy to expand its wireless  footprint  and divest  itself of non core
      interests.  the net pretax  gains  recognized  were $362,  $99 and $600 in
      2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  the pretax gains and losses from the
      sale and  exchange  transactions  are  included  in "other  income" in the
      accompanying   combined  statements  of  operations.   a  summary  of  the
      significant transactions follows.

          in november  1998,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through aws, and bellsouth
      combined their jointly owned cellular  properties in los angeles,  houston
      and  galveston,  texas,  plus cash, to form ab cellular  holding,  llc (ab
      cellular),  which owned,  controlled and supervised all three  properties.
      at&amp;t; wireless group held a 55.62% equity interest in ab cellular, however,
      held a 50% voting interest,  therefore,  this investment was accounted for
      under the equity  method.  pursuant to the ab cellular  limited  liability
      company   agreement,   there  were  redemption   provisions  that  allowed
      bellsouth,  commencing in december 2000, to alter the ownership  structure
      of ab  cellular  pursuant  to one of three  options.  on december 4, 2000,
      bellsouth  announced its election to have ab cellular  exercise its option
      to redeem at&amp;t; wireless  group's 55.62% equity  interest.  on december 29,
      2000, ab cellular completed the redemption of at&amp;t; wireless group's 55.62%
      equity  interest in ab cellular,  and in exchange,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,
      through aws,  received 100% of the net assets of the los angeles  cellular
      property.  as a  result  of  the  redemption,  ab  cellular  recognized  a
      significant  gain on the transaction  based on the estimated fair value of
      the net  assets  of the  los  angeles  cellular  property  on the  date of
      redemption.  at&amp;t; wireless  group's net equity earnings for the year ended
      december 31, 2000, included $372 reflecting its proportionate share of the
      gain. the net assets of the los angeles cellular property were recorded at
      fair value and resulted in a pretax loss of $184 to at&amp;t;  wireless  group.
      the excess of the fair value of the los angeles cellular property over the
      fair  value  of net  tangible  assets  received,  based  on a  preliminary
      allocation,  totaled  $3,174 and has been  assigned  to  licensing  costs,
      goodwill and other  intangible  assets and is being amortized over periods
      of five to 40 years. we may make refinements to the allocation of the fair
      value of assets  acquired  in future  periods  as the  related  fair value
      appraisals of certain assets and liabilities are finalized. as a result of
      this  transaction,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  results  include  a  non-cash
      reduction to investments of $3,756,  associated with the redemption of its
      equity interest in ab cellular.

          on  november 13, 2000,  telecorp pcs, inc.  (telecorp)  completed  its
      merger  agreement  with  tritel,  inc.,  as part  of a stock  transaction.
      pursuant  to the  terms  of the  agreement,  each  company  merged  with a
      separate newly formed  subsidiary of a new holding  company named telecorp
      pcs, inc., upon consummation of the transaction. prior to the merger, at&amp;t;
      wireless group,  through awpcs,  held equity interests in each of telecorp
      and  tritel  which  were  both  affiliates  of  at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  in
      connection  with the merger,  at&amp;t; wireless group  contributed to telecorp
      pcs, inc., rights to acquire wireless licenses in wisconsin and iowa, paid
      approximately  $20 in cash  and  extended  the term of its  brand  license
      agreement  through july 2005,  in exchange for  approximately  9.3 million

      4. acquisitions and dispositions (continued)

      additional common shares in the newly combined  company.  this transaction
      brought at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  equity  stake in the combined  company to
      approximately  23%,  assuming the conversion of all currently  convertible
      preferred stock to common stock. in a separate  transaction with telecorp,
      at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through  awpcs,  completed  an exchange of certain
      wireless  licenses  and  rights  to  acquire  additional  licenses  in the
      wisconsin  and  iowa   markets,   as  well  as  made  a  cash  payment  of
      approximately $80. in return,  at&amp;t; wireless group received telecorp's pcs
      licenses  and  wireless  systems  in  several  new  england  markets.  the
      acquisition   of  the  wireless   systems  was  recorded  as  a  purchase.
      accordingly,  the operating results have been included in the accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. the excess of
      aggregate  fair value of total assets  acquired over the fair value of net
      tangible assets acquired, based on a preliminary allocation,  totaled $268
      and has been assigned to licensing  costs,  goodwill and other  intangible
      assets  and is being  amortized  over  periods  of five to 40 years.  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  recognized  a pretax gain of $379  associated  with these
      transactions.

      acquisition of a wireless system in indianapolis for approximately $530 in
      cash.  the  transaction  was  recorded  as a  purchase.  accordingly,  the
      operating  results of indianapolis  have been included in the accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. the excess of
      aggregate  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of net  tangible  assets
      acquired,  based on a  preliminary  allocation,  totaled $494 and has been
      assigned to licensing costs,  goodwill and other intangible  assets and is
      being amortized over periods of five to 40 years. we may make  refinements
      to the allocations of the purchase prices in future periods as the related
      fair value appraisals of certain assets and liabilities are finalized.

          on june 19, 2000,  at&amp;t; wireless  group  announced  that it had signed
      definitive agreements to acquire wireless systems in the san francisco bay
      area, san diego and houston.  on december 29, 2000,  at&amp;t; wireless  group,
      through aws and awpcs, completed the acquisition of the wireless system in
      houston for  approximately  $1.0 billion in cash.  on september  29, 2000,

      billion in cash,  thereby  giving  at&amp;t;  wireless  group a 100%  ownership
      interest  in  this  partnership.   these  transactions  were  recorded  as
      purchases.  accordingly,  the operating  results of the acquired  entities
      have been included in the accompanying combined financial statements since
      their dates of  acquisition.  the excess of aggregate  purchase price over

      goodwill and other  intangible  assets and is being amortized over periods
      of five to 40 years.  we may make  refinements  to the  allocations of the
      purchase prices in future periods as the related fair value  appraisals of
      certain assets and  liabilities  are finalized.  prior to  consummation of
      this  transaction,  at&amp;t; wireless  group's 50%  ownership  interest in cmt

      5. asset impairment and restructuring charges (continued)

          the planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure equipment
      required an  evaluation of asset  impairment  in accordance  with sfas no.
      121,   "accounting  for  the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets  and  for
      long-lived  assets to be disposed of," to write-down these assets to their
      fair value,  which was estimated by discounting  the expected  future cash
      flows  to be  generated  by  these  assets  from  their  use and  eventual
      disposition through the date of disposal.  since the assets will remain in
      service  from the date of the  decision to dispose of these  assets to the
      disposal   date,   the   impairment   has  been  recorded  as  accumulated
      depreciation  and the  remaining  net  book  value of the  assets  will be
      depreciated  over  this  shortened   period.  as  of  december  31,  2000,
      approximately  $320 of the asset impairment  reserve has been utilized for
      assets that have been  disposed of and written off. the remaining net book
      value of these assets was  approximately  $23 at december 31, 2000,  which
      will be depreciated over an estimated remaining useful life of 3 months.

          during 1998,  at&amp;t; wireless group  recorded a pretax asset  impairment
      charge of $120, which  represented the write-down of unrecoverable  assets
      associated with nonstrategic businesses.

      investments in ventures and partnerships  that provide at&amp;t; wireless group
      access  to  additional   domestic  and  international   wireless  markets.

      investments  of $3,080 and $4,409,  respectively.  amortization  of excess
      carrying value of $25, $19 and $52 in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively,
      is  reflected as a component  of net equity  earnings in the  accompanying

      7. investments (continued)

      (7) during the fourth quarter of 1998,  at&amp;t; wireless group sold,  through
          awpcs,  a  portion  of its  net  assets  in the  geographic  areas  of
          cincinnati and dayton,  ohio,  including portions of the pcs licenses,
          to cincinnati bell wireless,  llc for cash and an ownership  interest.
          the effect of this transaction resulted in a non-cash reclassification
          of license balances of approximately $20 to investments.

      (8) during november 2000, at&amp;t; wireless group,  through awpcs, joined with
          others in the  formation of a venture,  alaska native  wireless,  llc,
          which  participated in the federal  communication  commissions' recent
          auction of license  spectrum in the 1900 megahertz band, which is used
          to provide wireless services.  at&amp;t; wireless group provided funding to
          the joint venture  through a combination of a  non-controlling  equity
          interest  and debt  securities  of  alaska  native  wireless  totaling
          approximately  $229 as of december 31, 2000.  at&amp;t; wireless  group has
          made certain future  commitments  related to this joint  venture.  see
          note 12 for further discussion of outstanding commitments.

      (9) in august  1999,  at&amp;t; and  british  telecommunications  plc through a
          newly  created joint venture  acquired a 33.3%  ownership  interest in
          rogers wireless  communications,  inc.,  formerly rogers cantel mobile
          communications, inc., for approximately $934 in cash. at&amp;t; contributed
          its  interest in the joint  venture to at&amp;t;  wireless  group as of the
          date of acquisition.  the investment is owned equally by at&amp;t; wireless
          group,   through  aws,  and  british   telecommunications   plc.  this
          investment  is accounted  for under the equity  method  because of our
          ability to elect  certain  members of the board of  directors  of this
          entity, which we believe provides us with significant influence.

      (10)in the first  quarter  of 2000,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  was  allocated
          one-half of at&amp;t;'s interest in japan telecom,  which is held through a
          joint venture with british  telecommunications plc. this investment is
          accounted for under the equity method  because of our ability to elect
          certain  members of the board of directors  of this  entity,  which we
          believe  provides  us  with  significant  influence.  see  note 14 for
          discussion of subsequent events associated with japan telecom.

      (11)on october 2, 2000,  at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws,  completed its
          acquisition of several interests in international ventures,  including
          eurotel praha in the czech  republic,  acquired by at&amp;t; as a result of
          its acquisition of mediaone in june 2000. at&amp;t; wireless group acquired
          these interests from at&amp;t; for  approximately $1 billion in cash, which
          was determined based upon a third party valuation.  additionally, at&amp;t;
          wireless group assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately
          $200 which were transferred from at&amp;t.;

      (12)on december 8, 2000, at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws,  exercised its
          options  to  purchase   additional  shares  of  stock  in  its  equity
          investment in far eastone telecommunications, ltd. at&amp;t; wireless group
          paid  approximately  $205 for the additional  shares and increased its
          ownership percentage to 22.70%.

          at&amp;t; wireless group also has investments  accounted for under the cost
      method of accounting.  under this method,  investments are stated at cost,
      and earnings are  recognized to the extent  distributions  are received in
      excess of accumulated earnings of the investee.  distributions received in
      excess of  accumulated  earnings  are  recognized  as a  reduction  of our
      investment balance.  these investments,  which are covered under the scope
      of sfas no. 115, "accounting  for certain  investments in  debt and equity
      securities,"  are  classified as  "available-for-sale"  and are carried at
      fair value with any  unrealized  gain or loss,  net of tax, being included
      within  our  other  comprehensive   income  as  a  component  of  combined
      attributed net assets.

      8. income taxes

          at&amp;t; wireless group is  not a separate taxable  entity for federal and
      state income tax purposes  and its results of  operations  are included in
      the  consolidated  federal  and state  income tax  returns of at&amp;t; and its
      affiliates,  as  described  in note  1.  the  following  table  shows  the
      principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate
      and the united states federal statutory income tax rate:

          deferred  income tax liabilities are taxes at&amp;t; wireless group expects
      to pay in future  periods.  similarly,  deferred  income  tax  assets  are
      recorded  for  expected  reductions  in taxes  payable in future  periods.
      deferred  income taxes arise  because of  differences  in the book and tax
      bases of certain assets and liabilities.

          at december 31,  2000,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group had net  operating  loss
      carryforwards  for federal and state  income tax purposes of $21 and $619,
      respectively,  expiring through 2019. at&amp;t; wireless group also has federal
      tax credit carryforwards of $29 which are not subject to expiration.  at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  recorded a valuation  allowance to reflect the  estimated
      amount of deferred  tax assets  which,  more likely than not,  will not be
      realized by at&amp;t; wireless group.

          the  realization of at&amp;t; wireless  group's  deferred tax assets is not
      dependent  upon the  consolidated  tax  group of at&amp;t.;  on a stand  alone,
      separate  company  basis,  at&amp;t; wireless  group has  sufficient  reversing
      taxable temporary  differences to warrant  recognition of its deferred tax
      assets  without  the need for any  additional  valuation  allowance.  at&amp;t;
      wireless group received  payments under its tax sharing  arrangement  with
      at&amp;t; for the net domestic tax losses and credits it had  generated.  these
      payments were recorded as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

      8. income taxes (continued)

          at&amp;t;  previously  announced that it intends to split-off at&amp;t; wireless
      group (see note 1). if it were  determined  that the  split-off  failed to
      qualify as a tax-free transaction,  a tax liability would be created which
      would have a material effect on at&amp;t; wireless  group.  in addition,  there
      may be tax costs  associated  with the  split-off  that  result  from at&amp;t;
      wireless group ceasing to be a member of the at&amp;t;  consolidated tax return
      group, as well as from pre-split  transactions,  if incurred,  these costs
      could be material to at&amp;t; wireless group's results.

      9. employee benefit plan

          at&amp;t;  wireless  group  sponsors a savings plan for the majority of its
      employees.  the plan allows  employees  to  contribute  a portion of their
      pretax income in accordance with specified guidelines.  the plan matches a
      percentage of employee  contributions  up to certain limits.  in addition,
      at&amp;t;   wireless   group  may  make   discretionary   or   profit   sharing
      contributions.  contributions  amounted to $60, $37 and $31 in 2000,  1999
      and 1998, respectively.

      10. stock-based compensation plans

          under the at&amp;t; 1997 long-term  incentive program (program),  which was
      effective june 1, 1997, and amended on may 19, 1999 and on march 14, 2000,
      at&amp;t; grants stock options,  performance shares, restricted stock and other
      awards on at&amp;t;  common  stock as well as stock  options  on at&amp;t;  wireless
      group tracking stock.

          under the  program,  there  were 150  million  shares of common  stock
      available  for grant with a maximum of 22.5  million  common  shares  that
      could be used for awards other than stock options.  beginning with january
      1, 2000, the remaining  shares  available for grant at december 31, of the
      prior year,  plus 1.75% of the shares of at&amp;t; common stock  outstanding on
      january 1 of each year become  available for grant.  there is a maximum of
      37.5 million  shares that may be used for awards other than stock options.
      the  exercise  price of any stock  option is equal to the stock price when
      the option is  granted.  generally,  the  options  vest over three or four
      years and are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant.

          under  the  program,  performance  share  units  are  awarded  to  key
      employees  in the  form of  either  common  stock  or cash at the end of a
      three-year  period  based on at&amp;t;'s total  shareholder  return and certain
      financial performance targets. under the 1987 long-term incentive program,
      performance  share  units  with the same  terms  were also  awarded to key
      employees  based on at&amp;t;'s  return-to-equity  performance  compared with a
      target.

      10. stock-based compensation plans (continued)

          on april 27, 2000 at&amp;t;  created a new class of stock and  completed an
      offering  of at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracking  stock.  under the program as
      amended on march 14,  2000,  5% of the  outstanding  at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      tracking shares became  available for grant with a maximum of 1.25% of the
      outstanding  shares  that  may be used  for  awards  other  than  options.
      beginning  with january 1, 2001 the remaining  at&amp;t; wireless  group shares
      available  for  grant  at  december  31 of the  prior  year  plus  2.0% of
      outstanding  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking shares on january 1 of each year
      become  available  for grant.  the  exercise  price of any stock option is
      equal to the stock  price  when the  option  is  granted.  generally,  the
      options vest over two to three and one half years and are  exercisable  up
      to 10 years from the date of grant. in 2000 there were no grants of awards
      other than stock  options.  on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; granted at&amp;t; wireless
      group tracking stock options to  substantially  all at&amp;t; and at&amp;t; wireless
      group employees.

          under the at&amp;t; 1996 employee  stock  purchase  plan (plan),  which was
      effective  july 1,  1996,  at&amp;t; is  authorized  to issue up to 75  million
      shares of at&amp;t; common stock to its eligible employees.  under the terms of
      the  plan,  employees  may have up to 10% of their  earnings  withheld  to
      purchase at&amp;t;'s common stock.  the purchase price of the stock on the date
      of exercise  is 85% of the  average  high and low sale prices of shares on
      the new york  stock  exchange  for that day.  under  the  plan,  at&amp;t; sold
      approximately  1,127 thousand  shares to at&amp;t; wireless group  employees in
      2000,  approximately  424 thousand  shares in 1999 and  approximately  535
      thousand shares in 1998.

          at&amp;t; and at&amp;t; wireless group apply accounting principles board opinion
      no.  25,   "accounting   for  stock  issued  to  employees,"  and  related
      interpretations in accounting for its plans. accordingly,  no compensation
      expense has been recognized for its stock-based  compensation  plans other
      than  for   performance-based   and  restricted  stock  awards  and  stock
      appreciation  rights  (sars).  compensation  costs  charged  against  at&amp;t;
      wireless group's results of operations for at&amp;t; performance-based  awards,
      restricted  stock awards and sars for at&amp;t; wireless  group  employees were
      not material in any periods presented.

          at&amp;t;  and  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  have  adopted  the   disclosure-only
      provisions of sfas no. 123, "accounting for stock-based  compensation." if
      at&amp;t; wireless group had elected to recognize  compensation  costs based on
      the  fair  value at the date of grant  for  at&amp;t;  awards  granted  to at&amp;t;
      wireless  group  employees in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  and for at&amp;t; wireless
      group awards granted to at&amp;t; wireless group employees in 2000,  consistent
      with the  provisions  of sfas no. 123,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's net income
      (loss) would have been adjusted to reflect additional compensation expense
      resulting in the following pro forma amounts:

      10. stock-based compensation plans (continued)


          the pro forma effect on net income for 1998 may not be  representative
      of the pro forma effect on net income  (loss) of future years  because the
      sfas no. 123 method of accounting for pro forma  compensation  expense has
      not been applied to options  granted prior to january 1, 1995, as all such
      options were fully vested by the end of 1998.

          there were  approximately  53,308  thousand at&amp;t; wireless  group stock
      options granted to at&amp;t; wireless group employees  during 2000. at the date
      of grant the weighted- average exercise price of these options granted was
      $29.23.  the  weighted-average  fair value at date of grant was $14.43 and
      was estimated using the black-scholes  option-pricing model. the following
      weighted-average assumptions were applied: (i) expected volatility rate of
      55.0%, (ii) expected life of 4 years and (iii) risk-free  interest rate of
      6.52%.

          at&amp;t; granted  approximately 1,082 thousand, 9,438 thousand  and 10,503
      thousand stock options to at&amp;t; wireless group employees  during 2000, 1999
      and  1998,  respectively.  at the  date  of  grant,  the  weighted-average
      exercise price for at&amp;t; options  granted to at&amp;t; wireless group  employees
      during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $48.05,  $59.35 and $41.86,  respectively.
      the weighted-average fair values at date of grant for at&amp;t; options granted
      to at&amp;t; wireless group  employees  during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $14.26,
      $15.36 and $9.80, respectively, and were estimated using the black-scholes
      option-pricing  model.  the following  weighted-average  assumptions  were
      applied  for 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively:  (i)  expected  dividend
      yields of 1.7%,  1.7% and 2.1%, (ii) expected  volatility  rates of 31.2%,
      27.2% and 23.8%,  and (iii) risk-free  interest rates of 6.69%,  4.71% and
      5.27% and (iv) expected lives of 3.9 years, 4.9 years and 4.5 years.

      11. fair values of financial instruments

          the  carrying   amounts  of  cash  and  cash   equivalents,   accounts
      receivable,   accounts  payable  and  other  current   liabilities  are  a
      reasonable  estimate of their fair value due to the  short-term  nature of
      these instruments. the fair value of the short-term and long-term debt due
      to at&amp;t; approximates its carrying value.

      12.commitments and contingencies

          in the normal course of business,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group is subject to
      proceedings,  lawsuits and other claims.  such matters are subject to many
      uncertainties   and  outcomes   are  not   predictable   with   assurance.
      consequently,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group is unable to  ascertain  the ultimate
      aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to
      these matters at december 31, 2000. at&amp;t; wireless group also makes routine
      filings with the federal  communications  commission and state  regulatory
      authorities.  these matters could affect the operating  results of any one
      quarter when resolved in future  periods.  however,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group
      believes that after final disposition any monetary  liability or financial
      impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end would not be material to
      our annual combined financial statements.

      12. commitments and contingencies (continued)

          during january 2001,  at&amp;t; closed its previously  announced  agreement
      with docomo. pursuant to this agreement, docomo may require the repurchase
      of its investment at docomo's original  purchase price, plus interest,  if
      at&amp;t; does not complete the split-off by specified dates beginning  january
      1, 2002, or if at&amp;t; wireless group fails to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.  see  note 1 for  further  discussion  related  to the  docomo
      investment.

          at&amp;t; wireless group has entered into various purchase  commitments for
      network  equipment as well as handsets,  related to the development of its
      next-generation  strategy.  those commitments  totaled $432 as of december
      31, 2000. these commitments expire between 2001 and 2004.

          during  november  2000,  at&amp;t; wireless group joined with others in the
      formation of a venture, alaska native wireless,  which participated in the
      federal  communication  commission's recent auction of license spectrum in
      the 1900 megahertz band,  which is used to provide wireless  services.  in
      january 2001,  the auction was completed,  and alaska native  wireless was
      the high bidder on approximately  $2.9 billion in licenses.  at&amp;t; wireless
      group has committed to fund $2.6 billion to alaska native wireless to fund
      alaska  native  wireless'  purchase of licenses.  as of december 31, 2000,
      at&amp;t; wireless group funded  approximately $229 of the commitment through a
      combination of a  non-controlling  equity  interest and debt securities of
      alaska native  wireless.  additionally,  in february  2001,  at&amp;t; wireless
      group funded an additional $80. the remaining  approximate $2.3 billion of
      additional  funding will be made when such licenses are granted,  and will
      take the form of non-convertible  notes of alaska native wireless.  at the
      fifth  anniversary  of the first date on which licenses won in the auction
      are granted to alaska native  wireless,  and in addition to other means by
      which they may transfer their interests, the other owners of alaska native
      wireless have the right to require at&amp;t; wireless  group to purchase  their
      equity  interests.  if this right were  exercised five years after license
      grant, the purchase price could be as much as approximately $950 and would
      be  payable,  at at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  option,  in  cash or  marketable
      securities.  the right to require at&amp;t;  wireless  group to purchase  these
      interests may be exercised before the five-year anniversary of the license
      grant if the conditions of certain fcc  regulations  restricting  the free
      transferability  of  certain  licenses  offered  in this  auction  are met
      earlier. if the right were exercised earlier,  the purchase price would be
      calculated in generally the same way as if exercised at five years, except
      that a discount would be applied. in certain  circumstances,  if a winning
      bid of alaska native  wireless is rejected or if any license granted to it
      is revoked,  at&amp;t; wireless  group would be obligated to  compensate  other
      owners  for  making   capital   available  to  the  venture.   in  certain
      circumstances,  if the grant of the licenses is challenged,  at&amp;t; wireless
      group  may be  obligated  to  purchase  the  interests  of  other  owners.
      depending on when such revocation or challenge takes place, the amount may
      be material but will be less than the $950 purchase price described above.

          at&amp;t; wireless  group  leases land,  buildings  and  equipment  through
      contracts that expire in various years through 2037.  rental expense under
      operating leases was $271 in 2000, $205 in 1999, and $181 in 1998.     the
      following  table shows  the  future  minimum  rental  payments  due  under

         during  2000  and  1999,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  expensed  $28 and $82,
      respectively,  for losses  associated with commitments  related to certain
      equity  investments.  included  in the 1999 loss of $82 was at&amp;t;  wireless
      group's commitment of $63 to fund the long-term debt obligations of one of
      its equity  investments,  which  fully  satisfied  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's
      commitment for this equity investment.

          at&amp;t; wireless  group also has various other purchase  commitments  for
      materials,  supplies and other items  incidental to the ordinary course of
      business which are not significant individually, nor in the aggregate.

      13. related party transactions

         as  discussed in note 1, at&amp;t; has provided  necessary  working  capital
      requirements  to  at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  through  awg  and  aws,  via  an
      attribution of a portion of the offering  proceeds,  intercompany debt and
      preferred stock, as well as capital  contributions  prior to the offering.
      intercompany debt is reflected in the accompanying combined balance sheets
      as  "short-term  debt  due to  at&amp;t;"  and  "long-term  debt  due to  at&amp;t;"
      preferred  stock held by at&amp;t; is  included  in  "combined  attributed  net

      receivable.

         intercompany  interest  income on the note receivable from at&amp;t; for the
      year ended  december 31, 2000,  totaled  $143.  there was no  intercompany
      interest  income  for the years  ended  december  31,  1999 and 1998.  the
      intercompany  interest  income was determined  based upon the  methodology
      described  in  note  1  and  is  included   within  other  income  in  the
      accompanying combined statements of operations.

          intercompany  debt and  interest  expense was  assumed  based upon the
      methodology  discussed in note 1.  intercompany debt was $2,438 and $3,400
      at december  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  of which $638  represented
      short-term debt at december 31, 2000.  intercompany  interest  expense was
      $196,  $214,  and $190,  for the years ended  december 31, 2000,  1999 and
      1998,  respectively,  of which $123,  $88 and $75, was  capitalized  as of
      december 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

          the 9%  cumulative  preferred  stock held by at&amp;t; was $3.0 billion and
      $1.0  billion as of december 31, 2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  dividend
      requirements  were $130,  $56 and $56,  for the years ended  december  31,
      2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

      14. subsequent events

          in january 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group executed  agreements with certain
      network   equipment   vendors,   related   to  the   development   of  its
      next-generation  network strategy.  these agreements require at&amp;t; wireless
      group to buy equipment  from these  vendors  totaling  approximately  $1.8
      billion through 2004.

          effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group implemented the results
      of  a  review  of  the  estimated   service  lives  of  certain   wireless
      communications equipment,  primarily electronics.  lives were shortened to
      fully depreciate all such equipment within seven years.  similar equipment
      acquired  after  january 1, 2001,  will have  useful  lives no longer than
      seven years.

          on january 22, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws,  completed its
      previously  announced  transaction  with  docomo.  see note 1 for  further
      discussion of the transaction.

          on  november 17, 2000,  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  announced  that  at&amp;t;'s
      board of directors  had approved an  agreement  under which at&amp;t;  wireless
      group  would  purchase  $200 in  series aa  preferred  stock  from  dobson
      communications  corporation.  at&amp;t; wireless group,  through aws, completed

      group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  docomo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.
