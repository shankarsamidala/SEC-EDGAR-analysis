       notes   to   consolidated   financial   statements   (unaudited)

1.  the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three month and
    nine month periods ended september 30, 1999 and 1998 were not audited.
    however, in management's opinion, the information reflects all adjustments
    necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.
    management believes all adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  these consolidated financial statements should be read together with the
    1998 audited financial statements in bethlehem's annual report on form 10-k
    filed with the securities and exchange commission.

3.  on may 29, 1998, bethlehem acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
    lukens inc.  the aggregate purchase price of $560.6 million comprises cash
    of $327.8 million, the issuance of 15.1 million shares of bethlehem common
    stock valued at $184.8 million, and transaction related costs of $48.0
    million.  bethlehem paid $6.6 million of the transaction related costs
    during the first nine months of 1999.  the transaction was accounted for as
    a purchase and, accordingly, lukens' results are included in the
    consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

         the fair value (in millions) of the assets acquired and the
    liabilities assumed is as follows:

         in february 1999, bethlehem completed the sale of the stainless
    distribution business, washington specialty metals corporation for about
    $70 million.  in april 1999, bethlehem signed an agreement to sell the
    stainless sheet operations in massillon, ohio and washington, pennsylvania.
    the prospective buyer was unable to reach a labor agreement with the uswa
    for the washington facility.  negotiations continue for the massillon
    facility and are contingent on the prospective owner reaching a labor
    agreement with the uswa.  we are continuing with our efforts to sell the
    washington facility.  the stainless and distribution businesses were
    acquired with the purchase of lukens inc.  and are being accounted for as
    discontinued operations.  income or losses from these operations are not
    included in bethlehem's operating results.  since the date of acquisition,
    these operations have incurred operating losses of about $35 million.  the
    net assets of these operations are shown separately on the balance sheet
    and consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and working capital.

         bethlehem will finalize all purchase accounting adjustments upon
    completion of the sale of the stainless sheet operations described above.
    any future adjustments are not expected to materially affect the recorded
    values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, including the
    recorded amount of goodwill.

         the unaudited pro forma combined results (excluding stainless) for the
    first nine months of 1998 as if lukens had been acquired at the beginning
    of 1998 are estimated to be (dollars in millions, except per share data):

4.  on april 23, 1999 bethlehem entered into a construction financing
    arrangement for the conversion of a continuous slab casting strand at
    sparrows point to a wide slab casting strand.  the financing is for a
    maximum of $50 million with an interest rate of about 8% and a term of 16
    months.  as of september 30, 1999, bethlehem had borrowed about $19 million
    under the financing.  on july 21, 1999, bethlehem entered into a loan
    arrangement for $60 million at an interest rate of about 7 1/4% and a term
    of 18 months to finance a portion of the cold rolling complex at sparrows
    point.

         on june 17, 1999, bethlehem amended its existing non-reducing credit
    facility.  the amendment increases the size of the facility from $600
    million to $660 million by increasing the inventory credit agreement from
    $260 million to $320 million.  the size of the receivables purchase
    agreement remains at $340 million and the maturity of the facility remains
    june 19, 2003.

                          management's discussion and
           analysis of results of operations and financial condition


review of results:

third quarter and first nine months 1999
third quarter and first nine months 1998


         bethlehem reported a net loss of $90 million ($.77 per diluted share)
for the third quarter of 1999 compared with net income of $37 million ($.21 per
diluted share) for the third quarter of 1998.  results for the third quarter of
1999 include about $50 million ($41 million after tax) of additional operating
costs that were incurred in connection with the reline of the blast furnace at
sparrows point and certain other planned modernization and maintenance outages,
and with the temporary idling of production at our majority owned iron ore
operation located in hibbing, minnesota.  the hibbing operation was temporarily
idled in order to reduce iron ore inventories that were built up due to the
adverse effect that the high levels of steel imports have had on our steel
production and shipments.  sales for the third quarter of 1999 were $958
million compared with $1.14 billion for the third quarter of 1998.

         for the first nine months of 1999, our net loss was $145 million
($1.35 per diluted share) on sales of $2.90 billion compared with net income of
$143 million ($.92 per diluted share) on sales of $3.47 billion for the first
nine months of 1998.  results for the first nine months of 1999 include about
$70 million ($58 million after tax) of higher operating costs related to
outages taken for the extensive planned maintenance and modernization work
conducted in the second and third quarters and the temporary idling of
hibbing's iron ore operation in the third quarter.  results for the first nine
months of 1998 include a $35 million ($29 million after-tax) charge related to
the closing of our sparrows point plate mill.  excluding this charge, net
income for the first nine months of 1998 was $172 million ($1.15 per diluted
share).


operating results

         our loss from operations was $99 million for the third quarter of 1999
compared with income from operations of $59 million for the third quarter of
1998.  third quarter 1999 operating results declined from a year ago due to
significantly lower realized prices and higher costs.  costs were higher during
the third quarter of 1999 primarily due to the approximately $50 million of
higher operating costs that were incurred in connection with planned
modernization and maintenance outages, including the reline of our "l" blast
furnace at sparrows point, and the temporary idling of hibbing's iron ore
operation.

         our loss from operations for the first nine months of 1999 was $144
million compared with income from operations of $238 million (excluding the $35
million charge


                                            - 6 -

related to closing our sparrows point plate mill) for the first nine months of
1998.  results declined primarily due to significantly lower realized prices
and lower shipments, as well as approximately $70 million of higher costs
related to planned modernization and maintenance outages, and the temporary
idling of hibbing's iron ore operation.

         third quarter 1999 operating results declined from the $26 million
loss experienced in the second quarter of 1999 primarily due to higher costs.
costs were higher during the third quarter of 1999 primarily due to a larger
portion of the blast furnace reline occurring in the quarter and the other
costs discussed above.


liquidity and capital structure

         at september 30, 1999, total liquidity, comprising cash, cash
equivalents, and funds available under our bank credit arrangements, totaled
about $300 million compared with $479 million at december 31, 1998 and $430
million at september 30, 1998.

         for the first nine months of 1999, cash provided from operations
before pension activities was $161 million, compared with $419 million for the
first nine months of 1998.  other major sources of cash included new borrowings
of $237 million and asset sales of $94 million.  new borrowings included about
$160 million from the inventory credit agreement portion of our non-reducing
credit facility, use of about $56 million of our $60 million short-term loan
arrangement relating to a portion of our cold mill capital expenditures, and
about $19 million of our $50 million construction financing arrangement for the
wide slab casting strand project at sparrows point.  asset sales included $70
million from the sale of our stainless distribution business, washington
specialty metals corporation.

         principal uses of cash during the first nine months of 1999 included
capital expenditures of $447 million, debt repayments of $44 million and
pension funding of $36 million.  capital expenditures included the reline of
the "l" blast furnace, upgrades to the bof shop, construction of a new cold
mill complex, preliminary work for the conversion of a continuous slab casting
strand to a wide slab casting strand at sparrows point, our previously
announced joint ventures, columbus coatings company and columbus processing
company, and our previously announced equity interest in metalsite, an internet
marketplace where companies can buy and sell metal products and services.
capital expenditures also included certain improvements we made to the steckel
plate mill at bethlehem lukens plate (blp).  these improvements were made in
accordance with our agreement to provide conversion services to allegheny
teledyne.  after a relatively short period of time for startup, testing, and
becoming operational, we will receive a payment of $70 million from allegheny
teledyne in connection with their purchase of certain stainless assets from us
last year.

         capital expenditures are currently expected to be about $600 million
in 1999.  additionally, we expect to repay some of our outstanding borrowings
under our bank


                                          - 7 -









<page> 9

arrangements during the remainder of the year, and we plan to make additional
contributions to our pension trust, as appropriate.

         we expect to maintain an adequate level of liquidity during 1999 with
cash provided from operations, asset sales, project financings, reductions in
working capital, and available funds under our bank arrangements.


labor contract

         on august 6, 1999, the tentative labor agreement between bethlehem and
the uswa was ratified by the uswa membership.  we believe the new long-term,
five-year, labor agreement is a fair and reasonable contract that provides
stability to our customers, suppliers, employees, and stockholders.  the new
labor agreement provides bethlehem with a sound basis to advance our objective
of creating partnerships among employees and to improve our productivity and
overall competitiveness.


international steel trade

         the steel trade crisis continues to severely injure bethlehem.  both
shipment levels and prices remain depressed.  average steel prices for domestic
steel companies for all products in 1999 are down 7% from average 1998 steel
prices.  this is the largest aggregate decline in nearly 20 years.  overall
market steel price declines for domestic steel companies for hot rolled, cold
rolled, and plate were 8%, 7%, and 14%, respectively.  for bethlehem, a 1%
increase or decrease in average realized price per ton results in an increase
or decrease in net sales and pre-tax income of about $40 million.

         we will continue to take all appropriate legal actions.  currently, we
have cold rolled and cut-to-length plate cases pending.  our public affairs
activities are advancing with the stand up for steel campaign in coordination
with the uswa, other leading steel companies, and others.  our government
affairs actions are centered on working closely with the administration and
congress for the full and unyielding enforcement of u.s.  trade laws.  we
believe that all of these actions will in due course help to restore fair trade
in steel.


year 2000

         problems created by the once common programming practice of storing
date information using only the last two digits to indicate the year will
impact all businesses and government organizations as we approach the year
2000.  the scope of our year 2000 program involves many areas including our
business and manufacturing computing systems, the associated personal
computing, communications and infrastructure elements, and the year 2000
readiness of our key suppliers and customers.  the major elements

                                         - 8 -










<page> 10


of our program are inventory, risk assessment, remediation, testing, and
contingency planning.

         we have been actively working on resolving the year 2000 problem for
five years.  the effort was initiated with a large pilot project in late 1994
during which five percent of our business applications were converted to be
year 2000 compliant.  the pilot allowed us to develop a methodology for solving
our year 2000 problem as well as a structure for effective management and
timely correction of the problem within our systems.  in late 1997, we
conducted a 45-day test of converted business applications for business unit
and corporate systems as well as all operating system software in a full
simulation of the year 2000.  we reset the system clock for various dates and
tested the processing of date information before and after december 31, 1999,
as well as processing of the year 2000 as a leap year.  this test was completed
successfully and validated our processes and methods for addressing the year
2000 problem.  additional full-scale tests were conducted in december 1998,
january 1999, and march 1999.  the results of these additional tests were
positive and reinforced our approach for addressing the year 2000 problem.

         we continue to evaluate the readiness of our key suppliers and
customers.  starting in april 1998, we surveyed key suppliers, transportation
providers, financial partners, and electronic data interchange trading
partners.  to date, responses have been received from 97% of those surveyed and
we are currently confirming their compliance.  additionally, we have received
correspondence from over 700 key customers regarding their year 2000 readiness,
and we will continue to review their readiness.

         we have completed the year 2000 remediation of all critical functions.
we have replaced, repaired, or re- engineered all systems that could
significantly impact our ability to process orders, produce goods, provide
services, ensure product quality, and perform other critical functions.  our
focus is now on contingency planning and the final testing and verification of
systems.  year 2000 business continuity planning and contingency plans have
been completed at all of our facilities and offices.  we have prioritized
critical business processes, developed probable and worst case failure
scenarios, assessed the business impact of these potential failures, and
developed risk management strategies to mitigate these risks.  our risk
management strategies include operating, staffing, contingency, and triage
plans.  our plans address both internal and external risks.  strategies for
mitigating risk include the development of (1) operating and staffing plans for
the year 2000 rollover, (2) backup and/or alternate procedures, and (3)
inventory requirements based on customer and supplier assessments.  we are
developing alternate plans for those business partners who may not be year 2000
ready in significant areas and preparing contact lists and plans for working
with key business partners during the rollover period to ensure a swift
resolution to any problem.

         the costs associated with our year 2000 program continue to be at
planned levels.  the costs will be charged to normal operating expenses.  the
total estimated

                                           - 9 -










<page> 11

incremental cost of this activity is approximately $7 million.  we do not
expect to incur any extraordinary charges associated with the effort, and no
major computer projects have been deferred because of our year 2000 program.

         we believe that we have taken all reasonable steps to ensure our year
2000 readiness.  the success of our year 2000 program now depends, to a large
extent, on the year 2000 readiness of our key business partners and, if
necessary, the implementation of contingency plans.  these and other
unanticipated year 2000 issues could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition.


dividends

         on october 27, 1999, the board of directors declared dividends of
$1.25 per share on bethlehem's $5.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock,
$0.625 per share on bethlehem's $2.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock
and $0.875 per share on bethlehem's $3.50 cumulative convertible preferred
stock, each payable december 10, 1999, to holders of record on november 10,
1999.  no dividend was declared on bethlehem's common stock.


outlook

         the domestic economy continues on a course of moderate and sustainable
growth.  competition remains intense in all of our markets due to excess global
steel capacity, new domestic supply, and continuing high levels of plate
inventories in the marketplace resulting from high levels of unfairly traded
imports during this past year.  however, overall market conditions are
beginning to improve.  our order entry is increasing, and we believe our
current order book and better market demand will allow us the opportunity to
achieve some restoration of steel prices.  also, production has been resumed at
hibbing's iron ore operation.

         the planned modernization and maintenance work outages at sparrows
point and improvements to the steckel plate mill at blp are now, for the most
part, behind us and the affected facilities have returned to more normal
operations.  we believe that these projects, along with the completion of
sparrows point's new cold mill complex, wide slab caster, and pulverized coal
injection, which are all on schedule for completion next year, will result in
significant improvements to our competitiveness and profitability for the
longer term provided fair trade in steel is restored.

         we will continue our strategy of concentrating on steel and rebuilding
our financial strength, and we will take all necessary actions to reduce costs
and improve our overall competitiveness.

constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  in the absence of a
quorum at any such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments thereof, a
majority in voting interest of those present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote thereat, or in the absence therefrom of all the stockholders, any
officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting may
adjourn such meeting from time to time.  at any such adjourned meeting at which
a quorum may be present any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally called.  the absence from any meeting
of stockholders holding the number of shares of stock of the corporation
required by the laws of the state of delaware or by the second restated
certificate of incorporation of the corporation, as from time to time amended,
or by these by-laws for action upon any given matter shall not prevent action
at such meeting upon any other matter or matters which may properly come before
the meeting, if there shall be present thereat in person or by proxy
stockholders holding the number of shares of stock of the corporation required
in respect of such other matter or matters.

       section 1.07.  organization.  at each meeting of the stockholders the
chairman, or, if he shall be absent therefrom, the president, or if he shall be
absent therefrom, a vice chairman, or, if there shall not be any vice chairman
in office or if all the vice chairmen also shall be absent therefrom, a vice
president or another officer of the corporation chosen as chairman of such
meeting by a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person
or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, or, if all the officers of the
corporation shall be absent therefrom, a stockholder holding of record shares
of stock of the corporation so chosen, shall act as chairman of the meeting and
preside thereat; and the secretary, or, if he shall be absent from such meeting
or shall be required pursuant to the provisions of this section 1.07 to act as
chairman of such meeting, the person (who shall be an assistant secretary, if
an assistant secretary shall be present thereat) whom the chairman of such
meeting shall appoint shall act as secretary of such meeting and keep the
minutes thereof.

       section 1.08.  order of business.  the convening and adjournment of, and
the order of business at, each meeting of the stockholders shall be determined

       section 1.09.  voting.  except as otherwise provided in the second
restated certificate of incorporation of the corporation, as from time to time
amended, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy
for each share of stock of the corporation held by him and registered in his
name on the books of the corporation on the date fixed pursuant to the
provisions of section 6.05 hereof as the record date for the determination of
stockholders who shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting of
stockholders, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, as the case may be.  shares of its own stock belonging to the
corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to
vote in the election of directors of such other corporation shall be held by
the corporation, shall not be entitled to vote.  persons holding in a fiduciary
capacity stock of the corporation shall be entitled to vote such stock so held,
and persons whose stock shall be pledged shall be entitled to vote such stock,
unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the corporation he shall
have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the
pledgee, or his proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon.  if shares of
stock of the corporation shall stand of record in the names of two or more
persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants
in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons
shall have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares of stock
of the corporation, unless the secretary shall have been given written notice
to the contrary and have been furnished with a copy of the instrument or order
appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their
acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:

                (i)     if only one shall vote, his act shall bind all;

                (ii) if more than one shall vote, the act of the majority so
           voting shall bind all; and

                (iii) if more than one shall vote, but the vote shall be evenly
           split on any particular matter, then, except as otherwise required
           by the general corporation law of the state of delaware, each
           faction may vote the shares in question proportionally.

if the instrument so filed shall show that any such tenancy shall be held in
unequal interests, the majority or even-split for the purpose of the next
foregoing sentence shall be a majority or even-split in interest.  any vote on
stock of the corporation at any meeting of the stockholders by the stockholder
entitled thereto, and any expression of consent or dissent to corporate action
without a meeting by the stockholder entitled to express such consent or
dissent, may be given in person or by duly authorized proxy; provided, however,
that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date,
unless said proxy shall provide for a longer period.  without limiting the
manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act
for him as proxy under applicable law, the following shall constitute a valid
means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:  (i) a stockholder may
execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him as
proxy, which execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or his authorized
officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his

                                     - 4 -










<page> 24

signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but
not limited to, by facsimile signature; and (ii) a stockholder may authorize
another person or persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or
authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to
a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.  any copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission
created in accordance with the preceding sentence may be substituted or used in
lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which
the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.  at all meetings
of the stockholders all matters, except those specified in section 2.04 hereof,
and except also those the manner of deciding upon which shall be otherwise
expressly regulated by law or regulation, the rules and regulations of any
stock exchange applicable to the corporation or the second restated certificate
of incorporation of the corporation, as from time to time amended, shall be
decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of the stockholders
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, a quorum being
present.  except in the case of votes for the election of directors, unless
demanded by a stockholder of the corporation present in person or by proxy at
any meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by
the chairman of the meeting, the vote thereat on any other question need not be
by ballot.  upon a demand of any such stockholder for a vote by ballot on any
question or at the direction of such chairman that a vote by ballot be taken on
any question, such vote shall be taken.  on a vote by ballot each ballot shall
be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy, if there be such proxy,
and shall state the number of shares voted.

       section 1.10.  inspectors of election.  the corporation shall, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of
election, who may be employees of the corporation, to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.  the corporation may
designate one or more persons as alternative inspectors to replace any
inspector who fails to act.  in the event that no inspector so appointed or
designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at
the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and
sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his ability.  the inspector or
inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares
of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each
such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count
all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a
record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspectors and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of
capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such
inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.  such certification and report
shall specify


                                     - 5 -




<page> 25

such other information as may be required by law.  in determining the validity
and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law.  no person who is a candidate for an office at an election may
serve as an inspector at such election.

       section 1.11.  consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting.  (a) anything
in these by-laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any action required by the
general corporation law of the state of delaware to be, or which may be, taken
at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed in person or by
proxy by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and
if the procedures in this section 1.11 shall be complied with.

       (b) a record date for determining stockholders entitled to express
consent to stockholder action in writing without a meeting shall be fixed by
the board (a "consent record date"), which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the consent record date shall be adopted
by the board and which shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon
which such resolution shall have been adopted.  any person seeking to have the
stockholders authorize or take action by written consent without a meeting
shall give written notice either by personal delivery or by united states mail,
postage prepaid, to the secretary, of the intent of such person to have the
stockholders take action by written consent, which notice shall request the
board to fix a consent record date.  the board shall, within ten (10) days of
the receipt of such notice, fix as the consent record date a date which shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the consent record date
shall be adopted by the board and which shall not be more than ten (10) days
after the date upon which such resolution shall have been adopted.  if no
consent record date has been fixed by the board within ten (10) days of the
receipt of such notice, (i) the consent record date, when no prior action by
the board is required by applicable law for the corporate action to be taken by
written consent, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
corporation in the manner required by paragraph (c) of this section 1.11, and
(ii) the consent record date, when prior action by the board is required by
applicable law for the corporate action to be taken by written consent, shall
be at the close of business on the date on which the board adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

       (c) every written consent pursuant to this section 1.11 shall bear the
date of signature of each stockholder who shall sign such consent and no
written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date of the earliest dated
consent delivered to the corporation in the manner required by this section
1.11, written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take
action shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered
office in the state of delaware, its principal place of business or to an
officer or agent of the corporation

                                     - 6 -








<page> 26

having custody of the books in which meetings and proceedings of the
stockholders shall be recorded.  delivery made to said registered office of the
corporation shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested.

       (d) within three (3) business days after receipt of the earliest dated
consent delivered to the corporation in the manner provided in section 228(c)
of the general corporation law of the state of delaware or the determination by
the board that the corporation should seek corporate action by written consent,
as the case may be, the secretary shall appoint inspectors of elections for the
purpose of performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and
any revocations thereof.  the cost, if any, of retaining inspectors of election
shall be borne by the corporation.  consents and any revocations thereof shall
be delivered to the inspectors upon receipt by the corporation.  as soon as
such consents and revocations are received by the inspectors, the inspectors
shall review the consents and revocations and shall maintain a count of the
number of valid and unrevoked consents.  as soon as practicable after the
earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after the date of the earliest dated consent
delivered to the corporation in the manner provided in section 228(c) of the
general corporation law of the state of delaware or (ii) a written request
therefor by the corporation or the soliciting stockholders, if any (whichever
is soliciting consents), notice of which request shall be given to the party
opposing the solicitation of consents, if any, which request shall state that
the corporation or soliciting stockholders, as the case may be, have a good
faith belief that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents to
authorize or take the action specified in the consents has been received in
accordance with these by-laws, the inspectors shall issue a preliminary report
to the corporation and the soliciting stockholders stating:  (a) the number of
valid consents; (b) the number of valid revocations; (c) the number of valid
and unrevoked consents; (d) the number of invalid consents; (e) the number of
invalid revocations; and (f) whether, based on their preliminary count, the
requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents has been obtained to authorize
or take the action specified in the consents.  unless the corporation and the
soliciting stockholders, if any, shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the
corporation and the soliciting stockholders, if any, shall have forty-eight
(48) hours to review the consents and revocations and to advise the inspectors
and the opposing party, if any, in writing as to whether they intend to
challenge the preliminary report of the inspectors.  if no written notice of an
intention to challenge the preliminary report is received within forty-eight
(48) hours after the inspectors' issuance of the preliminary report, the
inspectors shall issue to the corporation and the soliciting stockholders, if
any, their final report containing the information from the inspectors'
determination with respect to whether the requisite number of valid and
unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize and take the action specified in
the consents.  if the corporation or the soliciting stockholders, if any, issue
written notice of an intention to challenge the inspectors' preliminary report
within forty-eight (48) hours after the issuance of that report, a challenge
session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable.  a
transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court
reporter.  following completion of the challenge session, the inspectors shall
as promptly as practicable issue their final report to the soliciting
stockholders, if any, and the corporation, which report shall contain the
information included in the preliminary report, plus all changes in the vote
totals as a result of the challenge and a certification of whether

                                     - 7 -




<page> 27

the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize
or take the action specified in the consents.  a copy of the final report of
the inspectors shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded.  no action taken by written consent
shall be deemed effective until said final report is issued.

       (e) prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who shall not have consented in writing and who, if the action had
been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if
the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed
by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
corporation as provided in paragraph (c) of this section 1.11.

minutes of proceedings of the board.

       section 2.13.  removal of directors.  subject to the rights of the
holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common

record of the corporation holding of record a majority in voting interest of
the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; and the vacancy
in the board caused by any such removal may be filled as provided in section
2.07 hereof.  in the case of the removal of a director for cause, "cause" is
hereby defined as the willful and continuous failure substantially to perform
one's duties to the corporation or the willful engaging in gross misconduct
materially and demonstrably injurious to the corporation.

       section 2.14.  compensation.  unless otherwise expressly provided by
resolution adopted by the board, neither any of the directors nor any of the
members of any committee of the corporation contemplated by these by-laws or
otherwise provided for by resolution of the board shall, as such, receive any
stated compensation for his services; but the board may at any time or from
time to time by resolution provide that a specified sum shall be paid to any
director of the corporation or to any member of any such committee either as
his annual compensation as such director or member or as compensation for his
attendance at meetings of the board or of such committee.  the board may also
likewise provide that the corporation shall reimburse each such director or
member of such committee for any expenses paid by him on account of his
attendance at any such meeting.  nothing in this section 2.14 contained shall
be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other
capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

board; and it shall have power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be

       section 3.02.  organization, etc.  the chairman or, if he shall be
absent therefrom, the president shall act as chairman at all meetings of the
executive committee and the secretary shall act as secretary thereof.  in case
of the absence from any meeting of the committee of the chairman, the
president, or the secretary, the committee may appoint a chairman or secretary,
as the case may be, of the meeting.

       section 3.03.  meetings.  regular meetings of the executive committee,
of which notice shall not be necessary, shall be held on such days and at such
places, within or without the state of delaware, as shall be fixed by
resolution adopted by a majority of the committee and communicated to all its
members.  special meetings of the committee shall be held whenever called by
the chairman, the president, the secretary or a majority of the members of such
committee then in office.  notice of each special meeting of the committee
shall be given by mail, telegraph, cable, wireless, telex, telefax, electronic
or other form of recorded communication or be delivered personally or by
telephone to each member of the committee not later than the day before the day
on which such meeting is to be held.  notice of any such meeting need not,
however, be given to any member of the committee who shall attend such meeting
except a member of the committee who shall attend such meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business on the grounds that the meeting shall not have been lawfully

expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates
shall be presented to the corporation for transfer, both the transferor and the
transferee shall in writing request the corporation to do so.

       section 6.03.  regulations.  the board may make such rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these by-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for stock of
the corporation.  the board may appoint, or authorize any officer or officers
to appoint, one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may
require all certificates for stock to bear the signature or signatures of any
of them.

       section 6.04.  lost, stolen, destroyed and mutilated certificates.  the
registered owner of any stock of the corporation shall immediately notify the
corporation of any loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of the certificate
therefor, and the corporation may issue a new certificate for stock in the

lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may, in its discretion, require
the registered owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or his legal
representatives to give the corporation a bond in such sum, limited or
unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties, as the
corporation shall in its uncontrolled discretion determine, to indemnify the
corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate, or the issuance of
such new certificate.  the corporation may, however, in its discretion refuse
to issue any such new certificate except pursuant to legal proceedings under

shall be adopted by the board, and which record date shall not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (l0) days before the date of such meeting.  if no
record date shall be fixed by the board the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders

notice shall be given, or, if notice shall be waived, at the close of business
on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  a

meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the board may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

       (b) in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date shall be
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to
such action.  if no record date shall be fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto.

       section 8.01.  dividends, surplus, etc.  subject to the provisions of
law, of the second restated certificate of incorporation of the corporation, as
from time to time amended, and of these by-laws, the board may declare and pay
dividends upon the shares of the stock of the corporation either (a) out of its
surplus as defined in and computed in accordance with the provisions of the
laws of the state of delaware or (b), in case it shall not have any such
surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend shall
be declared and/or the preceding fiscal year, whenever and in such amounts as,
in the opinion of the board, the condition of the affairs of the corporation
shall render it advisable.  the board in its discretion may use and apply any
of such surplus or such net profits in purchasing or acquiring any of the
shares of the stock of the corporation in accordance with law, or any of its
bonds, debentures, notes, scrip or other securities or evidences of
indebtedness, or from time to time may set aside from such surplus or such net
profits such sum or sums as it, in its absolute discretion, may think proper,

the purpose of maintaining or increasing the property or business of the
corporation, or for any other purpose it may think conducive to the best
interests of the corporation; provided, however, that, except as otherwise
permitted by law, the corporation shall not use its funds or property for the
purchase of shares of its stock when the capital of the corporation shall be
impaired or when such use would cause any impairment of its capital.  all such
surplus or such net profits, until actually declared in dividends, or used and
applied as aforesaid, shall be deemed to have been so set aside by the board
for one or more of said purposes.

                                  article ix.

                    indemnification of directors, officers,
                             employees and agents.

       section 9.01.  third party actions.  (a) the corporation, to the full
extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the state of
delaware, as such laws may be amended from time to time, shall indemnify any
person who shall have been or shall be made a party to or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding
(including any appeal thereof), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation), by
reason of the fact that such person shall have been or shall be a director or
officer of the corporation, or, if at a time when he shall have been or shall
be a director or officer of the corporation, shall have been or shall be
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent (a "subsidiary officer") of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise (an "affiliated entity"), against expenses (including attorneys'
fees), costs, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding if such person shall have acted in good faith and in a
manner such person shall have reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interest of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, shall have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the corporation shall
have consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person shall not
have acted in good faith and in a manner which such person shall have
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such
person shall have had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful.  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions
of this paragraph (a), a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to
indemnification pursuant to this paragraph (a) against any expenses (including
attorneys' fees), costs, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced
by such person against the corporation or any person who shall have been or
shall be a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the corporation
or a subsidiary officer of an affiliated entity, but such indemnification may
be provided by the corporation in any specific case as permitted by section
9.06 hereof.

       (b) the corporation may indemnify any employee or agent of the
corporation in the manner and to the extent that it shall indemnify any
director or officer under this section 9.01, including indemnity in respect of
service at the request of the corporation as a subsidiary officer of an
affiliated entity.

       section 9.02.  derivative actions.  (a) the corporation, to the full
extent permitted, and in the manner required, by the laws of the state of
delaware, as such laws may be amended from time to time, shall indemnify any
person who shall have been or shall be made a party to or shall be threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit
(including any appeal thereof) brought in the right of the corporation to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person shall
have been or shall be a director or officer of the corporation, or, if at a
time when he shall have been or shall be a director or officer of the
corporation shall have been or shall be serving at the request of the
corporation as a subsidiary officer of an affiliated entity against expenses
(including attorneys' fees) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action or suit if such person shall have acted
in good faith and in a manner such person shall have reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
unless, and except to the extent that, the court of chancery of the state of
delaware or the court in which such judgment shall have been rendered shall
determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person shall be fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the court of
chancery of the state of delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph (a), a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to
indemnification pursuant to this paragraph (a) against costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action or suit in
the right of the corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification
may be provided by the corporation in any specific case as permitted by section
9.06 hereof.

       (b) the corporation may indemnify any employee or agent of the
corporation in the manner and to the extent that it shall indemnify any
director or officer under this section 9.02, including indemnity in respect of
service at the request of the corporation as a subsidiary officer of an
affiliated entity.

       section 9.03.  determination of entitlement to indemnification.  any
indemnification under section 9.01 or section 9.02 hereof (unless ordered by a
court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director,
officer, employee or agent is proper under the circumstances because such
person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in section 9.01 or
section 9.02 hereof.  such determination shall be made with respect to a person
who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such
directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than
a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so
direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the
stockholders.  in the event a request for indemnification shall be made by any
person referred to in paragraph (a) of section 9.01 hereof or paragraph (a) of
section 9.02 hereof, the corporation shall cause such determination to be made
not later than sixty (60) days after such request shall be made.

       section 9.04.  right to indemnification upon successful defense and for
service as a witness.  (a) notwithstanding the other provisions of this article
ix, to the extent that a present or former director or officer of the
corporation shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of
any action, suit or proceeding referred to in section 9.01 or section 9.02
hereof or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

       (b) to the extent any person who shall have been or shall be a director
or officer of the corporation shall have served or prepared to serve as a
witness in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, or in any investigation by the corporation or
the board thereof or a committee thereof or by any securities exchange on which
securities of the corporation shall have been or shall be listed or by any
national securities association, by reason of his services as a director or
officer of the corporation or, if at a time when he shall have been a director
or officer of the corporation, by reason of his services at the request of the
corporation as a subsidiary officer of an affiliated entity, the corporation
shall indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) and
costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith
within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the corporation from such person
of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and
reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs.  the corporation may indemnify
any employee or agent of the corporation to the same extent it is required to
indemnify any director or officer of the corporation pursuant to the foregoing
sentence of this paragraph (b).  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b), a person shall not be entitled,
as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this paragraph (b) against
costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
commenced by such person against the corporation or any person who shall have
been or shall be a director, officer, fiduciary, employee or agent of the
corporation or a subsidiary officer of an affiliated entity, but such
indemnification may be provided by the corporation in any specific case as
permitted by section 9.06 hereof.

       section 9.05.  advance of expenses.  (a) expenses (including attorneys'
fees) and costs incurred by any person referred to in paragraph (a) of section
9.01 hereof or paragraph (a) of section 9.02 hereof in defending a civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
person shall not be entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized
by this article ix.

       (b) expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs incurred by any
person referred to in paragraph (b) of section 9.01 hereof or paragraph (b) of
section 9.02 hereof in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or

proceeding as authorized by the board, a committee thereof or an officer of the

indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and costs to any person under
this article ix, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or
advancement of expenses and costs under this article ix, shall not limit or
restrict in any way the power of the corporation to indemnify or advance
expenses (including attorneys' fees) and costs to such person in any other way
permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of any right to which any person
seeking indemnification or advancement of such expenses and costs may be
entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to any action relating to such person in the
capacity of an officer, director, employee or agent of the corporation and any
action relating to him in any other capacity while holding any such position.

       section 9.07.  accrual of claims; successors.  the indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided for or permitted under this article ix shall
apply in respect of any expenses (including attorneys' fees), costs, judgments,
fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement, whether or not the claim or
cause of action in respect thereof accrued or arose before or after the
effective date of this article ix.  the right of any person who shall have been
or shall be a director or officer of the corporation to indemnification and
advancement of expenses under this article ix shall continue after he shall
have ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, distributees, executors, administrators and other legal representatives
of such person.

       section 9.08.  corporate obligations; reliance.  this article ix shall
be deemed to create a binding obligation on the part of the corporation to its
current and former officers and directors and their heirs, distributees,
executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and each director or
officer in acting in such capacity shall be entitled to rely on the provisions
of this article ix, without giving notice thereof to the corporation.

       section 9.09.  insurance.  the corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who shall have been or shall be a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or shall have been or shall be
serving at the request of the corporation as a subsidiary officer of any

incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have had the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
article ix or applicable law.
