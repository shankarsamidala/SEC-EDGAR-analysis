                       management's discussion and analysis of
                    results of operations and financial condition

overview
at&amp;t; corporation (at&amp;t;) is among the world's communications  leaders,  providing
voice, data and video telecommunications services to large and small businesses,
consumers and government  agencies.  we provide domestic and international  long
distance, regional, local and wireless communications services, cable television
and internet communications services. we also provide directory and calling-card
services to support our communications business.

on june 15, 2000, at&amp;t; completed a merger with mediaone group,  inc.  (mediaone)
in a cash and stock transaction  valued at approximately  $56 billion.  for each
share of mediaone stock, mediaone shareholders received, in the aggregate,  0.95
of a share of at&amp;t;  common  stock and  $36.27 per share in cash,  consisting  of
$30.85 per share as stipulated in the merger agreement and $5.42 per share based
on at&amp;t;'s  stock price  preceding  the merger,  which was below a  predetermined
amount.  at&amp;t; issued  approximately 603 million shares of common stock, of which
approximately  60 million were  treasury  shares.  the merger with  mediaone was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, accordingly the operating
results  of  mediaone  have  been  included  in  the  accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements  since the date of  acquisition  as part of our  broadband
segment.

on april  27,  2000,  at&amp;t;  created a new class of stock  when we  completed  an
initial  public  offering of 360 million  shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock.  this  stock is  designed  to track the  economic  performance  of at&amp;t;'s
wireless  services  business and  represented a 15.6% interest in that business.
at&amp;t;  retained the  remaining  84.4%  interest in the at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  in
connection  with our first quarter 1999 merger with  tele-communications,  inc.,
(tci) renamed at&amp;t; broadband (broadband), we issued a separate tracking stock to
reflect the  economic  performance  of liberty  media group  (lmg),  broadband's
former programming and technology investment businesses. all other businesses of
at&amp;t; comprise at&amp;t; common stock group,  including at&amp;t;'s retained 84.4% interest
in at&amp;t; wireless group, the economic performance of which is represented by at&amp;t;
common stock.

the consolidated  results of at&amp;t; include at&amp;t; wireless group in its entirety on
a fully consolidated  basis. we do not have a controlling  financial interest in
liberty media group for financial accounting purposes;  therefore, our ownership
in lmg is reflected as an  investment  accounted  for under the equity method in
at&amp;t;'s consolidated financial statements.

the earnings attributable to at&amp;t; wireless group represent 15.6% of the earnings
for the third  quarter,  and 15.6% of the earnings from april 27, 2000, the date
of the initial public offering, through september 30, 2000, for the year-to-date
period. the remaining earnings of at&amp;t;'s wireless services business are included
in the earnings attributable to at&amp;t; common stock group. similarly, the earnings
or losses related to lmg are excluded from the earnings available to at&amp;t; common
stock group.

ownership of shares of at&amp;t; common stock,  at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock or
liberty media group tracking stock does not represent a direct legal interest in
the assets and  liabilities of any of these groups,  but an ownership of at&amp;t; in
total. each of these shares  represents an interest in the economic  performance
of each of these groups.

on january 5, 2000,  at&amp;t; and  british  telecommunications,  plc (bt)  announced
financial closure of concert,  their global  communications joint venture.  at&amp;t;
contributed all of its international  gateway-to-gateway assets and the economic
value of approximately 270 multinational  customers. in addition, we contributed
our international settlement business (revenue and expenses) to concert. results
for 2000 reflect the impact of these contributions.

the  discussion  and  analysis  that  follows  provides  information  management
believes is relevant to an assessment and  understanding of at&amp;t;'s  consolidated
results  of  operations  and cash  flows  for the three  and nine  months  ended
september 30, 2000 and 1999,  and financial  condition as of september 30, 2000,
and december 31, 1999.

revenue increased $642 million in the third quarter of 2000, or 3.9%, to $16,975
million compared with the third quarter of 1999, and increased $2,895 million in
the first nine months of 2000,  or 6.3%,  to $49,097  million  compared with the

the increase was led by wireless  services,  broadband,  and business  services,
partially offset by a decline in consumer services. for the first nine months of
2000  normalized  revenue,  which also adjusts for the  acquisition of tci, rose
$2,261 million,  or 4.7%, from $48,234 million in the first nine months of 1999.

dollars in millions
access and other connection          $3,255    $3,654    $10,460    $11,054

access and other connection  expenses decreased 10.9%, to $3,255 million for the
three  months  ended  september  30,  2000.  included  within  access  and other
connection  expenses  are costs  that we pay to  connect  domestic  calls on the
facilities of other service  providers.  these costs decreased  primarily due to
mandated  reductions in per-minute  access costs and decreased  per-line charges
(primary  interexchange  carrier  charges).  effective  july 1,  2000,  per-line
charges  at&amp;t; pays for  residential  and  single-line  business  customers  were
eliminated by the fcc. these decreases were partially offset by volume increases
and higher universal service fund contributions.

also  included  within  access and other  connection  expenses are costs paid to
foreign  telephone   companies  to  connect  calls  made  to  foreign  countries
(international  settlements).  as result of the  commencement  of  operations of
concert,  most of our  international  settlements  are  incurred by concert.  in
addition,  most of our  foreign  billed  revenue is now earned by  concert.  the
amount charged by concert in 2000 is lower than interconnection expense incurred
in 1999, since at&amp;t; recorded these transactions  within revenue and expense,  as
applicable. concert bills us a net expense comprised of international settlement
(interconnection)  expense and foreign billed revenue.  partially offsetting the
decline were costs incurred  related to concert  products that at&amp;t; now sells to
its customers.

access and other connection  expenses decreased 5.4%, to $10,460 million for the
nine months ended september 30, 2000. the decrease was primarily attributable to
lower  net  interconnection  expense  largely  related  to the  commencement  of
operations of concert.

also contributing to the decrease were mandated  reductions in per-minute access
costs as well as the sale of acc international, more efficient network usage and
reduced primary  interexchange carrier charges resulting from the elimination of
certain per-line charges by the fcc effective july 1, 2000. these decreases were
partially  offset  by  volume  increases  and  higher  universal   service  fund
contributions.

the  acquisitions  of mediaone  and agns,  the  formation  of  concert,  certain
international  divestments  and  the  consolidation  of  excite@home,  costs  of
services and  products  increased  approximately  8% in the third  quarter.  the
increase was primarily due to higher  equipment costs associated with the growth
of  the  wireless  subscriber  base,   increased  costs  to  support  growth  in
outsourcing  contracts and increased broadband  programming expenses due to rate
increases.  these  increases  were  partially  offset by continued  cost control
efforts  and a higher  pension  credit  in 2000,  primarily  driven  by a higher
pension trust asset base resulting from increased investment returns.

costs of services and products  increased 18.0%, to $12,578 million in the first
nine months of 2000 compared with the same period in 1999.  excluding the impact
of the acquisitions of tci, mediaone and agns, the formation of concert, certain
international  divestments  and  the  consolidation  of  excite@home,  costs  of
services and products  increased  approximately  8%. this increase was primarily
due to higher costs  associated  with our growing  wireless  subscriber base and
wireless network, increased costs to support growth in outsourcing contracts and
higher  video  programming  costs  principally  due  to  rate  increases.  these
increases were  partially  offset by continued  cost control  efforts,  a higher
pension credit and a lower provision for uncollectible  receivables primarily in
consumer services.

with the same periods of 1999.  excluding the impact of the acquisitions of tci,
mediaone and agns, the formation of concert,  certain international  divestments
and the consolidation of excite@home, sg&amp;a; expenses declined approximately 6% in
both periods.  the decrease was primarily the result of cost control  efforts as
well as a larger  pension  credit  in  2000.  these  were  partially  offset  by
increased  customer  acquisition and customer care expenses  associated with our
growth businesses of wireless and broadband.

depreciation  and  other  amortization  expenses  increased  23.2% in the  third
quarter of 2000 and  increased  17.5% in the first nine months of 2000  compared
with the same periods in 1999.  excluding the impact of the acquisitions of tci,
mediaone and agns, the formation of concert,  certain international  divestments
and the  consolidation  of  excite@home,  depreciation  and  other  amortization
expenses increased  approximately 12% in the third quarter of 2000 and increased
approximately  11% in the  first  nine  months  of 2000.  these  increases  were
primarily due to a higher asset base  resulting  from  continued  infrastructure
investment.  capital  expenditures  were $3.6  billion  for the  third  quarter,
bringing  year-to-date  capital  expenditures  to $10.1 billion.  we continue to
focus the majority of our capital spending on our growth businesses of wireless,
broadband, data and internet protocol (ip) and local voice.

amortization  of goodwill,  franchise  costs,  and other  purchased  intangibles
increased  $521  million to $879 million in the third  quarter of 2000  compared
with the third quarter of 1999. the increase was primarily  attributable  to the
consolidation of excite@home beginning september 1, 2000, and the acquisition of
mediaone in 2000.  in the first nine months of 2000,  amortization  of goodwill,
franchise costs and other purchased intangibles increased $761 million to $1,661
million  compared  with the  first  nine  months of 1999,  primarily  due to the
acquisition of mediaone in 2000, the  acquisitions  of tci and agns in 1999, and
the consolidation of excite@home in 2000.

at&amp;t;  also  has  amortization  of  goodwill   associated  with   nonconsolidated
investments  recorded as a reduction of other income.  this totaled $238 million
and $164  million in the third  quarter  of 2000,  and 1999,  respectively,  and
totaled  $471  million  and $356  million  for the first nine months of 2000 and

net restructuring and other charges     $24       $ -       $797      $702

during the third quarter of 2000, at&amp;t; recorded $24 million of net restructuring
and other charges, which had a minimal impact on diluted earnings per share. the
charge  resulted from synergies  associated with the mediaone merger and related
to cash termination benefits associated with the involuntary separation of about
490  employees.  approximately  one-half  of  the  individuals  were  management
employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.

this  restructuring  initiative  is  projected  to  yield a net cash  payout  of
approximately  $18 million in 2000, with  approximately  $27 million per year in
cash savings per year thereafter,  as well as earnings before interest and taxes
(ebit) savings of approximately $6 million in 2000 and approximately $27 million
per year thereafter. we expect that increased spending in growth businesses will
largely  offset  these  cash  and ebit  savings.  the  ebit  savings,  primarily
attributable  to reduced  personnel-related  expenses,  will be realized in sg&amp;a;
expenses and costs of services and products.

net  restructuring  and other  charges for the nine months ended  september  30,
2000,  totaled $797 million,  which had an approximate  $0.14 impact on earnings
per diluted  share.  the charge  included  restructuring  and exit costs of $706
million and a $91 million  charge  related to the mandated  disposition  of at&amp;t;
communications (u.k.) ltd. (comms u.k.), which would have competed directly with
concert.  the  restructuring and exit costs related to actions across several of
our business  units and included  severance  costs  associated  with about 6,700
employees.  these actions were  primarily  driven by our  continuing  efforts to
streamline operations and reduce costs by $2 billion by the end of the year.

the charge for the nine months  ended  september  30,  2000,  also  included $62
million of network lease and other contract  termination  costs  associated with
penalties  incurred as part of  notifying  vendors of the  termination  of these
contracts  during the first quarter of 2000.  additionally,  the charge included
$144 million of benefit  curtailment costs associated with employee  separations
as part of these exit plans.  we also recorded an $18 million  asset  impairment
charge related to the write-down of unrecoverable  assets in certain  businesses
in which the carrying value is no longer supported by future cash flows.

net  restructuring  and other  charges for the nine months ended  september  30,
1999,  totaled $702 million,  which had an approximate  $0.21 impact on earnings
per  diluted  share.  the  charge  included  a pretax  in-process  research  and
development  charge  of $594  million  related  to the tci  acquisition,  a $128
million  pretax net charge  primarily  related  to the exit from  certain  joint
ventures that would have competed directly with concert and a $50 million pretax
charge related to a contribution  agreement entered into by broadband to satisfy
certain liabilities of phoenixstar,  inc. these charges were partially offset by
a $70 million pretax gain related to the settlement of pension  obligations  for
former  employees who accepted at&amp;t;'s  voluntary  retirement  incentive  program
offer.

the $594  million  in-process  research and  development  charge  reflected  the
estimated fair value of research and development projects at tci, as of the date
of the acquisition,  which had not yet reached technological feasibility or that
had no  alternative  future  use.  although  there are  technological  issues to
overcome  to  successfully   complete  the  acquired   in-process  research  and
development,  we believe we are on track for successful completion. the projects
identified  related to  efforts to offer  voice  over  internet  protocol  (ip),
product-integration  efforts for advanced set-top devices,  cost-savings efforts
for cable  telephony  implementation  and  in-process  research and  development
related  to  excite@home.  we expect to test ip  telephony  equipment  for field
deployment and begin field trials related to our product integration efforts for
set-top devices late in the fourth quarter into early 2001.  in addition, trials
related to our telephony  cost  reductions are complete and  implementation  has
begun in certain markets.

operating income                     $2,954    $3,389     $8,623    $8,418

operating income decreased 12.9% in the third quarter of 2000 primarily due to a
decline in consumer  services  revenue,  the  acquisition  of  mediaone  and the
consolidation of excite@home.  these decreases were partially offset by a higher
pension credit in 2000 and cost control efforts within business services.

operating income increased 2.4% for the first nine months of 2000, primarily due
to operational  efficiencies  within business  services and wireless services as
well as corporate  staff  functions,  and a higher  pension  credit in 2000. the
year-to-date  increase was partially  offset by the  acquisition of mediaone,  a
decline in consumer  services  revenue,  the  consolidation of excite@home,  the
acquisition of tci and higher  restructuring  charges.  operating  income margin
(operating  income as a percent of revenue) was 17.4% for the third  quarter and
17.6% for the nine months  ended  september  30, 2000,  compared  with 20.8% and
18.2% in the comparable 1999 periods, respectively.

other income  (expense)  increased  $446 million to income of $71 million in the
third  quarter of 2000,  compared  with an expense of $375  million in the third
quarter of 1999.  the increase was  primarily  attributable  to higher  minority
interest  and  lower  equity   losses  on   investments   associated   with  the
consolidation of excite@home  effective  september 1, 2000. also contributing to
the increase was higher  interest and dividend income and greater gains on sales
of businesses and investments.

other income (expense)  increased $740 million to income of $486 million for the
nine months ended  september 30, 2000,  compared with an expense of $254 million
for the same prior year  period.  the  increase was  primarily  attributable  to
greater gains on sales of businesses  and  investments  and higher  interest and
dividend income.  further contributing to the increase were equity earnings from
concert.  these  increases  were  partially  offset by  higher  losses on equity
investments, primarily from excite@home through august 31, 2000.

ebit,  excluding lmg,  remained  essentially  flat for the third quarter of 2000
compared with the third quarter of 1999, with the increase in other income being
virtually offset by the decrease in operating income.  for the first nine months
of 2000,  ebit grew  11.6%  compared  with the same  period  in 1999,  which was
attributable  to increases in both other income and operating  income.  the ebit
growth  was  impacted  by  gains on sales of  businesses  and  investments,  our
ownership interests in cablevision  systems corp.  (cablevision) and time warner
entertainment  (twe) and net  restructuring  and other charges.  excluding these
items,  ebit  increased  6.8% and 11.3% for the third  quarter and  year-to-date
periods,  respectively.  the  improvement  for the third  quarter was  primarily
attributable  to  increased  other  income  partially  offset by a  decrease  in
operating income. the improvement for the year-to-date  period was primarily due
to both higher other income and operating income.

equity  earnings  from  liberty  media  group were  $1,756  million in the third
quarter of 2000,  compared  with  losses of $217  million in the same prior year
quarter.  the  increase  was  primarily  due  to  a  gain  associated  with  the
acquisition  of tv guide by  gemstar - tv guide  international,  inc.  (gemstar)
reflecting the difference between the carrying value of lmg's interest in tv

the  acquisition.  equity  earnings from lmg for the nine months ended september
30, 2000,  were $2,965 million  compared with losses of $818 million in 1999. in
addition to the gain associated with the tv guide  acquisition,  the increase in
equity  earnings for the nine months ended september 30, 2000, was also impacted
by a gain  associated  with the  acquisition  of flextech  p.l.c.  (flextech) by
telewest   communications   plc  (telewest)  and  a  gain  associated  with  the
acquisition of general instrument  corporation (general instrument) by motorola,
inc. (motorola).  these gains also represent the difference between the carrying
value of lmg's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of securities
received in the merger.  these gains were partially offset by impairment charges
recorded on liberty  media's  investments in teligent,  inc.  (teligent) and icg
communications, inc. (icg) to reflect other than temporary declines in value.

interest  expense  increased  92.2% to $946 million in the third quarter of 2000
compared with the third quarter of 1999,  primarily due to a higher average debt
balance as a result of our june 15, 2000,  acquisition  of  mediaone,  including
outstanding debt of mediaone and debt issued to fund the mediaone acquisition.

interest  expense  increased  81.6% to $2,158  million for the nine months ended

provision for income taxes             $763      $888     $2,127    $2,679

the provision for income taxes decreased $125 million, or 14.2%, to $763 million
in the third  quarter  of 2000  compared  with the third  quarter  of 1999.  the
decrease was primarily due to lower earnings before taxes, partially offset by a
slightly higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate for the third quarter
of 2000 was 36.7%,  up from 35.2% in the third quarter of 1999. the increase was
due to impact of the consolidation of excite@home, which is unable to record tax
benefits on its pretax losses, as well as the positive impact of certain foreign
legal entity restructurings in 1999.

the  provision  for income taxes for the nine months ended  september  30, 2000,
decreased $552 million  compared with the same period in 1999. the effective tax
rate for the nine months ended  september 30, 2000,  was 30.6%,  down from 38.4%
for the same prior year period.  in 2000,  the effective tax rate was positively
impacted  by a tax-free  gain  resulting  from an  exchange of at&amp;t; stock for an
entity owning  certain  cable  systems and other assets with cox  communications
inc.  (cox),  and the  benefit of the  write-off  of the  related  deferred  tax
liability.  the 1999  effective  rate was  negatively  impacted by an in-process
research and development  charge which was not tax deductible,  which was offset
by the positive

impacts of the cox transaction,  the in-process research and development charge,

as reported,  diluted earning per share (eps)  attributable to at&amp;t; common stock
group decreased  30.0% to $0.35 in the third quarter of 2000,  compared with the
third quarter of 1999. the decrease was primarily  driven by the  acquisition of
mediaone, including the impact of shares issued, additional interest expense and
operating  losses  generated by mediaone  largely  attributable  to depreciation
expense and  amortization  of  franchise  costs,  goodwill  and other  purchased
intangibles.  the decrease was  partially  offset by an increase in other income
primarily associated with higher interest and dividend income and gains on sales
of businesses and investments.

as reported,  diluted eps attributable to at&amp;t; common stock group increased 0.7%
to $1.40 in the nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  compared  with the nine
months ended  september 30, 1999. the increase was primarily due to higher other
income,  and  improved  operating  income in the period  resulting  from  margin
improvements.  these  improvements  were partially  offset by the acquisition of
mediaone, including the impact of shares issued, additional interest expense and
operating  losses  generated by mediaone  largely  attributable  to depreciation
expense and  amortization  of  franchise  costs,  goodwill  and other  purchased
intangibles.

included in eps for the third quarter are the following items:
 ..losses of $0.03 in the third quarter of 2000 and $0.02 in the third quarter of
  1999,  reflecting   the  earnings  impact  of  our  investments   in  twe  and
  cablevision;
 ..gain on sale of a business of $0.02 in the third quarter of 1999.

included  in eps for the first  nine  months of 2000 and 1999 are the  following
items:
 ..net  restructuring and other charges of $0.14 in the first nine months of 2000
  and $0.21 in the same period of 1999;
 ..losses of $0.05 in the first nine months of 2000 and $0.05 in  the same period
  of 1999,  reflecting the earnings impact of our investments in cablevision and
  twe;
 ..net gains on sales of  businesses  and  investments  and other of $0.21 in the
  first nine months of 2000 and $0.07 in the same period of 1999;
 ..a $0.02  benefit  in the first nine  months of 1999 from  changes in tax rules
  with respect to the utilization of acquired net operating losses.

the total  impact of these  items to diluted eps was a decrease of $0.03 for the
three months  ended  september  30, 2000,  and an increase of $0.02 for the nine
months ended  september  30, 2000.  these items had no net impact to diluted eps
for the third  quarter of 1999 and  decreased  diluted eps by $0.17 for the nine
months ended  september  30, 1999.  we quantify the impact on our results of our
investments  in  cablevision  and twe  since  these  businesses  have  financial
information  publicly available and their results can be reviewed  independently
of at&amp;t;'s results.

eps  excluding  these items was $0.38 per diluted  share in the third quarter of
2000, a decrease of 24.0%, or $0.12, over the comparable prior year quarter. eps
excluding  these  items was $1.38 per diluted  share for the nine  months  ended
september 30, 2000,  compared with $1.56 for the same period in 1999, a decrease
of 11.5%.

eps for  liberty  media  group was $0.68  per share for the three  months  ended
september 30, 2000, compared with a loss of $0.09 per share for the three months
ended  september 30, 1999. the increase in eps for the third quarter of 2000, is
primarily due to a gain  associated  with the acquisition of tv guide by gemstar
reflecting  the  difference  between the carrying  value of lmg's interest in tv
guide and the fair value of the gemstar securities  received in the acquisition.
eps for  liberty  media  group was $1.15 per share for the first nine  months of
2000,  compared with a loss of $0.33 per share in 1999. the first nine months of
2000 results  include nine months of liberty media group  results  compared with
seven months in 1999,  reflecting the march 1999  acquisition of tci by at&amp;t.; in
addition to the gain associated with the tv guide  acquisition,  the increase in
eps for the nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  was also impacted by a gain
associated  with the  acquisition of flextech by telewest and a gain  associated
with the  acquisition  of  general  instrument  by  motorola.  these  gains also
represent the  difference  between the carrying  value of lmg's  interest in the
acquired company and the fair value of securities received in the mergers. these
gains were partially  offset by impairment  charges  recorded on liberty media's
investments  in teligent  and icg to reflect  other than  temporary  declines in
value.

segment results

in support of the  services we provide,  we segment our results by the  business
units that support our primary lines of business:  business  services,  consumer
services,  wireless  services and  broadband.  a fifth  category,  corporate and
other,  includes  corporate staff  functions,  the elimination of  inter-segment
business as well as the results of  international  operations  and  ventures and
excite@home. although not a segment, we also discuss the results of lmg.

the discussion of segment results includes  revenue;  earnings,  including other
income,  before  interest and taxes (ebit);  earnings,  including  other income,
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and  amortization,  and minority interest
(ebitda);  total assets;  and capital  additions.  the  discussion of ebitda for
wireless  services and broadband is modified to exclude other income  (expense).
total assets for each segment generally  exclude  intercompany  assets.  prepaid
pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally held at
the corporate level and therefore are included in the corporate and other group.
shared  network  assets are  allocated  to the  segments  and  reallocated  each
january,  based on two years of  volumes.  capital  additions  for each  segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,  acquisitions of
licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
and additions to internal-use software.

ebit is the primary  measure used by at&amp;t;'s chief  operating  decision makers to
measure  at&amp;t;'s  operating  results  and to measure  segment  profitability  and
performance.  at&amp;t;  calculates  ebit as operating  income plus other income.  in
addition,  management also uses ebitda as a measure of segment profitability and
performance,  and is  defined as ebit plus  depreciation  and  amortization  and
minority  interest.  interest and taxes are not factored into the  profitability
measure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for these
items  are  discussed  on a  consolidated  basis.  management  believes  ebit is
meaningful to investors  because it is used by at&amp;t;'s chief  operating  decision
makers  and  provides a measure  of return on total  capitalization.  we believe
ebitda is meaningful to investors as a measure of each  segment's  liquidity and
is utilized by our chief operating decision makers. in addition, we believe that
both ebit and ebitda allow  investors a means to evaluate the financial  results
of each segment in relation to at&amp;t.;  our  calculation of ebit and ebitda may or
may not be consistent  with the  calculation  of these  measures by other public
companies.  ebit and ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (gaap)  measures of income as a
measure of performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing
activities  as a measure of  liquidity.  in addition,  ebitda does not take into
account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flow.

our existing segments reflect certain  managerial  changes since the publication
of our 1999 annual  results.  all prior  period  results  have been  restated to
reflect these changes.

to provide comparability,  we normalize revenue to reflect the impact of certain
1999 and 2000  transactions.  for  example,  when we normalize  for concert,  we
remove the revenue associated with  businesses/customers  contributed to concert
from 1999  results.  the  acquisitions  of tci,  agns and  mediaone  and certain
international  divestments are normalized as if those  acquisitions/dispositions
occurred on january 1, 1999. the  elimination of per-line  charges by the fcc is
normalized  in 1999  results  as if the  elimination  occurred  on july 1, 1999.
finally, certain 2000 broadband cable swaps are normalized in 1999 results as if
those swaps happened on the corresponding date in 1999.

business services
our business services segment offers a variety of global communications services
including long distance, local and data and internet protocol (ip) networking to
small and medium-sized  businesses,  large domestic and multinational businesses
and government agencies. business services is also a provider of voice, data and
ip transport to service resellers  (wholesale  services).  also included in this
segment is at&amp;t;  solutions,  which is composed of the solutions  outsourcing and
network  management  business unit and the internal at&amp;t; information  technology
services unit.

revenue
business services revenue  increased $52 million,  or 0.7%, in the third quarter
of 2000,  and increased  $1,123  million,  or 5.5%, for the first nine months of
2000,  compared with the prior year.  normalized for the impact of concert,  the
1999  acquisition of agns and the elimination of picc for  single-line  business
customers  by the fcc,  revenue  increased  2.5% and  4.1% for the  quarter  and
year-to-date  periods,  respectively.  the  increases  were driven  primarily by
strength in data/ip and outsourcing  services,  partially offset by a decline in
long distance voice services.

normalized data/ip services revenue grew over 20% for the quarter, led by growth
in frame relay,  high-speed  private line and ip services.  for the year-to-date
period,  normalized  data/ip  services  revenue grew at a high-teens rate led by
growth in frame relay,  ip and high-speed  private line  services.  ip services,
which include at&amp;t; worldnet services and virtual private network services (vpn),
grew over 50% for both the three  and nine  months  ended  september  30,  2000,
compared with the same periods in 1999.  on a combined  basis,  packet  services
(frame relay,  atm  (asynchronous  transfer  mode) and ip) grew over 50% for the
quarter and over 45% for the year-to-date period, compared with the same periods
in 1999.

at&amp;t; solutions outsourcing revenue, normalized for the acquisition of agns, grew
20.2% in the third quarter of 2000,  and grew 22.5% for the first nine months of
2000,  compared with the same periods in the prior year.  these  increases  were
primarily  due to growth from new  contract  signings and add-on  business  from
existing clients.

normalized long distance voice revenue declined at a mid  single-digit  rate for
the third  quarter,  as  pricing  declines  outpaced  high  single-digit  volume
increases.  for the year-to-date period,  normalized long distance voice revenue
declined  at a low  single-digit  rate,  as  pricing  declines  outpaced  volume
increases of over 10%.  business  services revenue  continues to shift to higher
growth products such as data/ip and  outsourcing.  this shift, and the continued
pricing pressures, have resulted in a decline in long distance voice revenue. we
expect competition and the resulting pricing pressures to continue to negatively
impact business services long distance voice revenue.

normalized local voice revenue grew at a mid-teen rate for the quarter, and grew
over 20% for the year-to-date period. revenue growth was negatively impacted, in
the year-to-date period, by the settlement of public utility commission rulings.
there were eight additional switches activated in third quarter,  for a total of
29 new local switches activated  year-to-date  through september 30, 2000. these
local switches  enhance  at&amp;t;'s  network  capacity for the provision of business
local voice services. at&amp;t;'s integrated business local operations added over 130
thousand  access  lines in the third  quarter  bringing  total  access  lines in
service as of  september  30, 2000,  to almost 2.1 million.  access lines enable
at&amp;t; to provide local service to customers by allowing  direct  connection  from

ebit/ebitda
ebit  increased  $224  million,  or 14.8%,  in the third  quarter  of 2000,  and
increased $334 million, or 7.4%, in the first nine months of 2000, compared with
the same prior year periods.  ebitda  increased $317 million,  or 13.5%,  in the
third quarter of 2000,  and increased  $646 million,  or 9.3%, in the first nine
months of 2000,  compared  with the same prior year  periods.  excluding a first
quarter 2000 restructuring charge of $93 million, ebit increased 9.4% and ebitda
increased 10.6% in the first nine months of 2000,  compared with the same period
of 1999.  the quarterly  increases  were  primarily  due to continued  sg&amp;a; cost
control  efforts  and  revenue  growth,  partially  offset by the  impact of the
customers contributed to concert. the year-to-date  increases were primarily due
to revenue growth and continued sg&amp;a; cost control  efforts,  partially offset by
the  impact  of the  customers  contributed  to  concert.  in  addition,  higher
depreciation  expense also  partially  offset the ebit  improvement.  the equity
earnings of concert are reported within corporate and other.

other items
capital  additions  decreased $446 million,  or 22.7%,  to $1,517 million in the
third quarter of 2000 compared with the third quarter of 1999.  the decrease was
primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures for network assets that support
long  distance  voice  and data  services.  for the first  nine  months of 2000,
capital  additions  decreased $375 million,  or 8.2%, to $4,169 million compared
with the first nine months 1999.  the decrease was  primarily  driven by reduced
capital  expenditures  for  network  assets that  support  long  distance  voice
services.

total assets increased $1,350 million,  or 4.2%, to $33,360 million at september
30, 2000,  compared with december 31, 1999. the increase was primarily driven by
a higher accounts receivable balance due to timing of cash receipts, an increase
in the age of  outstanding  receivables  and higher  revenue in our  outsourcing
business.  in addition,  property,  plant and equipment increased as a result of
capital  expenditures,  partially offset by depreciation expense for the period,
as well as the contribution of assets to concert.

consumer services
our consumer services segment provides a variety of any-distance  communications
services  including  long  distance,  local toll  (intrastate  calls outside the
immediate local area) and internet access to residential customers. in addition,
consumer services provides transaction services such as prepaid calling card and
operator-handled  calling  services.  local  phone  service is also  provided in
certain areas.

revenue
consumer  services  revenue  decreased  16.2% in the third quarter of 2000,  and
declined 11.0% for the first nine months of 2000, compared with the same periods
in 1999.  normalized  for the impact of concert and the  elimination of per-line
charges,  revenue decreased 10.9% in the third quarter and declined 7.9% for the
first nine months of the year as long  distance  calling  volumes  continued  to
decline at a mid single-digit  rate during these periods.  these results reflect
the ongoing competitive nature of the consumer long distance industry, which has
resulted  in  pricing  pressures  and a loss of market  share.  also  negatively
impacting revenue was product substitution and market migration away from direct
dial  wireline  and  calling  card  services  to the  rapidly  growing  wireless
services.  we  expect  competition  and  product  substitution  to  continue  to
negatively impact consumer services revenue.

ebit/ebitda
ebit  declined  14.1% and ebitda  declined  15.2% in the third  quarter of 2000,
compared  with the same  period of 1999.  for the first nine months of the year,
ebit decreased 7.3% and ebitda decreased 8.9%,  compared with the same period in
1999.  ebit and ebitda  continue  to be  negatively  impacted  by the decline in
revenue,  however,  reflecting  our cost  control  initiatives,  ebit and ebitda
margins continue to improve. the ebit margin was 39.7% and the ebitda margin was
42.7% in the third quarter of 2000, compared with an ebit margin of 38.7% and an
ebitda  margin of 42.2% for the same period in 1999.  ebit and ebitda  include a
$96 million  restructuring charge for the first nine months of 2000, and include
a $153  million  gain on the sale of  language  line  services in the first nine
months of 1999.  excluding these items,  the ebit and ebitda margins improved to
37.5% and 40.4%, respectively,  for the first nine months of 2000, compared with
34.5% and 37.9%, respectively, for the same period in 1999, primarily due to our
cost control initiatives, partially offset by lower revenue.

other items
capital  additions  declined $57 million,  or 43.0%, to $76 million in the third
quarter of 2000,  compared  with the third  quarter of 1999.  for the first nine
months of 2000,  capital additions  decreased $137 million,  or 40.1%,  compared
with the first nine months of 1999. these decreases were primarily  attributable
to reduced  capital  expenditures  for network assets that support long distance
voice services and decreased spending on internal-use software.

total assets decreased $1,334 million,  or 21.3%, to $4,945 million at september
30,  2000,  compared  with  december 31,  1999,  primarily  due to a decrease in
property,  plant and equipment as a result of the contribution of certain assets
to concert,  coupled with  depreciation  expense during the period. in addition,
accounts receivable declined as a result of lower revenue.

wireless services
our  wireless  services  segment  offers  wireless  voice and data  services and
products  to  customers  in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and  1900  megahertz
(personal  communications  services,  or pcs)  markets.  wireless  services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the united  states  and  internationally,  aviation  communications
services, and fixed wireless. fixed wireless provides high-speed internet access
and  any-distance  voice services using wireless  technology to residential  and
small business customers.

revenue
wireless services revenue grew $749 million,  or 36.6%, to $2,799 million in the
third quarter of 2000, compared with the third quarter of 1999, including growth
in  services  revenue  of 34.3% to  $2,509  million.  revenue  increased  $1,984
million,  or 36.2%, to $7,474 million in the first nine months of 2000, compared
with the same period of 1999,  including  growth in services revenue of 36.8% to
$6,741  million.  revenue,  adjusted  to exclude  the june 2000  acquisition  of
properties in the san francisco bay area from the quarter and year-to-date  2000
periods as well as the year-to-date  impact of vanguard cellular  systems,  inc.
for the months prior to the may 1999 acquisition,  grew 27.3% in the quarter and
29.7% for the first nine months of 2000.  the  increases  were due to subscriber
growth reflecting the continued successful execution of at&amp;t;'s wireless strategy
of targeting and retaining  specific customer  segments,  expanding the national
wireless footprint, focusing on digital service, and offering simple rate plans.
in addition,  an increase in average monthly revenue per user contributed to the
year-to-date  growth.  equipment revenue grew 59.9% to $290 million in the third
quarter of 2000,  and grew 30.6% to $733  million  for the first nine  months of
2000, compared with the respective prior year periods.

at&amp;t; continues to experience strong growth in wireless subscribers. consolidated
subscribers  grew to over 12.6 million at september  30, 2000,  representing  an
increase  of 38.4%  over the prior year  quarter,  including  approximately  1.3
million subscribers  associated with the completed acquisitions of our remaining
interest in cmt partners  (which owned wireless  properties in the san francisco
bay area),  wireless  one network,  l.p.  (which owned  wireless  properties  in
northwest  and  southwest  florida) and  properties  in the san diego area.  net
consolidated   wireless  subscriber  additions  in  the  third  quarter  totaled
approximately  750,000,  a 195.1%  increase over the prior year  quarter.  total
subscribers,  including  partnership  markets  in  which  at&amp;t;  does  not  own a
controlling interest,  were nearly 15 million at the end of the third quarter, a
26.2% increase over the prior year quarter. this includes  approximately 450,000
subscribers  associated  with the  acquisition of american  cellular in february
2000.  at&amp;t;'s average  monthly churn rate in the third quarter of 2000 was 2.9%,
compared with 2.6% in the third quarter of 1999.  at&amp;t;'s  average  monthly churn
rate in the first nine months of 2000 was 2.8%  compared  with 2.6% in the first
nine months of 1999.

ebit/ebitda excluding other income
ebit  increased $51 million,  or 97.2%,  to $105 million in the third quarter of
2000, and increased $423 million,  or 331.1%,  to $551 million in the first nine
months of the year, compared with the same prior year periods.  the year-to-date
increase was  impacted by a second  quarter 2000 gain of $95 million on the sale
of  celumovil  and a second  quarter  1999  gain of $88  million  on the sale of
wood-tv.  excluding these gains,  ebit improved $416 million to $456 million for
the  first  nine  months of the  year.  the  improvement  for both  periods  was
primarily  the result of revenue  growth,  as well as higher other income due to
intercompany  interest income on the initial public offering proceeds attributed
to at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  these were  partially  offset by  increased  customer
acquisition  and customer care costs and higher  depreciation  and  amortization
expenses as a result of an increased asset base.  also partially  offsetting the
improvements were higher network costs attributable to the growth in subscribers
and  their  minutes  of use,  as well as  higher  information  technology  costs
associated with growth in the subscriber base.

ebitda, excluding other income, increased $75 million, or 18.6%, to $472 million
in the third quarter of 2000,  and increased $479 million,  or 53.1%,  to $1,381
million for the first nine months of the year, compared with the same prior year
periods.  the  improvement  for both  periods  was  primarily  driven  by higher
revenue,  partially offset by increased  customer  acquisition and customer care
costs,  as well as higher  network  costs and increased  information  technology
costs.

other items
in the third quarter of 2000, capital additions increased $324 million to $1,028
million  compared with the third  quarter of 1999.  for the first nine months of
2000, capital additions increased $2,218 million to $3,782 million compared with
the first nine months of 1999.  these increases were primarily driven by capital
expenditures  on capacity  upgrades and  improvements to network  quality.  also
contributing  to the increase in capital  additions for the first nine months of
the year was our investment in american cellular in the first quarter of 2000.

total assets increased $9,733 million, or 41.8%, to $33,045 million at september
30, 2000,  compared with december 31, 1999. the increase was primarily driven by
the  acquisitions  of our  remaining  interest  in cmt  partners,  wireless  one
network,  l.p. and properties in the san diego area. these acquisitions resulted
in increases to licensing  costs,  goodwill,  property,  plant and equipment and
other assets.  also  contributing  to the increase in assets was an intercompany
note receivable for the remaining initial public offering proceeds attributed to
the at&amp;t; wireless  group, as well as higher  property,  plant and equipment as a
result of capital  expenditures in support of the continued  expansion and build
out of our wireless  network,  partially offset by depreciation  expense for the
period.

year-to-date 2000 results include a full nine months of tci results,  while 1999
includes only seven months of tci results reflecting the march 1999 acquisition.

revenue
broadband's  revenue increased $912 million,  or 60.7%, for the third quarter of
2000,  and  increased  $2,212  million,  or  63.6%,  for the nine  months  ended
september 30, 2000, compared with the same periods of last year. the increase in
revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of mediaone results since the date of
acquisition,  higher revenue from new services  (digital video,  high-speed data
and  telephony) and a basic cable rate  increase.  in addition,  revenue for the
nine months ended  september 30, 2000, was impacted by the acquisition of tci in
march of 1999. revenue, normalized for the mediaone acquisition and adjusted for
the net disposition of cable properties, increased 10.8% in the third quarter of
2000 compared with the third quarter of 1999.  revenue for the nine months ended
september 30, 2000, on this same basis and normalized  for the tci  acquisition,
increased 9.9% compared with the same prior year period.

broadband  ended  the  third  quarter  of 2000 with  16.1  million  basic  cable
customers,  passing  approximately  28  million  homes,  more  than 2.5  million
digital-video  customers,  approximately 888,000 high-speed data customers,  and
provided  telephony  service  to  nearly  350,000  customers.  while  we  expect
broadband  revenue to  continue  to grow,  the rate of growth may be impacted by
slower  than  anticipated  telephony  and  basic  subscriber  additions  due  to
increased competition.

ebit/ebitda excluding other income
ebit was a deficit of $627  million for the quarter  ended  september  30, 2000,
compared  with a deficit of $310  million in 1999.  excluding  the impact of our
ownership  interests in cablevision and twe and restructuring and other charges,
ebit for the third quarter of 2000, was a deficit of $431 million,  a decline of
$233 million from the third quarter of 1999.  this decrease was primarily due to
the acquisition of mediaone,  increased spending associated with cable telephony
and high-speed data services and higher  programming costs. these were partially
offset by higher revenue and lower equity losses due to  dispositions of certain
investments  in 1999.  ebit for the nine months ended  september 30, 2000, was a
deficit of $717 million compared with a deficit of $1,187 million in 1999.

excluding the impact of our ownership  interests in cablevision and twe, certain
gains and  restructuring  and other charges,  ebit was a deficit of $720 million
for the nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  compared with a deficit of $439
million in 1999.  the decrease was primarily due to higher  expenses  associated
with  high-speed  data and telephony  services,  the acquisition of mediaone and
increased  programming costs.  partially  offsetting these decreases to ebit was
higher  revenue  and lower  equity  losses  due to the  disposition  of  certain
investments in 1999.

ebitda,  excluding  other income,  for the third  quarter was $514  million,  an
increase of 32.1%,  compared with the third quarter of 1999.  excluding the 2000
restructuring and other charges, ebitda, excluding other income, increased 38.2%
to $538 million in the third quarter of 2000. this increase was primarily due to
the mediaone acquisition and higher revenue, partially offset by higher expenses
associated  with  high-speed  data and  telephony  services as well as increased
programming  costs.  ebitda,  excluding  other  income for the nine months ended
september 30, 2000, was $1,253  million  compared with $420 million for the same
period of 1999.  excluding the 2000 and 1999  restructuring  and other  charges,
ebitda,  excluding other income, increased 42.1% to $1,293 million in 2000. this
increase  was  primarily  due to higher  revenue,  the  inclusion of a full nine
months of tci and the  acquisition of mediaone.  these  increases were partially
offset by higher expenses associated with high-speed data and telephony services
as well as increased programming costs.

capital  additions  in the  third  quarter  of 2000  increased  23.8% to  $1,247
million,  and  increased  66.0% to  $3,577  million  for the nine  months  ended
september  30, 2000.  the  increases  were due to capital  expenditures  for the
launch of new services as well as the mediaone acquisition. in addition, capital
expenditures  for the  year-to-date  period  increased  due to  spending  on the
upgrade of the cable plant.  capital additions for the year-to-date  period were
also impacted by increased contributions to various nonconsolidated investments.

total assets were $117,289 million at september 30, 2000,  compared with $53,810
million at december 31, 1999. the increase was due to the mediaone  acquisition,
and an  increase  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  as a result  of  capital
expenditures,  partially  offset by depreciation  expense for the period.  these
increases were partially offset by a decrease in the mark-to-market valuation of
certain  investments and lower franchise costs and property,  plant property and
equipment as a result of the exchange of an entity owning  certain cable systems
and other assets with cox for at&amp;t; stock.

revenue
revenue  for  corporate  and  other   primarily   includes  the  elimination  of
inter-segment  revenue of negative $222 million (an increase of $32 million from
the third quarter of 1999),  revenue from  excite@home of $79 million (which was
consolidated beginning on september 1, 2000), and revenue from our international
operations and ventures of $78 million (a decline of $242 million from the third
quarter of 1999). the international operations and ventures revenue decrease was
largely due to the revenue  impact of businesses  contributed to concert and due
to  lower  revenue  associated  with the  divestment  of  certain  international
businesses.  corporate and other  revenue,  normalized  for the  divestments  of
international businesses, the impact of concert and excite@home was negative $21
million in the third quarter of 2000, compared with negative $47 million for the
third quarter of 1999. the  improvement was primarily due to higher revenue from
excite@home.

for the first nine months of 2000,  revenue for  corporate  and other  primarily
included the elimination of  inter-segment  revenue of negative $585 million (an
increase of $29 million  from the first nine months of 1999),  revenue  from our
international operations and ventures of $262 million (a decline of $682 million
from the first nine months of 1999) and revenue from  excite@home of $79 million
(which  was  consolidated   beginning  september  1,  2000).  the  international
operations and ventures  revenue  decrease was largely due to the revenue impact
of businesses  contributed to concert and due to lower revenue  associated  with
the divestment of certain international businesses. corporate and other revenue,
normalized  for the  divestments  of  international  businesses,  the  impact of
concert and  excite@home,  was negative $174 million in the first nine months of
2000  compared  with  negative  $223  million for the first nine months of 1999,
primarily due to higher revenue from  excite@home as well as higher revenue from
international operations and ventures.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda for  corporate  and other  improved $358 million to a deficit of
$40 million and improved  $399  million to $219  million,  respectively,  in the
third quarter of 2000,  compared  with the third quarter of 1999.  excluding the
third  quarter  1999 gain on the sale of at&amp;t; canada of $110  million,  ebit and
ebitda  for  corporate  and  other  increased  $468  million  and $509  million,
respectively,  in the third quarter of 2000,  compared with the third quarter of
1999.  the  increases  were  primarily  due to a larger  pension  credit in 2000
primarily  driven by a higher  pension trust asset base resulting from increased
investment  returns,  lower sg&amp;a; expenses,  including cost control efforts,  and
higher  other income as a result of  increased  gains on sales of  miscellaneous
investments.  in addition,  equity  earnings for concert were $25 million during
the third quarter.

ebit and ebitda for  corporate  and other  improved $145 million to a deficit of
$1,020  million and  improved  $244  million to a deficit of $398 million in the
first nine months of 2000, compared with the same period in 1999, respectively.

excluding net restructuring  charges of $568 million in 2000 and $212 million in
1999, as well as the 1999 gain on the sale of at&amp;t; canada of $110 million,  ebit
and ebitda  increased  $611 million to a deficit of $452  million and  increased
$710 million to $170 million in the first nine months of 2000, compared with the
same period in 1999, respectively.  the increases were primarily due to a larger
pension  credit in 2000  primarily  driven by a higher  pension trust asset base
resulting from increased investment returns,  higher other income as a result of
increased  gains on sales of  miscellaneous  investments and higher interest and
dividend income as well as cost control  efforts.  in addition,  equity earnings
for  concert  were $91 million  during the first nine months of 2000.  partially
offsetting  these  improvements  were higher equity losses from  excite@home and
greater distributions on trust preferred securities.

other items

capital additions for corporate and other increased $931 million,  or 111.8%, to
$1,763  million in the third quarter of 2000,  compared with the same quarter of
1999.  for the first  nine  months of 2000,  capital  additions  increased  $657
million,  or 50.6%,  to $1,955  million  compared  with the first nine months of
1999.  the increase in both periods was  primarily  driven by our  investment in
net2phone,    partially   offset   by   lower   investments   in   international
nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

total assets  increased  $8,949 million during the first nine months of 2000, to
$24,484  million  primarily  due  to  the  consolidation  of  excite@home,   our
investment in concert, including the assets contributed by business services and
consumer services, and our investment in net2phone.

liberty media group results
liberty  media group (lmg)  produces,  acquires and  distributes  entertainment,
educational and informational programming services through all available formats
and  media.  lmg is  also  engaged  in  electronic  retailing  services,  direct
marketing  services,   advertising  sales  relating  to  programming   services,
infomercials and transaction  processing.  equity earnings (losses) from liberty
media group were $1,756  million for the quarter ended  september 30, 2000,  and
were $(217) million in the comparable 1999 period. equity earnings (losses) from
lmg were $2,965 million for the first nine months of 2000,  compared with $(818)
million for the period from the date of acquisition  through september 30, 1999.
these  increases were primarily due to gains  associated with the acquisition of
companies  that lmg has an investment  in. the gains  represent  the  difference
between the carrying  value of lmg's  interest in the  acquired  company and the
fair value of securities received in the acquisitions.  in particular,  tv guide
was acquired by gemstar in the third  quarter of 2000,  flextech was acquired by
telewest in the second  quarter of 2000 and general  instrument  was acquired by
motorola in the first quarter of 2000.  these gains were partially offset by the
impairment  charges recorded on lmg's investments in teligent and icg to reflect
other than temporary declines in value.

net cash provided by operating  activities increased $2,124 million for the nine
months ended  september  30,  2000,  compared  with the prior year  period.  the
increase  was  primarily  driven  by an  increase  in  operating  income  before
depreciation  and  amortization  expense  and a  decrease  in cash tax  payments
primarily  resulting  from the first quarter 1999 tax payment on the gain on the
1998 sale of universal card services inc. these were partially  offset by higher
interest payments in 2000.

net cash used by investing  activities  for the nine months ended  september 30,
2000,  increased  $11,823  million  compared  with the prior  year  period.  the
increase was primarily  driven by increased  acquisitions in 2000,  particularly
mediaone and various wireless properties, increased capital expenditures in 2000
primarily  attributable to growth in wireless and broadband,  and our investment
in net2phone,  partially  offset by the  contribution of $5.5 billion of cash to
lmg in 1999.

during the first nine months of 2000, net cash provided by financing  activities
increased by $12,151 million  compared with the prior year period.  the increase
was primarily due to higher  proceeds  from  issuance of  short-term  debt,  the
proceeds from the initial  public  offering of at&amp;t; wireless  group shares and a
decrease in the purchase of treasury stock. these were partially offset by lower
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and redeemable securities in 1999.

at  september  30,  2000,  we had  current  assets of $15.5  billion and current
liabilities of $51.3 billion. a significant portion of the current  liabilities,
$32.3 billion,  relate to short-term notes, the majority of which was commercial
paper or debt with an original  maturity of one year or less.  we expect that we
will retire a portion of the  short-term  debt with funds that will be generated
from the expected  mid-2001  initial public offering of at&amp;t; broadband  tracking
stock.  in addition,  we continue to investigate  and negotiate  other financing
alternatives including, the monetization of publicly-held  securities,  sales of
certain non-strategic assets and investments, securitization of certain accounts
receivable,  and a potential  separate  debt  offering by at&amp;t;  wireless.  since
september 30, 2000, we have monetized  certain publicly held securities  through
the issuance of approximately $1 billion of asset-backed  debt.  lastly,  we are
presently  in  negotiations  to increase  our $10 billion  line of credit to $25
billion.  at  september  30,  2000,  all of the $10  billion  line of credit was
available for our use.  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
financing on terms that are acceptable to us.

as a result of the announced  restructuring  plans to create four new companies,
at&amp;t;'s debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. as
a result of this review,  at&amp;t;'s ratings have been either downgraded and /or put
on credit watch with negative outlook. these actions will result in an increased
cost of future borrowings.

also in connection with our restructuring,  we are reviewing our dividend policy
as it  relates  to each of the  new  companies  we will  create.  the  board  of
directors' review of at&amp;t;'s dividend policy will be completed and implemented by
the end of the year. we expect that at&amp;t;'s dividend prior to the creation of the
four new  companies as well as the combined  dividend of the four new  companies
will be substantially lower than our current dividend.

during the  quarter,  we granted  put  options  to cox and  comcast  corporation
(comcast)  on  shares  of  excite@home  series a common  stock  having a maximum
combined put price of $2.9 billion. the put options provide cox and comcast with
the right to convert their excite@home  shares into either at&amp;t; stock or cash at
their  option,  at any time  between  january 1, 2001 and june 4,  2002,  at the
higher of (i) $48 per share or (ii) the 30 day average trading price at the time
of the  exercise.  as a  result,  at&amp;t;  could  be  required  to pay the  maximum
aggregate $2.9 billion put price in january,  2001.  assuming a put price of $48
per share, the maximum number of excite@home  shares covered by the put would be
approximately 60.4 million shares.

earnings,  including other income,  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization,  and  minority  interest  (ebitda)  is a measure of our ability to
generate  cash flow and  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  but not as a
substitute for, other measures of financial  performance  reported in accordance
with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  ebitda was $16,448 million for
the first  nine  months of the year,  an  increase  of 18.1% over the first nine
months  of last  year.  the  ebitda  growth  was  impacted  by gains on sales of
businesses and investments and other, net restructuring  and other charges,  and
our ownership  interests in cablevision and twe.  excluding these items,  ebitda
increased $2,441 million,  or 16.9%,  over the first nine months of last year to
$16,841 million.  the improvement was primarily due to operational  efficiencies
which resulted in higher operating income before  depreciation and amortization,
and increased other income.

euro conversion
on january 1, 1999,  certain  members of the european  union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the european  union's
currency (euro).  the transition period is anticipated to extend between january
1, 1999,  and july 1, 2002.  we have  assessed the impact of the  conversion  on
information-technology  systems,  currency  exchange rate risk,  derivatives and
other financial instruments,  continuity of material contracts as well as income
tax and accounting issues. we do not expect the conversion during the transition
period to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

financial condition
total  assets  increased  $82,946  million,  or 49.0%,  to  $252,352  million at
september 30, 2000, compared with december 31, 1999, primarily due to the impact
of  the  mediaone  acquisition  and  the  consolidation  of  excite@home.  other
significant  activity included  increased  property,  plant and equipment due to
capital  expenditures,  net of  depreciation  expense;  an  increase in licenses
resulting  from  our  wireless   acquisitions,   increased  accounts  receivable
attributable  to  transactions  with concert;  our investment in net2phone;  and
at&amp;t;'s investment in concert,  consisting of $1.7 billion of property, plant and
equipment and a loan of $1.0 billion.

total liabilities  increased  $45,102 million,  or 54.1%, to $128,490 million at
september 30, 2000, compared with december 31, 1999, primarily due to the impact
of the mediaone  acquisition and the consolidation of excite@home.  in addition,
total debt increased due to borrowings to fund the mediaone acquisition.

minority   interest   increased  $6,655  million  to  $9,046  million  primarily
reflecting the minority interest of excite@home.

total  shareowners'  equity  increased  $31,181  million,  or 39.5%, to $110,108
million at september 30, 2000, compared with december 31, 1999. the increase was
primarily  driven  by the  issuance  of  at&amp;t;  common  stock  for  the  mediaone
acquisition as well the issuance of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.

the ratio of total debt to total  capital,  excluding lmg (debt divided by total
debt and  equity  of at&amp;t;,  excluding  lmg) was  45.0% at  september  30,  2000,
compared with 44.3% at december 31, 1999. the equity portion of this calculation
includes  convertible  trust  preferred  securities.  the increase was primarily
driven by higher debt  associated  with the  mediaone  merger,  almost  entirely
offset by a higher equity base  associated with the mediaone merger and the at&amp;t;
wireless group initial public offering.  included in debt is approximately  $5.2
billion of notes,  which are exchangeable  into or  collaterialized  by vodafone
american  depository  receipts (adrs) we own.  excluding this debt, the ratio of
debt to total capital at september 30, 2000,  was 42.8%.  the ratio of debt (net
of cash) to  operational  ebitda was 2.74x at september 30, 2000,  compared with
1.75x at december 31,  1999,  reflecting  additional  debt  associated  with the
mediaone merger.

risk management

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest,  foreign exchange rates,
and  equity  prices.  on a limited  basis we use  certain  derivative  financial
instruments,   including  interest  rate  swaps,  options,  forwards  and  other
derivative contracts to manage these risks. we do not use financial  instruments
for trading or  speculative  purposes.  all  financial  instruments  are used in
accordance with board-approved policies.

assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest rates at september 30, 2000, the fair
value of unhedged debt would have increased by approximately $1.1 billion.

new accounting pronouncements
in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards board (fasb) issued statement
of financial  accounting  standards  (sfas) no. 133,  "accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging  activities."  among other provisions,  it requires that
entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
qualifies for hedge accounting. the effective date for this standard was delayed
via the issuance of sfas no. 137. the effective date for sfas no. 133 is now for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  june  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.  for at&amp;t;, this means that
the standard must be adopted no later than january 1, 2001.

in june 2000, the fasb issued sfas no. 138,  "accounting for certain  derivative
instruments  and certain  hedging  activities"  as an amendment to sfas no. 133.
this  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
issues under sfas no. 133 on specific types of hedges.

the impact of the  adoption  of sfas no.  133,  as amended by sfas no.  138,  on
at&amp;t;'s  results  of  operations  is  dependent  upon  the  fair  values  of  our
derivatives and related financial  instruments at the date of adoption and could
result in more pronounced  quarterly  fluctuations in other income  (expense) in
future  periods.  however,  had we adopted sfas no. 133 in the third  quarter of
2000, we would have recorded a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of
applicable taxes, of approximately  $325 million of income, or $0.08 per diluted
share,  primarily  attributable  to fair value  adjustments  of  monetized  debt
instruments  acquired in conjunction with the mediaone merger, as well as to our
warrant portfolio. management does not expect the impact of the adoption of sfas
no. 133 on our interest rate swap and foreign exchange portfolios to be material
to at&amp;t;'s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

in addition,  management is currently reassessing the appropriate classification
of certain  investment  securities  that  support debt which is indexed to those
securities.  had these securities been reclassified from  available-for-sale  to
trading securities during the third quarter, a charge of $235 million,  or $0.06
per diluted share,  net of applicable  taxes,  would have been recorded to other
income  (expense),  concurrently  with  the  adoption  of sfas  no.  133.  as an
available-for-sale  security,  changes in fair value are  included  within other
comprehensive income.

in december 1999, the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting
bulletin no. 101 (sab no. 101), "revenue  recognition in financial  statements."
the sec  delayed the date by which  registrants  must apply the  accounting  and
disclosures  described  in sab  no.  101  until  the  fourth  quarter  of  2000.
management does not expect the adoption of sab no. 101 to have a material impact
on our results of operations.

subsequent events

restructuring plan
on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; announced a restructuring plan designed to create four
publicly  traded  companies  from  each  of  our  major  operating  units.  at&amp;t;
shareowners  would  ultimately  own stock in each of the four  businesses.  upon
completion of the plan, at&amp;t; wireless,  at&amp;t;  broadband,  at&amp;t; consumer and at&amp;t;
business will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.

in the  first  phase of the  restructuring  plan,  at&amp;t;  intends  to offer  at&amp;t;
shareowners  the  opportunity  to  exchange  their  at&amp;t;  common  stock for at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock.  we plan to distribute our remaining  interest in
at&amp;t; wireless group to at&amp;t; shareowners in 2001.

at&amp;t; also plans to create a new class of stock to track the economic performance
of our at&amp;t; consumer business and plans to distribute 100% of the tracking stock
to at&amp;t; shareowners in the second half of 2001. in addition, depending on market
conditions,  at&amp;t; plans to conduct an initial public offering of stock that will
track the economic  performance of our broadband unit during the summer of 2001.
at&amp;t;'s ownership  interest in excite@home will be part of the broadband  entity.
at&amp;t; plans to  recapitalize  the broadband  tracking  stock into an  asset-based
common stock within twelve months of the initial public offering.

at&amp;t; business  will be the legal owner of the at&amp;t; brand,  which it will license
to the other companies.  it will also be the parent company of the at&amp;t; consumer
business.

the board of directors is reviewing  the dividend  policy of at&amp;t; before the end
of 2000 and at&amp;t; expects that at&amp;t;'s  dividend prior to the creation of the four
new companies as well as the combined dividend of the four new companies will be
substantially lower than our current dividend.

at&amp;t; does not expect significant  downsizing to result from our plans,  although
each company will continue to size its operations as  appropriate.  at&amp;t; expects
these transactions will be tax-free to u.s. shareholders. certain aspects of the
above transactions remain subject to regulatory and other approvals.

other events

at&amp;t;  currently  holds a 55.62% equity  interest in ab cellular  holding llc (ab
cellular), which was formed in 1998 with bellsouth, with each party having a 50%
voting interest.  ab cellular owns,  controls and supervises wireless properties
in los  angeles,  houston and  galveston.  public  documents  filed by bellsouth
indicate  that  bellsouth  anticipates  exercising  an option  available to them
pursuant to the ab cellular  llc  agreement,  which would  result in ab cellular
redeeming  at&amp;t;'s  interest in ab cellular in  consideration  of 100% of the net
assets of the los  angeles  property.  if this  transaction  takes  place,  at&amp;t;
anticipates recording a gain and will begin consolidating the results of the los
angeles property.

on november 13, 2000,  two of at&amp;t;'s  wireless  affiliates,  telecorp  pcs, inc.
(telecorp)  and  tritel,  inc.,  merged  as  part  of a  stock  transaction.  in
connection  with the merger,  at&amp;t;  contributed  to  telecorp  rights to acquire
wireless  licenses in wisconsin and iowa and $20 million in cash in exchange for
approximately  9.3 million shares of common stock in the newly merged entity. in
a separate  transaction,  at&amp;t; exchanged certain wireless licenses and rights to
acquire  licenses in the wisconsin and iowa markets,  and made a cash payment of
approximately  $80  million in return for  certain  telecorp  pcs  licenses  and
wireless  systems  in several  new  england  markets.  at&amp;t;  expects  that these
transactions will result in a gain.

item 1.  legal proceedings.

mediaone shareholder litigation
in march 1999,  several  putative  class action  complaints  were filed  against
mediaone  group,  inc.  and certain of its  officers  and  directors in delaware
chancery  court,  subsequently  consolidated  under the caption,  in re mediaone
group inc. shareholders  litigation,  c.a. no. 17037, alleging that the mediaone
directors  had  breached  their  fiduciary  duties to mediaone  shareholders  by
causing  mediaone to enter into a merger  agreement  with comcast corp.  without
taking the  necessary  steps to obtain the best price  available  upon a sale of
control of mediaone.  a similar suit was filed in new york  supreme  court,  new
york county,  under the caption krim v. cote, et al., no.  99-602028.  after the
suits were filed,  mediaone  terminated the comcast merger agreement in order to
accept a  superior  proposal  from  at&amp;t.;  thereafter,  on august  13,  1999,  a
consolidated and amended class action complaint was filed in the delaware action
alleging that the mediaone  directors could only fulfill their fiduciary  duties
in connection  with the at&amp;t; merger if, among other things,  they caused at&amp;t; to
issue one or more tracking stocks as part of the consideration in the merger. on
december 6, 1999, with the consent of mediaone,  at&amp;t; announced plans to issue a
new class of common stock to track its wireless  operations.  mediaone's consent
was conditioned upon the agreement of at&amp;t; that no distribution, or setting of a
record date for the  distribution,  of this tracking  stock to holders of common
stock of at&amp;t; occur prior to the effective time of mediaone's  merger with at&amp;t.;
on june 15,  2000,  mediaone  consummated  its  merger  with  at&amp;t; and  became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of at&amp;t.;

in  light  of these  events,  plaintiffs  in the  mediaone  shareholder  actions
stipulated to the dismissal of the actions as moot. as part of the  stipulation,
at&amp;t; agreed to pay and  plaintiffs'  attorneys  agreed to accept the sum of $340
thousand in full  satisfaction and discharge of their claim for compensation for
legal services  performed and  reimbursement of expenses  incurred in connection
with the prosecution of the actions.  on august 28, 2000, the delaware  chancery
court  approved  the  dismissal  of the  delaware  actions on mootness  grounds,
conditioned  upon the  dismissal  of the new york  action and the  provision  of
notice of the terms of the stipulation in at&amp;t;'s next form 10-q.

other litigation
on july 6, 1997,  mci  telecommunications  corp.  and ronald a. katz  technology
licensing,  l.p.  filed suit in united states  district  court in  philadelphia,
pennsylvania  against  at&amp;t.;  the suit  alleged  that a number of at&amp;t;  services
infringe patents owned by katz but licensed to mci for enforcement against at&amp;t.;
on november 1, 2000,  without any  admission of liability or  wrongdoing  of any
kind, at&amp;t; settled this matter for an undisclosed amount.

in october and  november  2000,  the company was named as a defendant in several
purported  securities  class action lawsuits filed in the united states district
courts for the district of new jersey and for the southern  district of new york
purportedly  filed on behalf of persons who purchased  securities of the company
for various  periods from october 25, 1999 through may 1, 2000.  these  lawsuits
assert claims under section  10(b) and 20(a) of the  securities  exchange act of
1934,  as  amended,  and  allege,  among  other  things,  that during the period
referenced  above, the company made materially  false and misleading  statements
and omitted to state material facts  concerning its future  business  prospects.
the complaints seek unspecified  damages. the company believes that the lawsuits
are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.

                     management's discussion and analysis of

                  results of operations and financial condition

overview

on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; completed an initial public  offering of 15.6%,  or 360
million  shares,  of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at an initial public
offering  price of  $29.50  per  share.  this  stock is  designed  to track  the
performance  of at&amp;t;'s  wireless  services  businesses.  the at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock issued in the initial public offering reflected only a portion of
the economic  interest of the at&amp;t; wireless  group.  at&amp;t; retained the remaining
interest in the economic  performance  of the at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of
an inter-group  interest  which  represented an 84.4% interest as of the date of
the initial  public  offering and at september  30, 2000.  the results  included
herein  represent  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  in its  entirety  for all  periods
presented.  for the portion of the at&amp;t; wireless  group's results  attributed to
the public shareholders, see at&amp;t;'s form 10-q.

on october 25, 2000,  at&amp;t;  announced  its intention to dispose of its remaining
interest in the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking  stock,  which has been approved by
at&amp;t;'s board of  directors.  at&amp;t; intends to offer at&amp;t; common  shareowners  the
opportunity  to exchange  at&amp;t; common  stock for at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracking
stock.  at&amp;t; plans to  distribute  its  remaining  interest in the at&amp;t; wireless
group tracking stock to at&amp;t; common  shareowners in 2001. upon completion of the
exchange offer and distribution, at&amp;t; intends to convert the at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock into an asset-based  at&amp;t; wireless common stock and distribute to
its shareowners.

the at&amp;t; wireless  group is a fully  integrated  business unit of at&amp;t.; the at&amp;t;
wireless  group  includes  the  results  of  its  mobility  and  fixed  wireless
businesses, as well as its international operations, which primarily include the
earnings or losses  associated with equity interests in  international  wireless
communications ventures and partnerships.

on september 29, 2000,  the at&amp;t; wireless group  completed the  acquisition of a
wireless  system  in san  diego,  which  covers a  population  base of 3 million
potential  customers.  also,  during the third quarter,  the at&amp;t; wireless group
completed  its  acquisition  of a  wireless  system on the big island of hawaii.
combined,  these two markets  served more than 180  thousand  subscribers  as of
september 30, 2000. in june 2000, the at&amp;t; wireless group closed the acquisition
of the  remaining  50%  partnership  interest it  previously  did not own in cmt
partners (bay area properties).  the bay area properties cover a population base
exceeding 7 million potential  customers and, as of the acquisition date, served
nearly 1 million  subscribers.  the  acquisition of the wireless  systems in san
diego and the bay area was  announced  in  conjunction  with the  signing  of an
agreement to purchase a wireless  system in houston,  which is expected to close
during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2000.  also in june,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group
completed its acquisition of wireless one network, l.p. (wireless one). wireless
one owns and  operates  wireless  systems in  northwest  and  southwest  florida
covering  a  population  base  of  1.6  million  potential   customers  and  had
approximately  190 thousand  subscribers as of the acquisition date. in february
2000,  at&amp;t; and  dobson  communications  corporation,  through a joint  venture,
acquired  american  cellular  corporation.  at&amp;t; contributed its interest in the
joint venture to the at&amp;t; wireless group as of the date of the acquisition. this
acquisition  increased the at&amp;t; wireless  group's coverage in new york state and
several mid-west markets by adding  approximately 450 thousand subscribers as of
the acquisition date.

combined results of operations

for the three and nine months ended  september  30, 2000 compared with the three
and nine months ended september 30, 1999

revenue

total revenue  includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of handsets
and accessories,  and revenue  associated with the aviation  communications  and
fixed wireless  operations.  the at&amp;t; wireless group records revenue as services
are provided or when the product is sold.  services revenue  primarily  includes
monthly recurring charges,  airtime and toll usage charges,  and roaming charges
billed to  subscribers  for usage outside of the at&amp;t; wireless  group network as
well as  charges  billed to other  wireless  providers  for  roaming on the at&amp;t;
wireless group network.

total revenue  increased 36.6% to $2,799 million,  and increased 36.2% to $7,474
million for the three and nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  respectively,
compared  with the  respective  prior year periods.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's
results include the revenue  associated with the bay area properties  since june
29, 2000, and vanguard  cellular  systems,  inc.  (vanguard  cellular) since its
acquisition on may 3, 1999.  total revenue  increased  29.7% for the nine months
ended  september 30, 2000,  compared with the same period for 1999,  adjusted to
exclude the bay area  properties for the three months ended  september 30, 2000,
and to exclude  vanguard  cellular for the period january 2000 to april 2000, to
correlate results with 1999, due to the may 1999 acquisition.

the revenue  increases  for both the three and nine months ended  september  30,
2000, were primarily due to growth in our mobility business  revenue,  driven by
strong  consolidated  subscriber  growth.  additionally,  an increase in average
monthly  revenue per user (arpu) for the nine months ended  september  30, 2000,
compared with the respective prior year period,  contributed to the year-to-date
revenue  growth.  at&amp;t; digital one rate service,  including  additional  calling
plans  introduced  in  august  2000 as well as the  at&amp;t;  regional  and  digital
advantage  plans  announced  during the second  quarter  of 2000,  continues  to
contribute to growth in subscribers as well as an increase in arpu.

services  revenue for the three months  ended  september  30,  2000,  was $2,509
million,  an increase of $642 million,  or 34.3%,  compared with the  respective
period in 1999.  services  revenue for the nine months ended september 30, 2000,
was $6,741 million, an increase of $1,813 million,  or 36.8%,  compared with the
respective period in 1999.
<page>
as of  september  30,  2000,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  had over  12.6  million
consolidated subscribers, an increase of 38.4%, compared with the prior year, of
which 87.5% were digital  subscribers,  up from 73.5% as of september  30, 1999.
included  in  these  figures  were  over  180  thousand   subscribers  from  our
acquisitions  of the san diego and  hawaii  wireless  systems  during  the third
quarter of 2000,  nearly 1 million  subscribers  from our acquisition of the bay
area  properties  in june 2000 (which were  previously  reported as  partnership
subscribers) and approximately 190 thousand  subscribers from our acquisition of
wireless one in june 2000. net consolidated wireless subscriber additions in the
third  quarter  totaled  750  thousand,  a 195.1%  increase  over the prior year
quarter.  at&amp;t; wireless  group's average monthly churn rate in the third quarter
of 2000 was 2.9%  compared  with 2.6% in the  third  quarter  of 1999.  the at&amp;t;
wireless  group's  average monthly churn for the nine months ended september 30,
2000,  was 2.8%  compared  with 2.6% in the  respective  period  in 1999.  total
subscribers, including partnership markets in which the at&amp;t; wireless group does
not own a controlling  interest,  were nearly 15 million at the end of the third
quarter of 2000,  a 26.2%  increase  over the prior year  quarter.  ending total
subscribers included  approximately 450 thousand subscribers associated with the
at&amp;t; wireless group's acquisition of american cellular in february 2000.

the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's arpu for the three months ended  september 30, 2000,
was $68.5, an increase of $0.3, or 0.4%,  compared with the same period in 1999,
and for the nine months ended september 30, 2000, arpu was $69.1, an increase of
$3.7, or 5.7%, compared with the same period in 1999. the increase was primarily
due to increased minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part by the continued
success  of at&amp;t;  digital  one rate  service.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  arpu
remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average  during the
three and nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  excluding  the at&amp;t;  wireless
group.

equipment  revenue for the three  months  ended  september  30,  2000,  was $290
million, an increase of $108 million, or 59.9%, compared with the same period in
1999.  equipment  revenue for the nine months ended september 30, 2000, was $733
million, an increase of $171 million, or 30.6%, compared with the same period in
1999.  these  increases were primarily due to 85.5% and 47.4% increases in gross
consolidated  subscriber  additions in the three and nine months ended september
30, 2000,  respectively,  compared with the same periods in 1999. as an integral
part of the wireless service  offering,  the at&amp;t; wireless group supplies to its
subscribers a selection of handsets at competitive  prices,  which are generally
offered at or below cost.

costs of services and products

costs of services and products include the costs to place calls over the network
(including the costs to operate and maintain the at&amp;t; wireless  group's  network
as well as  roaming  costs  paid to  other  wireless  providers),  the  costs of
handsets and accessories provided to the at&amp;t; wireless group's customers and the
charges paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of at&amp;t.;

costs of services and products for the three and nine months ended september 30,
2000, were $1,381 million and $3,639 million, respectively. this was an increase
of $388 million,  or 39.2%,  for the three months ended  september 30, 2000, and
$896 million,  or 32.7%, for the nine months ended september 30, 2000,  compared
with the same periods in 1999.  these  increases were due primarily to increases
in the handsets  provided to subscribers which were attributable to the increase
in gross subscriber additions.  additionally,  growth in the subscriber base and
increased  minutes of use per  subscriber  resulted in an increase in the access
and other connection charges paid to connect calls on other networks,  including
at&amp;t;, as well as the costs to maintain the at&amp;t; wireless group's network.
<page>
roaming  expenses  decreased  12.5% and 3.0% for the three and nine months ended
september  30,  2000,  respectively,  compared  with the same  periods for 1999,
despite continued growth in off-network roaming minutes. the decrease in roaming
expenses was driven primarily by a significant  decrease in the roaming rate per
minute of usage,  as well as  initiatives to  aggressively  migrate more minutes
onto the at&amp;t; wireless group's network.

selling, general and administrative

selling,  general  and  administrative  (sg&amp;a;)  expenses  for the three and nine
months  ended  september  30,  2000,  were  $946  million  and  $2,459  million,
respectively,  compared  with $655 million and $1,833  million for the three and
nine months ended september 30, 1999. these increases were largely  attributable
to higher  marketing and selling costs,  primarily  advertising and commissions,
associated with the increase in gross consolidated  subscriber additions for the
three and nine months  ended  september  30,  2000,  compared to the  respective
periods in 1999. cost per gross subscriber  addition (cpga),  which includes the
cost of handset  subsidies  recorded  in costs of services  and  products in the
accompanying  combined statement of operations,  was $359 and $357 for the three
and nine months ended  september  30, 2000,  compared with $369 and $353 for the
three and nine months  ended  september  30, 1999.  in  addition,  growth in the
wireless  customer base resulted in an increase in  information  technology  and
customer care related expenses.

depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization  expenses for the three months ended september 30,
2000, were $445 million,  an increase of $112 million,  or 33.4%,  compared with
the third quarter of 1999.  depreciation and amortization  expenses for the nine
months  ended  september  30,  2000,  were $1,216  million,  an increase of $299
million, or 32.5%,  compared with the first nine months of 1999. these increases
primarily  resulted  from the growth in the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  depreciable
asset base resulting from capital  expenditures  to increase the capacity of the
network and improve call quality.  additionally,  amortization expense increased
for  the  nine  months  ended  september  30,  2000,  as a  result  of the  1999
acquisitions of vanguard cellular and honolulu cellular, and the acquisitions of
the bay area  properties  and wireless one in 2000.  total capital  expenditures
were $920  million  and  $3,043  million  for the three  and nine  months  ended
september 30, 2000, respectively.

other income (expense)

other income (expense)  primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges
of assets, net equity earnings from investments, intercompany interest income on
the  note  receivable   from  at&amp;t;,  and  minority   interests  in  consolidated
subsidiaries.  other  income  (expense)  for the  three  and nine  months  ended
september 30, 2000, was $78 million and $386 million, respectively. other income
(expense) for the three and nine months ended september 30, 1999, was expense of
$4 million and income of $180 million,  respectively. the increase for the three
months  ended  september  30, 2000 was due  primarily to  intercompany  interest
income on the note  receivable from at&amp;t.; the increase for the nine months ended
september 30, 2000,  was due primarily to  intercompany  interest  income on the
note receivable from at&amp;t;, as well as higher gains on the sales of assets.

interest expense

interest expense consists primarily of interest on intercompany debt due to at&amp;t;
less interest  expense  capitalized.  interest  expense for the third quarter of
2000,  was $4 million,  a decrease of $28 million,  or 88.5%,  compared with the
third  quarter of 1999.  interest  expense for the first nine months of 2000 was
<page>
$73 million, a decrease of $29 million,  or 28.4%,  compared with the first nine
months of 1999.  the decrease for the third  quarter of 2000,  compared with the
third  quarter of 1999,  was due to higher levels of  capitalized  interest as a
result of  increased  capital  expenditures,  as well as lower levels of average
outstanding  debt due to at&amp;t.; the decrease in the average  outstanding debt due
to at&amp;t; was  attributable to the  recapitalization  of $2.0 billion of long term
debt due to at&amp;t; into 9% cumulative  preferred  stock  subsequent to the initial
public offering of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.  these decreases were
partially offset by a higher rate of interest  charged on the intercompany  debt
in the third quarter of 2000 versus the prior year quarter.  for the nine months
ended september 30, 2000, the decrease in interest  expense was due to decreased
levels of outstanding debt, as well as increased capitalized interest, partially
offset by a higher interest rate.

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended september 30,
2000, was $80 million and $226 million, respectively,  compared with $14 million
and $31 million for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  the  increases for
both the three and nine month periods were due to higher income before taxes and
higher  effective tax rates.  the  effective  income tax rates for the three and
nine month periods ended september 30, 2000 were 78.9% and 47.8%,  respectively,
compared with 49.3% and 41.2%, for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  the
effective  income tax rate for the three months ended  september  30, 2000,  was
impacted by the increase in the estimated  annual effective tax rate. the annual
estimated  effective  income tax rate of 47.8% increased from the estimated rate
of 39.3% as of june 30, 2000. the annual estimated effective income tax rate was
impacted by  acquisitions  closed  during the quarter as well as foreign  equity
investments.  the  effective  income  tax  rate  for  each of the  1999  periods
presented was impacted by the benefit from a change in the  valuation  allowance
and other estimates, offset by unutilized foreign equity losses and amortization
of intangibles.

dividend requirements on preferred stock held by at&amp;t;

at september  30, 2000,  and december  31,  1999,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group had
outstanding,  $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock
held by at&amp;t; that pays dividends at 9% per annum.  intercompany  indebtedness of
$2.0 billion was recapitalized  into an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative
preferred stock following the initial public offering.  dividend requirements on
this  preferred  stock for the three and nine months ended  september  30, 2000,
were  $42  million  and $88  million,  respectively,  and for the  corresponding
periods in 1999 were $14 million and $41 million,  respectively,  net of amounts
recorded in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

liquidity and capital resources

the continued expansion of the at&amp;t; wireless group's network, footprint and
service offerings, and the marketing and distribution of its products and
services, will continue to require substantial capital.  the at&amp;t; wireless group
has funded its operations by initial public  offering  proceeds  attributed from
at&amp;t;,  intercompany borrowings from at&amp;t; and internally generated funds, as well
as capital contributions from at&amp;t; prior to the initial public offering. capital
contributions   from  at&amp;t;  prior  to  the  initial  public  offering   included
acquisitions  made by at&amp;t; that have been attributed to the at&amp;t; wireless group.
noncash  capital  contributions  from at&amp;t; to the at&amp;t; wireless group related to
acquisitions  and initial  investments  funded by at&amp;t;  totaled $539 million and
$2,332  million  for  the  nine  months  ended  september  30,  2000  and  1999,
respectively.
<page>
the initial  public  offering of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock resulted
in net proceeds to at&amp;t; after deducting  underwriter's discount and related fees
and expenses of $10.3 billion.  at&amp;t; attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds
to the at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany  note receivable.  net
transfers to and from the at&amp;t; wireless group and at&amp;t; subsequent to the initial
public offering are reflected as changes in the  intercompany  note  receivable.
after the attributed $7.0 billion of initial public offering  proceeds are fully
utilized,  at&amp;t; may issue  short term  floating  rate debt to the at&amp;t;  wireless
group.  in addition,  at&amp;t; is  considering  a debt offering by the at&amp;t; wireless
group.

on may 1, 2000,  following the initial public offering,  the at&amp;t; wireless group
recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t; into
an  additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred  stock held by at&amp;t.; in
conjunction with the recapitalization,  the at&amp;t; wireless group's long term debt
due to at&amp;t; was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a
fixed rate of 8.1% per annum.

financing  activities  for the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  are  managed  by at&amp;t; on a
centralized  basis and are  subject  to the  review of the at&amp;t;  wireless  group
capital stock committee.  sources for the at&amp;t; wireless group's future financing
requirements may include the issuance of additional at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock and the borrowing of funds,  including  short term floating rate debt from
at&amp;t; and/or third-party debt. loans from at&amp;t; to any member of the at&amp;t; wireless
group will be made at interest rates and on other terms and conditions  designed
to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rates  and  other  terms and
conditions  that the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  would be able to obtain  from  third
parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of at&amp;t; without the
benefit of any guaranty by at&amp;t.; this policy  contemplates that these loans will
be made on the basis set forth above  regardless of the interest rates and other
terms and  conditions  on which at&amp;t; may have acquired the funds.  if,  however,
at&amp;t; incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available  funds for use by the
at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  those  fees or  charges  will be  allocated  to the at&amp;t;
wireless group.

net cash provided by operating  activities  for the nine months ended  september
30, 2000,  was $861  million,  compared with $527 million for the same period in
1999. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to
an  increase  in  operating  income  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization,
resulting  from revenue growth and expense  leveraging,  an increase in deferred
income  taxes,   and  an  increase  in  other   operating  and  payroll  related
liabilities,   partially   offset  by  increases  in  inventories  and  accounts
receivable.  net cash used in  investing  activities  for the nine months  ended
september 30, 2000,  was $8,993  million,  compared with $1,158  million for the
nine months  ended  september  30, 1999.  the increase was due  primarily to the
issuance  of  a  note  receivable  from  at&amp;t;,  acquisitions  of  the  bay  area
properties,  wireless  one,  and the san  diego  property,  and  higher  capital
expenditures  to upgrade and increase  network  capacity in existing  markets as
well as to  expand  the  national  footprint.  net cash  provided  by  financing
activities  for the nine months ended  september 30, 2000,  was $8,132  million,
compared with $620 million for the nine months  september 30, 1999. the increase
was primarily due to proceeds attributed from the initial public offering of the
at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock and increased  transfers from at&amp;t; prior to
the  initial   public   offering  to  fund   acquisitions   and  higher  capital
expenditures.

ebitda,  excluding  other  income,  is the  primary  measure  used by the  chief
operating  decision-makers to measure our ability to generate cash flow. ebitda,
excluding  other  income,  defined as  operating  income plus  depreciation  and
<page>
amortization,  may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation of ebitda for
other public  companies and should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
to generally accepted accounting principles,  measures of performance or to cash
flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
liquidity.

ebitda,  excluding  other income,  for the three and nine months ended september
30, 2000, was $472 million and $1,376 million, respectively,  compared with $401
million  and $914  million  for the same  periods in 1999.  the  increases  were
primarily the result of revenue growth and lower  off-network  roaming expenses.
these improvements were partially offset by increased customer acquisition costs
associated with the increase in gross subscriber  additions,  increased  network
costs  attributable  to the growth in subscribers  and their minutes of use, and
increased information technology costs to support growth in the subscriber base.

for our mobility  business,  ebitda,  excluding other income,  for the three and
nine months  ended  september  30, 2000,  was $522  million and $1,503  million,
respectively,  compared  with $421 million and $973 million for the same periods
in 1999.

for our fixed wireless business,  ebitda,  excluding other income, for the three
and nine months ended  september 30, 2000, were deficits of $49 million and $123
million, respectively, compared with deficits of $17 million and $49 million for
the same periods in 1999.

ebitda,  excluding  other  income,  margins  were  16.8% and 18.4% for the third
quarter and first nine  months of 2000,  respectively,  compared  with 19.6% and
16.6% for the third  quarter  and first nine months of 1999,  respectively.  the
decline in ebitda,  excluding  other  income,  margins for the third  quarter of
2000,  compared to the third  quarter of 1999,  was  primarily  due to increased
customer acquisition costs associated with the 85.5% quarter over quarter growth
in  gross  consolidated  subscriber  additions,  as  well as  increased  cost of
handsets sold,  partially offset by declining roaming expenses.  the improvement
in ebitda,  excluding  other income,  margins for the first nine months of 2000,
compared  to the first  nine  months of 1999,  was driven  primarily  by revenue
growth and expense leveraging, primarily off-network roaming expenses, partially
offset by increased customer acquisition and customer care costs associated with
growth in the subscriber base.

ebitda, excluding other income, margins for our mobility business were 18.7% and
20.1%  for the  third  quarter  and first  nine  months  of 2000,  respectively,
compared  with 20.5% and 17.7% for the third  quarter  and first nine  months of
1999, respectively.

financial condition

total assets were  $33,045  million as of  september  30,  2000,  an increase of
$9,533 million, or 40.5%,  compared with december 31, 1999. the increase was due
primarily  to  increases  in  goodwill,  licensing  costs,  property,  plant and
equipment,  and other assets  associated  with the  acquisitions of the bay area
properties,  wireless  one,  and the san  diego  property,  the  initial  public
offering proceeds attributed to the at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t; in the form of
an intercompany note receivable,  and increased property, plant and equipment as
a result of  significant  capital  spending  in the first  nine  months of 2000.
additionally,   non-consolidated  investments  increased  as  a  result  of  the
investment in american cellular during 2000, partially offset by the acquisition
of the remaining 50% interest in cmt partners, which is now consolidated.
<page>
total  liabilities  were $8,542  million as of september 30, 2000, a decrease of
$953  million,  or 10.0%,  compared  with  december 31,  1999.  the decrease was
primarily due to the decrease in long term debt due to at&amp;t;  resulting  from the
recapitalization  of the at&amp;t; wireless  group  subsequent to the initial  public
offering,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  deferred  income  taxes,  other
long-term  liabilities,  and other current  liabilities.  deferred incomes taxes
increased due to the deferred tax provision recognized for the nine months ended
september  30,  2000.  other  long-term  liabilities  increased  due to proceeds
received in consideration for a long-term leasing arrangement, and other current
liabilities increased due to increased business taxes and operating accruals.

total  preferred  stock held by at&amp;t;  increased to $3.0 billion at september 30,
2000,  from $1.0 billion at december 31, 1999,  due to the  recapitalization  of
$2.0 billion of intercompany debt into preferred stock subsequent to the initial
public  offering.  dividends  payable on the preferred stock were paid at 9% per
annum.

total  equity was  $24,502  million as of  september  30,  2000,  an increase of
$10,505  million,  or 75.1%,  compared with december 31, 1999.  the increase was
primarily due to increased  combined  equity  associated with the attribution of
initial  public  offering  proceeds to the at&amp;t; wireless  group,  as well as net
transfers  from  at&amp;t;  prior to the  initial  public  offering  to fund  capital
expansion and  acquisitions,  and the additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock
issued to at&amp;t.;

recent accounting pronouncements

in december  1999, the  securities  and exchange  commission  (sec) issued staff
accounting   bulletin   (sab)  no.  101,   "revenue   recognition  in  financial
statements".  sab no. 101 provides  guidance on revenue  recognition,  including
service  activation fees, and certain related costs,  which requires adoption by
the end of fiscal year 2000.  management does not expect the adoption of sab no.
101 to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  results  of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards board (fasb) issued statement
of financial  accounting  standards  (sfas) no. 133,  "accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging  activities".  among other provisions,  it requires that
entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
qualifies for hedge accounting.  the effective date of this standard was delayed
via the issuance of sfas no. 137. the effective date for sfas no. 133 is now for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  june  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
encouraged and  retroactive  application  is  prohibited.  for the at&amp;t; wireless
group,  this means that the  standard  must be adopted no later than  january 1,
2001.  based on the types of contracts we currently  have,  management  does not
expect the  adoption of this  standard  will have a material  impact on the at&amp;t;
wireless group's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

in june 2000, the fasb issued sfas no. 138,  "accounting for certain  derivative
instruments  and certain  hedging  activities"  as an amendment to sfas no. 133.
this  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
issues  under sfas no. 133 on  specific  types of hedges.  based on the types of
contracts we currently have, management does not expect this statement to have a
material impact on the at&amp;t; wireless  group's  results of operations,  financial
position or cash flows.

subsequent events

on november  13,  2000,  telecorp  pcs,  inc.  (telecorp)  completed  its merger
agreement  with tritel,  inc., as part of a stock  transaction.  pursuant to the
terms of the  agreement,  each  company  merged  with a  separate  newly  formed
subsidiary of a new holding company named telecorp pcs, inc., upon  consummation
of the  transaction.  prior to the merger,  the at&amp;t; wireless  group held equity
interests in each of telecorp and tritel which were both  affiliates of the at&amp;t;
wireless  group.  in  connection  with  the  merger,  the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group
contributed  to  telecorp  pcs,  inc.,  rights to  acquire  additional  wireless
licenses  in  wisconsin  and iowa,  paid  approximately  $20 million in cash and
extended the term of its brand license  agreement through july 2005, in exchange
for approximately 9.3 million common shares in the newly combined company.  this
transaction  will bring the at&amp;t; wireless  group's  equity stake in the combined
company  to  approximately   23%,  assuming  the  conversion  of  all  currently
convertible  preferred  stock to common stock.  in a separate  transaction  with
telecorp,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  completed an exchange of certain  wireless
licenses and rights to acquire  licenses in the wisconsin  and iowa markets,  as
well as made a cash payment of approximately  $80 million.  in return,  the at&amp;t;
wireless group received  telecorp's pcs licenses and wireless systems in several
new england  markets.  the at&amp;t; wireless  group  anticipates it will recognize a
significant gain on the transactions.

on october 25, 2000,  at&amp;t;  announced  its intention to dispose of its remaining
interest in the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking  stock,  which has been approved by
at&amp;t;'s board of  directors.  at&amp;t; intends to offer at&amp;t; common  shareowners  the
opportunity  to exchange  at&amp;t; common  stock for at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracking
stock.  at&amp;t; plans to  distribute  its  remaining  interest in the at&amp;t; wireless
group tracking stock to at&amp;t; common  shareowners in 2001. upon completion of the
exchange offer and distribution, at&amp;t; intends to convert the at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock into an asset-based  at&amp;t; wireless common stock and distribute to
its shareowners.

on october 2, 2000, the at&amp;t; wireless group completed its acquisition of several
equity interests in international  ventures  acquired by at&amp;t; as a result of its
acquisition  of mediaone in june 2000.  the at&amp;t; wireless  group  acquired these
interests from at&amp;t; for  approximately  $1 billion in cash, which was determined
based  upon a third  party  valuation.  additionally,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group
assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling  approximately $220 million which were
transferred from at&amp;t.;

on october 2, 2000,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  completed its  acquisition  of a
wireless  system in  indianapolis  for  approximately  $530 million in cash. the
transaction was recorded under the purchase method of accounting.
