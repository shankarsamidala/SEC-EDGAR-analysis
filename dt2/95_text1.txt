                  ames department stores, inc. and subsidiaries
              notes to consolidated condensed financial statements

                                   (unaudited)


1.       basis of presentation :

     in the  opinion of  management,  the  accompanying  unaudited  consolidated
condensed  financial  statements  of ames  department  stores,  inc. (a delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries (collectively "ames" or the "company") contain all
adjustments  (consisting of normal recurring  adjustments)  necessary for a fair
presentation of such financial  statements for the interim  periods.  due to the
seasonality of the company's  operations,  the results of its operations for the
interim  period ended april 29, 2000 may not be  indicative of total results for
the full year. certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial  statements  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted  pursuant to the rules and regulations
promulgated by the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"). certain prior
year amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the presentation used for the
current  year.  pursuant to the  indenture  governing  the ames senior notes (as
defined  in note 5),  all of  ames'  subsidiaries  have  jointly  and  severally
guaranteed  the ames senior notes on a full and  unconditional  basis.  separate
financial statements of those subsidiaries have not been included herein because
management  has  determined  that  they  are  not  material  to  investors.

     the consolidated  condensed  balance sheet at january 29, 2000 was obtained
from audited financial statements previously filed with the sec in the company's
annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2000 (the "1999
form  10-k").  the  accompanying   unaudited  consolidated  condensed  financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included in the 1999 form 10-k.

     in the fourth  quarter of the year ended january 29, 2000 ("fiscal  1999"),
the  company  adopted  staff  accounting   bulletin  ("sab")  no.  101  "revenue
recognition" as promulgated by the staff of the sec effective  retroactively  to
the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1999.  therefore,  the  consolidated  condensed
financial statements for the thirteen weeks ended may 1, 1999 have been adjusted
accordingly.  reference  can be  made  to the  1999  form  10-k  for  additional
discussion of the adoption of sab no. 101 by the company.

2.       acquisition and agency agreement:

     acquisition of hills stores company

     on december  31,  1998,  hsc  acquisition  corp.  ("hsc"),  a wholly  owned
subsidiary of the company,  acquired in excess of 80% of the outstanding  voting
stock of hills stores company ("hills") and approximately 74% of the outstanding
hills 12.5% senior notes.  subsequently,  hills was merged with hsc and became a
wholly owned subsidiary of ames department stores, inc. in april 1999, hills was
merged with and into ames  department  stores,  inc.  the  acquisition  has been
recorded under the purchase method of accounting.

     total cash  consideration  for the  acquisition  of hills was $129 million.
reference can be made to the 1999 form 10-k for further  discussion of the hills
acquisition.

     at the time of the  acquisition  hills  operated  155  discount  department
stores. during 1999, the company remodeled and converted 151 of the hills stores
to ames  stores.  the four  remaining  hills  stores along with seven other ames
stores were closed,  because they were in locations that were either competitive
with or were  under-performing  other hills or ames stores.  the  remodeling and
conversion  process  was  conducted  in  three  stages,   each  stage  involving
approximately  one third of the hills  stores.  the first stage was completed in
late april 1999; the second stage was completed in late july 1999; and the third
stage was completed in late september 1999.

     concurrent  with  the  hills  acquisition,   the  company  entered  into  a
transition and agency  agreement (the "agency  agreement")  with gordon brothers
retail partners, llc and the nassi group, llc (collectively the "agent"),  which
provided  that the  agent  serve  for a  period  of time to  operate  all of the
acquired  hills  stores and to conduct  inventory  liquidation  sales at each of
those stores prior to its scheduled  remodeling or final  closure.  accordingly,
the agent managed the sale of the inventory acquired in the hills acquisition as
well as certain other inventory  identified in the agency agreement.  the agency
agreement  entitled  the company to receive  out of the sale  proceeds a minimum
amount equal to 40% of the initial retail value or ticketed selling price of the
merchandise (the "guaranteed return"),  with the possibility of a greater return
if the sale proceeds exceeded a target percentage of initial retail value.
&gt;

     the results of operations of hills for the thirteen weeks ended may 1, 1999
have  been  included  in  the  accompanying   consolidated  condensed  financial
statements.  during  the  thirteen  weeks  ended  may  1,  1999,  the  following
accounting  treatment  has been  applied to  recognize  the results of the hills
stores prior to their  conversion to ames stores  during fiscal 1999.  hills net
sales have been recorded as "hills net sales" and  represent net sales  achieved
by the hills stores  prior to their  conversion  to ames stores.  "hills cost of
merchandise sold" represents the cost of merchandise sold in connection with the
above referenced sales as adjusted for the guaranteed  return.  "hills operating
expenses and agency fees" include the following:  the associated  store expenses
incurred  while  operating  the hills stores prior to their  conversion  to ames
stores,  which are  reimbursable  to the  company  out of the  proceeds of hills
merchandise sales per the agency agreement;  the agency fee due to the agent for
the period  presented;  and other expenses (e.g.  non-store  payroll,  non-store
rent,  etc.)  associated  with  supporting  the  hills  stores  prior  to  their
conversion  to  ames  stores,  which  are  not  reimbursable  under  the  agency
agreement.

     acquisition of goldblatt's leases

     in april 2000, the company consummated its purchase of the leases for seven
stores from  goldblatt's  department  stores,  inc. for a cash purchase price of
$7.6 million.

     reference  can  be  made  to the  fiscal  1999  form  10-k  for  additional
discussion of the hills and goldblatt's acquisitions.

3.       net income (loss) per common share:

     net  income  (loss) per share was  determined  using the  weighted  average
number of common  shares  outstanding.  diluted  net loss per share was equal to
basic net loss per share  because  inclusion of common stock  equivalents  would
have been  anti-dilutive.  during the  quarter  ended  april 29,  2000,  139,382
options were exercised and 100,000 series b warrants were converted.  during the
quarter ended may 1, 1999,  103,981  options were exercised and no warrants were
converted.

4.       inventories:

     inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in,  first-out
(fifo) method, or market and include the  capitalization  of transportation  and
distribution center costs.

5.       debt:

     credit agreement

     on december 31, 1998, in connection with the acquisition of hills,  certain
of the company's subsidiaries entered into an agreement (the "credit agreement")
with a syndicate of banks and  financial  institutions  for whom bank of america
nt&amp;sa; is serving as agent. the credit agreement provides for a secured revolving
credit facility of up to $650 million.

     the credit  agreement  is in effect  until june 30,  2002 and is secured by
substantially  all of the assets of the  company.  reference  can be made to the
1999  form  10-k for  additional  discussion  of the  credit  agreement  and for
descriptions of the company's other obligations not discussed herein.

     as of april 29, 2000,  borrowings of $429.3 million were outstanding  under
the credit  agreement.  these  borrowings  are included in long-term debt in the
accompanying  consolidated  condensed  balance  sheet as of april 29,  2000.  in
addition,  $21.5 and $4.2  million  of  standby  and trade  letters  of  credit,
respectively,  were outstanding under the credit agreement. the weighted average
interest rate on the  borrowings for the thirteen weeks ended april 29, 2000 was
7.8%.  the peak  borrowing  level through april 29, 2000 was $429.3  million and
occurred in april 2000.

     senior notes due 2006

     on april 27, 1999,  the company  completed  the sale of $200 million of its
10% seven-year senior notes (the "ames senior notes"). the net proceeds from the
sale of the ames senior notes, approximately $193.4 million, were used to reduce
outstanding  borrowings  under the credit  agreement.  the ames senior notes pay
interest semi-annually in april and october and mature april 2006.


     senior notes due 2003

     the 12.5% senior notes due 2003 (the "hills  senior  notes")  were,  at the
time of the acquisition of hills, an unsecured obligation of hills.

     the hills  senior  notes pay  interest  in january and june and mature july
2003.  during the quarter  ended april 29, 2000 the company  repurchased  on the
open market approximately $2.7 million face value of these notes.

     reference  can  be  made  to the  fiscal  1999  form  10-k  for  additional
discussion of the ames senior notes and hills senior notes.

6.       stock options:

     the company has three stock  option plans (the  "option  plans"):  the 1994
management  stock  option  plan,  the  1998  stock  incentive  plan and the 1994
non-employee directors stock option plan.

     in october 1995,  the financial  accounting  standard board issued sfas no.
123  "accounting  for stock  based  compensation."  sfas no. 123  established  a
fair-value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation;  however, it
allowed  entities to continue  accounting for employee stock based  compensation
under the  intrinsic  value method  prescribed by  accounting  principles  board
opinion no. 25,  "accounting for stock issued to employees." the company elected
to account  for the option  plans  under apb  opinion  no.  25,  under  which no
compensation cost has been recognized and adopt sfas no. 123 through disclosure.

     if the company had elected to  recognize  compensation  cost for the option
plans based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards  under those  plans,
consistent  with the method  prescribed  by sfas no. 123, net loss and basic net
loss per common share would have  approximated  the pro forma amounts  indicated
below:

     the fair value of stock  options  used to compute  pro forma net income and
net income per diluted  common share is the  estimated  present  value as of the
grant  date using the  black-scholes  option-pricing  model  with the  following
weighted average assumptions: no dividend yield, expected option volatilities, a
risk-free interest rate equal to u.s. treasury  securities with a maturity equal
to the expected life of the option and an expected life from date of grant until
option expiration date.

7.       income taxes:

     the company's  estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year was
applied to the loss before  income taxes for the thirteen  weeks ended april 29,
2000 and may 1, 1999 to compute a non-cash  income tax  benefit.  the income tax
benefit is included in other  current  assets in the  accompanying  consolidated
condensed balance sheet as of april 29, 2000 and may 1, 1999.

8.       commitments and contingencies:

     reference  can be made to the 1999 form 10-k  (item 3 - legal  proceedings)
for various litigation  involving the company,  for which there were no material
changes since the filing date of the 1999 form 10-k.


9.       recently issued accounting pronouncements:

     in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standard board issued statement of
financial  accounting  standards  (sfas) no.  133,  "accounting  for  derivative
instruments and hedging activities." this statement  establishes  accounting and
reporting  standards  requiring  that  every  derivative  instrument  (including
certain derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the
balance  sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at its fair value.  the
statement also requires that changes in a derivative's  fair value be recognized
currently in earnings  unless specific hedge  accounting  criteria are met. sfas
no. 133 is effective, prospectively, for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning  after june 15,  2000,  with early  adoption at the  beginning  of any
fiscal quarter being permitted.  management is currently analyzing the impact of
this new  pronouncement  on the  company's  financial  position  and  results of
operations.




item 2.
                     management's discussion and analysis of
                  financial condition and results of operations



     the following  discussion and analysis  should be read in conjunction  with
the  consolidated  condensed  financial  statements and notes  presented in this
report.

results of operations

     the  consolidated  results of operations  for the quarter ended may 1, 1999
include  the  results of the former  hills  stores  during the period  they were
operated by gordon brothers and the nassi group under an agency agreement. these
firms were  engaged to operate  the hills  stores  until  their  closure  and to
liquidate the merchandise inventories.

     during the quarter ended may 1, 1999,  gordon  brothers and the nassi group
completed the  merchandise  liquidation  sales in 52 of the former hills stores.
subsequent to the liquidation  sales,  the company  remodeled 50 of these stores
during an eight-week  period and, on april 19, 1999,  the company  re-opened the
remodeled  stores as ames  stores.  in addition,  gordon  brothers and the nassi
group  initiated the  liquidation  sales in 55 former hills stores in late march
and the final liquidation sales in 48 former hills stores in early may.

     the following  table  illustrates  the results of ames'  operations for the
quarter ended april 29, 2000, as compared to the separate contributions of ames'
and hills'  operations and the other costs described  below to the  consolidated
results of operations for the quarter ended may 1, 1999.

     the ames column  represents (a) the results of the ames store base, (b) the
results of the converted hills stores after their  re-opening as ames stores and
(c)  certain  expenses  associated  with the  acquisition  of  hills,  including
interest  expense on the acquired hills senior notes and a pro rata share of the
amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition.

     the hills column  represents  (a) the results of  operations  for the hills
stores during the period that these stores were operated  pursuant to the gordon
brothers/nassi  agency  agreement,  including  depreciation and interest expense
directly  associated with such stores and (b) hills corporate overhead expenses,
principally the canton, ma facility.

     the other  column  represents  the expenses  incurred  during the period of
remodeling the hills stores (for example,  pre-opening  expenses incurred during
the conversion or "dark" period) as well as certain other expenses.

     the unique  circumstances  under which  hills'  operations  were  conducted
through  the quarter  ended may 1, 1999  distort  any direct  comparison  of the
principal  components of ames' consolidated results for the quarters ended april
29, 2000 and may 1, 1999. in the discussion that follows, ames' net sales, gross
margin, and selling,  general and administrative  expenses for the quarter ended
april 29, 2000 are  compared to the ames'  results for the quarter  ended may 1,
1999,  exclusive of the hills  results and other  expenses.  the  comparison  of
depreciation and amortization expense and interest and debt expense will be on a
consolidated basis.

     ames' net sales  increased  $263.4  million or 46% in the first  quarter of
2000  compared to the prior year's first  quarter.  this increase is primarily a
result of the  inclusion  of all 151 of the  converted  hills stores in the ames
store  base for the  entire  quarter  compared  to only 51 stores  for two weeks
during the quarter  ended may 1, 1999.  comparable  store sales  increased  1.2%
during the first quarter.

     gross margin  increased  $69.8  million or 44% in the first quarter of 2000
from the first quarter of 1999. the increase is a result of the increased number
of ames stores, as previously  discussed.  gross margin as a percentage of sales
declined  slightly  from 27.8% to 27.4%.  the  decrease was mainly the result of
slightly higher markdowns and changes in merchandise mix.

     selling, general and administrative expenses increased $87.8 million or 55%
as a result of the expanded  ames store base.  expenses as a percentage of sales
increased  from 27.8% to 29.5%  primarily as a result of sales  falling short of
planned levels.

     depreciation  and amortization  expense  increased $3.3 million or 23%. the
increase  resulted  primarily from a full quarter of additional  depreciation on
the  remodeling  expenditures  associated  with  conversion  of the former hills
stores.

     interest  expense  increased  $6.9  million or 58%.  the increase is mainly
attributed to a higher level of borrowings  under our revolving  credit facility
as well as a full quarter's interest expense for the ames senior notes issued in
april of 1999.

     our estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year was applied to
the loss before  income  taxes for each period to compute a non-cash  income tax
benefit.  the income tax benefits are included in current  assets in the balance
sheet as of april 29, 2000 and may 1, 1999.

liquidity and capital resources

     our principal sources of liquidity are our revolving credit facility,  cash
from operations and cash on hand. our revolving credit  facility,  which expires
june 20,  2002,  provides  credit of up to $650  million.  borrowings  under the
revolving  credit facility are secured by  substantially  all of our assets.  in
addition,   we  are  required  to  meet  certain  financial   covenants  if  our
availability under the credit facility falls below a specified level. during the
first  quarter we increased  our drawings on the credit  facility  approximately
$254.8 million but our  availability did not fall below the specified level. our
peak borrowing  level under the facility during the quarter ended april 29, 2000
was $429.3  million.  we believe we will have  sufficient  liquidity to meet our
financial obligations for the foreseeable future.

     merchandise  inventories increased $156.5 million from january 29, 2000 due
primarily  to an  unexpected  sales  shortfall  during the first  quarter  and a
seasonal merchandise build up. merchandise  inventories increased $285.6 million
from may 1, 1999  primarily as a result of fully  stocking the  converted  hills
stores and changing  inventory  valuation in  approximately  two-thirds of those
stores from liquidation value to cost.


     trade accounts payable decreased  approximately $7 million from january 29,
2000 primarily as a result of a slowdown in merchandise purchases in response to
the first  quarter sales  shortfall.  trade  accounts  payable  increased  $63.2
million  from  may 1,  1999  due  to the  increase  in  merchandise  inventories
referenced above.

     capital  expenditures  for the thirteen  weeks ended april 29, 2000 totaled
$40.2 million and for the balance of the year are estimated to be  approximately
$80.0 million. we adjust our plans for making such expenditures depending on the
amount of internally generated funds.

     net fixed assets  increased  $19.7 million from january 29, 2000  primarily
due to  $40.2  million  in  capital  expenditures  offset  by $19.7  million  in
depreciation expense.

     in april 2000, the company consummated its purchase of the leases for seven
stores from  goldblatt's  department  stores,  inc. for a cash purchase price of
$7.6 million.  six of the stores are located in chicago,  illinois and one is in
gary, indiana.

     beneficial  lease rights  represent  the excess of the fair market value of
the acquired hills leases over contract value of those leases. we are amortizing
this amount over the terms of the related leases (which average approximately 25
years) using the straight-line method. goodwill is being amortized over 25 years
using the straight-line method.

     long-term debt as of april 29, 2000 consisted of borrowings  under our bank
credit  facility of $429.3  million,  $200.0  million of the ames  senior  notes
issued in april 1999 and $44.5  million of the hills senior notes that  remained
outstanding  after  the  acquisition.  the  hills  senior  notes  became  direct
obligations of ames as a result of the merger of hills into ames.

     capital lease and financing obligations decreased $4.4 million from january
29,  2000 to april 29, 2000 due  primarily  to  payments  made on capital  lease
obligations. capital lease and financing obligations decreased $4.6 million from
may 1, 1999 to april 29, 2000 primarily as result of payments slightly exceeding
new capital lease commitments.

     the net operating loss carryovers  remaining after fiscal 1999,  subject to
any limitations  pursuant to internal revenue code sec 382, should offset income
on which taxes would otherwise be payable in the next several years.

note concerning forward-looking statements

     statements,  other than  those  based on  historical  facts  which  address
activities,  events, or developments that the company expects or anticipates may
occur in the future are forward-looking statements which are based upon a number
of assumptions  concerning  further  conditions that may ultimately  prove to be
inaccurate.  actual events and results may  materially  differ from  anticipated
results described in any  forward-looking  statements.  the company's ability to
achieve   such   results  is  subject  to  certain   risks  and   uncertainties.
consequently,  these cautionary  statements  qualify all of the  forward-looking
statements  and there  can be no  assurance  that the  results  or  developments
anticipated  by the company will be realized or that they will have the expected
effects on the company or its business or operations.

item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we have exposure to interest rate volatility primarily relating to interest
rate changes applicable to revolving loans under our bank credit facility. these
loans bear interest at rates which vary with changes in (i) the london interbank
offered  rate (libor) or (ii) a rate of interest  announced  publicly by bank of
america nt &amp; sa.

     we do not speculate on the future  direction of interest rates. as of april
29, 2000,  approximately  $429.3  million of our debt bore  interest at variable
rates.  we believe that the effect,  if any, of  reasonably  possible  near-term
changes in interest rates on our  consolidated  financial  position,  results of
operations or cash flows would not be significant.

     for the purpose of  calculating  the ratio of  earnings  to fixed  charges,
earnings  consist  of  income  before  income  taxes,   extraordinary  item  and
cumulative effect  adjustment plus fixed charges (net of capitalized  interest).
fixed charges consist of interest  expense on all  indebtedness  and capitalized
interest,  amortized  premiums,  discounts and capitalized  expenses  related to
indebtedness,  and  one-third of rent expense on operating  leases  representing
that portion of rent expense deemed by us to be  attributable  to interest.  for
the quarter ended april 29, 2000 and the fiscal year ended january 29, 2000, the
amount of  additional  earnings  that would have been  required  to cover  fixed
charges for these periods was $46.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively.
