<font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman">forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the company’s
actual results to differ materially from the company’s
expectations.  the following factors, in addition to other possible
factors not listed, could cause the company’s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:  the
materially weakened financial condition of the company, resulting from its
significant losses in recent years; weaker demand for air travel and lower
investment asset returns resulting from the severe global economic downturn; the
company’s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on
acceptable terms; the ability of the company to generate additional revenues and
reduce its costs; continued high and volatile fuel prices and further increases
in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel; the company’s substantial
indebtedness and other obligations; the ability of the company to satisfy
existing financial or other covenants in certain of its credit agreements;
changes in economic and other conditions beyond the company’s control, and the
volatile results of the company’s operations; the fiercely and increasingly
competitive business environment faced by the company; potential industry
consolidation and alliance changes; competition with reorganized carriers; low
fare levels by historical standards and the company’s reduced pricing power;
changes in the company’s corporate or business strategy; government regulation
of the company’s business; conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks;
uncertainties with respect to the company’s international operations; outbreaks
of a disease (such as sars or avian flu) that affects travel behavior; labor
costs that are higher than those of the company’s competitors; uncertainties
with respect to the company’s relationships with unionized and other employee
work groups; increased insurance costs and potential reductions of available
insurance coverage; the company’s ability to retain key management personnel;
potential failures or disruptions of the company’s computer, communications or
other technology systems; losses and adverse publicity resulting from any
accident involving the company’s aircraft; changes in the price of the company’s
common stock; and the ability of the company to reach acceptable agreements with
third parties.  additional information concerning these and other
factors is contained in the company’s securities and exchange commission
filings, including but not limited to the company’s 2008 form 10-k (see in
particular item 1a “risk factors” in the 2008 form 10-k).</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman"><font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">the company’s ability to
return to profitability and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on
an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely
beyond the company’s control.  </font>certain risk factors that affect
the company’s business and financial results are discussed in the risk factors
listed in item 1a in the 2008 form 10-k.  in addition, most of the
company’s largest domestic competitors and several smaller carriers have filed
for bankruptcy in the last several years and have used this process to
significantly reduce contractual labor and other costs.  in order to
remain competitive and to improve its financial condition, the company must
continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce its
costs.  although the company has a number of initiatives underway to
address its cost and revenue challenges, the adequacy and ultimate success of
these and other initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be
assured.  it will be very difficult for the company to continue to
fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the
overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially and if fuel
prices were to increase and persist for an extended period at high
levels.</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman"><font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">the company remains

funding obligations), as described more fully under item 7, “management’s

2008 form 10-k.  </font>indebtedness is a significant risk to the
company as discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a in the 2008 form
10-k.  during 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the company raised an
aggregate of approximately $2.5 billion in financing to fund capital commitments
(mainly for aircraft and ground properties), debt maturities, and employee
pension obligations, and to bolster its liquidity.  <font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">as of the date of this

obligations.  h<font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">owever, to maintain
