internet advertising market; and (3) funding sources for internet-based consumer
businesses,  which require  considerable  amounts of capital,  had substantially
evaporated  as of december 31, 2000.  as a result,  excite@home  concluded  that
fundamental,  permanent and significant  adverse changes had occurred during the
fourth quarter of 2000 in the business climate for companies  providing internet
advertising and other web-based services.

         in addition,  excite@home  reviewed operating and cash flow projections
that existed at the time excite@home made the acquisitions and that were used as
a basis upon which the decisions to complete the  acquisitions  were made. these
operating and cash flow projections indicated that the acquired companies,  over
their useful lives,  would be profitable and generate  positive cash flows.  the
operating and cash flow projections were compared to operating results after the
date of the  acquisitions  through  december 31,  2000,  as well as to projected
operating   results  for  2001.   these   comparisons   indicated  that  certain
acquisitions  generated  operating and cash flow losses through the end of 2000,
and were projected to continue generating operating and cash flow losses for the
foreseeable future.

         as  a  result  of  these  factors,   excite@home  determined  that  the
intangible  assets  related to the  acquisitions  might not be  recoverable  and
conducted impairment tests.

         generally,  the impairment tests were performed at an asset group level
corresponding  to the  lowest  level at which cash  flows  independent  of other
assets  could be  identified.  each asset group  consisted  of the  goodwill and
acquired  identifiable  intangible  assets  related to a  specific  acquisition.
acquired intangible assets were combined for those acquisitions where separately
identifiable cash flows that are largely  independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets could not be identified.

         for each of the asset groups to be tested for  impairment,  excite@home
projected undiscounted cash flows over a future projection period of five years,
based on excite@home's  determination  of the current  remaining useful lives of
the asset  groups,  plus an  undiscounted  terminal  period cash flow to reflect
disposition  of the  entities  at the end of their  useful  lives.  undiscounted
future cash flows were estimated using projected net realizable value in a sales
transaction  (undiscounted  cash flows  during the  expected  remaining  holding
period until disposition were estimated as negligible).  the undiscounted future
cash flows were  compared  to the  carrying  amount of each asset  group and for
those asset groups where the carrying  amount exceeded the  undiscounted  future
cash flows, excite@home concluded that the asset group was impaired.

         excite@home  measured the  impairment  loss  related to impaired  asset
groups  based on the  amount by which  the  carrying  amount of the asset  group
exceeded the fair value of the asset group.  measurement of fair value was based
on an analysis by excite@home  utilizing the best  information  available in the
circumstances using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections,  and
including the discounted cash flow and market comparison  valuation  techniques.
the discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes
and was based on  excite@home's  best  estimate of projected  future cash flows,
including  terminal value cash flows expected to result from the  disposition of
the asset at the end of its useful life, discounted at our weighted average cost
of  capital.  weighted  average  cost of capital  was based on  historical  risk
premiums required by investors for companies of excite@home's size, industry and
capital structure and included risk factors specific to excite@home.  the market
comparison model represented  excite@home's  estimate of the prices that a buyer
would be  willing to pay  currently  for  similar  assets,  based on  comparable
products and services,  customer base,  risks,  earnings  capabilities and other
factors.
<page>

         based on the foregoing,  excite@home recorded an impairment  write-down
of $4,609 in the  aggregate,  which was allocated to each asset group based on a
comparison of carrying values and fair values. the impairment  write-down within
each asset group was allocated first to goodwill, and if goodwill was reduced to
zero, to identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.

         also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  at&amp;t;  recorded  a  goodwill  and
acquistion-related  impairment  charge  associated  with the  acquisition of our
investment in  excite@home.  the  write-down of our investment to fair value was
determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.

         since  we own  approximately  23%  of  excite@home,  77% of the  charge
recorded by  excite@home  was not  included as a reduction to at&amp;t;'s net income,
but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  consolidated  statement  of income as
"minority interest income (expense)."

         the $759 charge for  restructuring  and exit plans was primarily due to
headcount  reductions,  mainly in  network  operations  and  business  services,
including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
synergies created by the mediaone merger.

         included in exit costs was $503 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  approximately
6,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.

         we also  recorded $62 of network lease and other  contract  termination
costs  associated  with penalties  incurred as part of notifying  vendors of the
termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of $32 related to
the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergies created by the mediaone
merger.

         the  following   table  displays  the  activity  and  balances  of  the
restructuring reserve account:

         deductions reflect cash payments of $245, $209 and $369, for 1998, 1999
and 2000,  respectively.  these payments  included cash termination  benefits of
$124, $40 and $257, respectively,  which were primarily funded through cash from

<page>

operations.  deductions also reflect  noncash  utilization of $420, $43 and $170
for 1998, 1999 and 2000,  respectively.  noncash  utilization  included deferred
severance  payments  primarily related to executives,  and a reversal in 1998 of
$348  related  to the  1995  restructuring  plan.  nearly  75% of the  employees
affected by the 1999 and 2000 restructuring charges have left their positions as
of december 31, 2000.

         also  included  in  restructuring  and  exit  costs in 2000 was $144 of
benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part of
these exit plans. further, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related
to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  businesses  where the
carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.

         during 1999, we recorded $1,506 of net restructuring and other charges.

         a  $594  in-process   research  and  development  charge  was  recorded
reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at tci,
as of  the  date  of  acquisition,  which  had  not  yet  reached  technological
feasibility or had no alternative future use. the projects identified related to
efforts to offer voice over internet protocol (ip),  product-integration efforts
for advanced  set-top devices that would enable the offering of  next-generation
digital    services   and   cost-savings    efforts   for    broadband-telephony
implementation.  in addition,  excite@home had research and development  efforts
underway,  including projects to allow for  self-provisioning of devices and the
development  of  next-generation   client  software,   network  and  back-office
infrastructure to enable a variety of network devices beyond personal computers,
and improved  design for the regional  data  centers'  infrastructure.  we began
testing  ip-telephony  equipment  in  the  field  in  late-2000,  we  anticipate
beginning field trials for  next-generation  digital services in late-2001,  and
have   completed   trials   related  to  our  telephony   cost   reductions  and
implementation  has begun in certain markets.  although there are  technological
issues to overcome to successfully complete the acquired in-process research and
development,  we expect successful  completion.  if, however,  at&amp;t; is unable to
establish   technological    feasibility   and   produce   commercially   viable
products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.

         a $531 asset impairment charge was recorded in 1999 associated with the
planned disposal of certain wireless  communications  equipment resulting from a
program to increase  the  capacity  and  operating  efficiency  of our  wireless
network.  as part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
equipment in the western  united states and the  metropolitan  new york markets.
the program is intended to provide wireless  services with the newest technology
available  and allow it to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities.

         the planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure  equipment
required an  evaluation of asset  impairment in accordance  with sfas no. 121 to
write-down these assets to their fair value,  which was estimated by discounting
the  expected  future cash flows of these  assets  through the date of disposal.
since the assets will remain in service from the date of the decision to dispose
of these assets to the disposal date, the remaining net book value of the assets
will be  depreciated  over this period.  as of december 31, 2000,  approximately
$320 of the asset impairment reserve has been utilized for assets that have been
disposed of and written  off. the  remaining  net book value of these assets was
approximately  $23 at  december  31,  2000,  which will be  depreciated  over an
estimated remaining useful life of three months.

         also in 1999,  a $145  charge  for  restructuring  and exit  costs  was
recorded as part of at&amp;t;'s  initiative to reduce costs.  the  restructuring  and
exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
reductions  in  business   services  and  network   operations,   including  the
consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

         included in exit costs was $142 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  approximately
1,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.

         we also recorded net losses of $307 related to the  government-mandated
disposition  of  certain  international  businesses  that  would  have  competed
directly with concert,  and $50 related to a  contribution  agreement  broadband
entered into with phoenixstar, inc. that agreement requires broadband to satisfy
certain  liabilities owed by phoenixstar and its subsidiaries.  in addition,  we
recorded  benefits of $121 related to the settlement of pension  obligations for
former employees who accepted at&amp;t;'s 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program
(vrip) offer.

         during 1998, we recorded $2,514 of net restructuring and other charges.
the bulk of the charge was associated  with our overall  cost-reduction  program
and the approximately 15,300 management employees who accepted the vrip offer. a
restructuring  charge of $2,724 was  composed of $2,254 and $169 for pension and
postretirement  special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 of benefit plan
curtailment  losses  and $38 of other  administrative  costs.  we also  recorded
charges of $125 for  related  facility  costs and $150 for  executive-separation
costs.  these  charges were  partially  offset by benefits of $940 as we settled
pension benefit obligations of 13,700 of the total vrip employees.  in addition,
the vrip charges were partially  offset by the reversal of $256 of 1995 business
restructuring  reserves primarily  resulting from the overlap of vrip on certain
1995 projects.

         also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718,  of which  $633 was  related  to our
decision not to pursue total service resale (tsr) as a  local-service  strategy.
we also recorded an $85 asset  impairment  charge  related to the  write-down of
unrecoverable  assets in certain  international  operations  where the  carrying
value was no longer  supported  by future  cash  flows.  this charge was made in
connection  with the review of  certain  operations  that  would  have  competed
directly with concert.

         additionally,  $85 of  merger-related  expenses was recorded in 1998 in
connection  with  the tcg  merger,  which  was  accounted  for as a  pooling  of
interests.  partially  offsetting  these  charges was a $92 reversal of the 1995
restructuring  reserve.  this  reversal  reflected  reserves  no  longer  deemed
necessary.  the reversal  primarily  included  separation  costs  attributed  to
projects completed at a cost lower than originally anticipated.  consistent with
the  three-year  plan, the 1995  restructuring  initiatives  were  substantially
completed by the end of 1998.

         during 2000 and 1999,  certain  investees of liberty media group issued
common  stock.  changes in the equity of the  investees,  net of the dilution of
lmg's ownership  interest,  resulted in an increase to at&amp;t;'s additional paid-in
capital of $355 and $109 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

9.  other investments

         we have  investments  in various  companies and  partnerships  that are
accounted for under the equity method and included within "other investments and
related  advances" in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets.  under the
equity  method,  investments  are stated at initial  cost,  and are adjusted for
subsequent contributions and our share of earnings, losses and distributions. at
december  31,  2000 and 1999,  we had  equity  investments  (other  than lmg) of
$13,624 and  $18,454,  respectively.  the  carrying  value of these  investments
exceeded our share of the underlying reported net assets by approximately $8,720
and $12,530, at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  the goodwill is being
amortized  over periods  ranging  from 15 to 40 years.  pretax  amortization  of
goodwill was $571,  $495,  and $52 in 2000,  1999, and 1998,  respectively.  the
amortization  is shown net of income  taxes as a  component  of "net losses from
other equity investments" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
distributions from equity investments totaled $214, $317 and $360, for the years
ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(a)      at  december  31,  2000  and  1999,  we  owned  48,942,172   shares  of
         cablevision  systems  corporation  class a common  stock,  which  had a
         closing market price of $84.94 and $75.50 per share,  respectively,  on
         those dates. cablevision systems corporation (cablevision) redeemed all
         of its outstanding  preferred stock and issued additional common stock,
         and issued shares of its common stock for acquisitions.  as a result of
         these transactions,  at&amp;t;'s ownership interest in cablevision decreased
         from 32.04% to 27.98%. due to the dilution of at&amp;t;'s ownership interest
         in  cablevision,  net of the  increase in  cablevision's  equity,  at&amp;t;
         recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of $170 in 2000.

(b)      on january 5, 2000, we formed concert, our  global-communications joint
         venture with bt.

(c)      at december 31, 2000, we owned  18,900,000  shares of  net2phone,  inc.
         class a common  stock,  which had a closing  market  price of $7.38 per
         share on that date.

(d)      this investment is accounted for under the equity method because of our
         ability  to elect  certain  members of the board of  directors  of this
         entity, which we believe provides us with significant influence.

(e)      on december 29,  2000,  ab cellular  completed  the  redemption  of our
         equity interest in ab cellular.  voting interest in ab cellular was 50%
         at december 31, 1999.

(f)      on  august 28,  2000,  at&amp;t; and  excite@home  announced  the closing of
         their extension contracts and governance reorganization. as a result of
         the governance  changes,  at&amp;t; gained a controlling  interest and began
         consolidating  excite@home's  results  on  september  1,  2000.  as  of
         december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
         74% voting interest in  excite@home.  we owned 7,924,422 and 63,720,000

<page>

         shares of  excite@home  class a common  stock at december  31, 2000 and
         1999, respectively, which had closing market prices of $5.53 and $42.88
         per share,  respectively,  on those dates. we also owned 86,595,578 and
         30,800,000  shares of excite@home  class b common stock at december 31,
         2000 and 1999, respectively, which are not publicly traded. during 2000
         and 1999,  excite@home  issued  shares of its common  stock for various

         in february  2000,  we entered into a 364-day,  $10 billion  syndicated
credit facility upon the expiration of existing credit  facilities.  on december
28, 2000, we entered into a new 364-day,  $25 billion credit facility syndicated
to 39 banks.  as a result,  the  outstanding  $10 billion  credit  facility  was
terminated.  the credit facility is for commercial  paper back-up and was unused
at  december  31,  2000.  the credit  facility  agreement  contains a  financial
covenant that requires at&amp;t; to maintain a net  debt-to-ebitda  ratio (as defined
in the  credit  agreement)  not  exceeding  3.00 to 1.00  for  four  consecutive
quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter. at december 31, 2000, we
were in compliance with this covenant.

         at december 31,  1999,  we had a 364-day,  $7 billion  revolving-credit
facility  with a  consortium  of 42  lenders.  we also had  additional  364-day,

         excess of the fair value over the recorded  value of debt in connection
         with the tci and mediaone mergers at december 31, 2000 and december 31,
         1999,  respectively.  the excess is being  amortized over the remaining
         lives of the underlying debt obligations.

(b)      the actual interest paid on our debt obligations may have differed from
         the stated amount due to our entering into interest rate swap contracts
         to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and our strategy to reduce
         finance costs (see note 12).

march 26,  1999,  at&amp;t; issued $8 billion in notes.  we received  net proceeds of
approximately  $7.9  billion  from  the sale of the  notes.  the  proceeds  were
utilized to repay  commercial paper issued in connection with the tci merger and
toward  funding the share  repurchase  program.  on  september  14,  1999,  at&amp;t;
completed  a $450  bond  offering  in  connection  with  the  same  registration

         at maturity, the exchangeable notes will be redeemed, at at&amp;t;'s option,
with (i) a number of shares of  comcast  common  stock  equal to the  underlying
shares  multiplied by the exchange ratio, or (ii) its equivalent cash value. the
exchange ratio will be calculated at maturity in the following manner:

         (a)      if the fair market value of a share of comcast common stock is
                  greater than or equal to the call price,  the  exchange  ratio
                  will be a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the sum

                  value of a share of comcast  common stock over the call price,
                  and the denominator of which is equal to the fair market value
                  of a share of comcast common stock;

         (b)      if the fair market  value of  a share of comcast  common stock
                  is less than or equal to the put  price,  the  exchange  ratio
                  will be 1;

         (c)      if the fair market value of a share of comcast common stock is
                  less than the call price but greater  than the put price,  the
                  exchange  ratio will be a fraction,  the numerator of which is
                  equal to the put price,  and the denominator of which is equal

         the  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2001 are indexed to 29 million
vodafone adrs,  and will be exchanged at maturity based upon a redemption  value
of $9.00 in cash  plus  21/2  times  the fair  market  value of a  vodafone  adr
(maturity price), as follows:

                  (a) if the  maturity  price is greater  than or equal to $9.00
         plus 21/2  times the call price per share,  each  exchangeable  note is
         equivalent to 0.8101 of the maturity price;

                  (b) if the maturity  price is less than or equal to $9.00 plus
         21/2  times  the  put  price  per  share,  each  exchangeable  note  is
         equivalent to the maturity price; or

                  (c) if the  maturity  price is less than  $71.75 per share but
         greater than $58.125 per share, each exchangeable note is equivalent to
         $58.125.

         the  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2002 are indexed to 26 million
vodafone adrs, and will be exchanged at maturity as follows:

                  (a) if the fair market value of a vodafone adr is greater than
         or equal to the call price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to
         0.8475 of a vodafone adr;

                  (b) if the fair market value of a vodafone adr is less than or
         equal to the put price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to one
         vodafone adr; or

                  (c) if the fair  market  value of a vodafone  adr is less than
         the call price but greater than the put price,  each  exchangeable note
         is  equivalent  to a fraction  of a  vodafone  adr equal to (i) the put
         price divided by (ii) the fair market value of a vodafone adr.

         the  exchangeable  notes  are  being  accounted  for  as  indexed  debt
instruments  since the  maturity  value of the debt is  dependent  upon the fair
market value of the underlying comcast,  microsoft and vodafone securities.  the
exchangeable  notes  contain  embedded  options  that hedge the market risk of a
decline in value of comcast,  microsoft and vodafone securities. the market risk
of a decline in comcast  and  microsoft  stock,  and  vodafone  adrs,  below the
respective put prices has been eliminated.  in addition, any market gains we may
earn have been  limited to the call prices,  with the  exception of certain debt
indexed  to  comcast  stock and the debt  indexed to the  vodafone  adrs,  which
provides for our  participation  in a portion of the market gains above the call
price.

         since the comcast,  microsoft,  and vodafone securities are cost method
investments  being accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities under sfas
no. 115,  "accounting  for certain  investments in debt and equity  securities,"
changes  in the  maturity  value of the  exchangeable  notes and the  underlying
securities  are being  recorded  as  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income
taxes, within other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity.

         the  exchangeable  notes indexed to comcast  common stock and microsoft
common stock are secured by the comcast and microsoft investments at&amp;t; owns. the
exchangeable notes indexed to vodafone adrs are unsecured  obligations,  ranking
equally  in right  of  payment  with  all  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated
obligations of at&amp;t.;

other exchangeable debt

         during 2000, we entered into a series of purchased and written  options
on 21.9 million shares of microsoft common stock, and issued floating rate debt.
the  carrying  value of the debt at december 31,  2000,  was $1,369,  which pays
interest at the three-month  london  inter-bank  offered rate (libor) plus 0.4%.
the debt matures annually with $458 maturing in 2003 and 2004, and $453 maturing
in 2005, and is repayable at at&amp;t;'s option in either microsoft stock or cash.

         in addition, during 1999 two subsidiaries of mediaone,  mediaone spc iv
and mediaone spc vi,  entered into a series of purchased and written  options on
vodafone adrs  contributed to them by mediaone,  and issued  floating rate debt.
the  carrying  value of the debt at december 31,  2000,  was $1,739,  which pays
interest  at the  three-month  libor  plus  0.5%.  this  debt  matures  in equal
quarterly  installments  beginning  in 2003 and  ending in 2005.  the  assets of
mediaone spc iv, which are primarily  29.1 million  vodafone adrs, are available
only to pay the creditors of mediaone spc iv.  likewise,  the assets of mediaone

preferred stock of subsidiaries

         prior to the tci merger,  tci  pacific  communications  inc.  (pacific)
issued 5% class a senior cumulative  exchangeable preferred stock, which remains
outstanding.  there  were 6.3  million  shares  authorized  and  outstanding  at
december 31, 2000 and 1999. each share is exchangeable, from and after august 1,
2001,  for  approximately  6.3 shares of at&amp;t; common  stock,  subject to certain
antidilution adjustments.  additionally, pacific may elect to make any dividend,
redemption  or  liquidation  payment in cash,  shares of at&amp;t; common  stock or a
combination of the foregoing.  the pacific  preferred stock is reflected  within
"minority  interest"  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets,  and
aggregated $2.1 billion at december 31, 2000 and 1999.
<page>

         prior to the tci merger,  tci issued class b 6%  cumulative  redeemable
exchangeable  junior preferred stock (class b preferred  stock).  there were 1.6
million  shares  outstanding  as of december 31,  1999,  net of shares held by a
subsidiary, out of an authorized 1.7 million shares. class b preferred stock and
accumulated  dividends  aggregated $152 at december 31, 1999, and were reflected
within "minority interest" in the accompanying 1999 consolidated  balance sheet.
on february 22, 2000,  all  outstanding  shares of class b preferred  stock were
redeemed at $105.88 per share.

company-obligated   convertible   quarterly  income   preferred   securities  of
subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of at&amp;t; and related
warrants

         on june 16, 1999,  at&amp;t; finance  trust i (at&amp;t;  trust),  a wholly owned
subsidiary  of at&amp;t;,  completed  the private sale of 100 million  shares of 5.0%
cumulative   quarterly  income   preferred   securities   (quarterly   preferred
securities)  to  microsoft.  proceeds of the issuance  were invested by the at&amp;t;
trust in junior  subordinated  debentures  (debentures) issued by at&amp;t; due 2029,
which represent the sole asset of the at&amp;t; trust.

         the quarterly  preferred  securities pay dividends at an annual rate of
5.0% of the liquidation  preference of $50 per security,  and are convertible at
any time prior to maturity into 66.667 million shares of at&amp;t; common stock.  the
quarterly  preferred   securities  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon
repayment  of the  debentures  at  maturity  or their  earlier  redemption.  the
conversion  feature can be  terminated,  under certain  conditions,  after three
years.

         the debentures  will make a quarterly  payment in arrears of 62.5 cents
per  security on the last day of march,  june,  september  and  december of each
year.  at&amp;t; has the right to defer such interest  payments up to 20  consecutive
quarters.  as a  consequence,  quarterly  dividend  payments  on  the  quarterly
preferred  securities  can be  deferred  by  the  at&amp;t;  trust  during  any  such
interest-payment period. if at&amp;t; defers any interest payments, we may not, among
other  things,  pay any  dividends  on our common  stock  until all  interest in
arrears is paid to the at&amp;t; trust.

         dividends on the quarterly preferred  securities were $250 and $135 for
the years ended  december  31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and are  reported
within "minority  interest income  (expense)" in the  accompanying  consolidated
statements of income.

         on june 16, 1999,  at&amp;t; also issued to  microsoft 40 million  warrants,
each to purchase  one share of at&amp;t; common  stock at a price of $75 per share at
the end of  three  years.  alternatively,  the  warrants  are  exercisable  on a
cashless basis. if the warrants are not exercised on the three-year  anniversary
of the closing date, the warrants expire.

         a discount on the quarterly preferred  securities equal to the value of
the warrants of $306 was recognized and is being amortized over the 30-year life
of the  quarterly  preferred  securities  as a component of  "minority  interest
income (expense)" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

centaur funding corporation

         centaur funding corporation (centaur), a subsidiary of mediaone, issued
three  series of  preferred  shares  prior to at&amp;t;'s  acquisition  of  mediaone.
centaur was created for the  principal  purpose of raising  capital  through the

<page>

issuance of preferred  shares and investing  those proceeds into notes issued by
mediaone spc ii, a subsidiary of mediaone.  principal and interest payments from
the notes are expected to be centaur's  primary source of funds to make dividend
and redemption  payments on the preferred shares. in addition,  the dividend and
certain  redemption  payments  on the  preferred  shares will be  determined  by
reference to the  dividend and  redemption  activity of the  preferred  stock of
airtouch communications,  inc. (ati shares) held by mediaone spc ii. payments on
the preferred shares are neither guaranteed nor secured by mediaone or at&amp;t.; the
assets of mediaone spc ii, which include the ati shares,  are available  only to
pay the creditors of mediaone spc ii. these securities  remained  outstanding at
december 31, 2000 as follows:

in the consolidated statement of income.

12.  financial instruments

         in the normal course of business, we use various financial instruments,
including derivative financial instruments,  for purposes other than trading. we
do not use derivative  financial  instruments  for speculative  purposes.  these
instruments  include letters of credit,  guarantees of debt,  interest rate swap
agreements,  foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  option contracts and equity
hedges. collateral is generally not required for these types of instruments.

         by their  nature,  all such  instruments  involve  risk,  including the
credit risk of nonperformance by counterparties,  and our maximum potential loss
may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet.  however, at december 31,
2000 and 1999, in management's opinion, there was no significant risk of loss in
the  event  of   nonperformance   of  the   counterparties  to  these  financial
instruments.  we control our exposure to credit risk through  credit  approvals,
credit limits and monitoring procedures. we do not have any significant exposure
to  any  individual  customer  or  counterparty,   nor  do  we  have  any  major
concentration of credit risk related to any financial instruments.
<page>

letters of credit

         letters of credit are purchased  guarantees that ensure our performance
or payment to third parties in accordance  with specified  terms and conditions.
letters of credit do not create any additional risk to at&amp;t.;

guarantees of debt

         from  time to  time,  we  guarantee  the debt of our  subsidiaries  and
certain  unconsolidated  joint ventures.  prior to the merger, tci had agreed to
take  certain  steps to support  debt  compliance  with  respect to  obligations
aggregating  $1,461 and $1,720 at december 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  of
certain  cable  television  partnerships  in  which  tci  has a  non-controlling
ownership interest. although there can be no assurance, management believes that
it  will  not be  required  to  meet  its  obligations  under  such  guarantees.
additionally,  in connection with the  restructuring  of at&amp;t; in 1996, we issued
guarantees for certain debt obligations of our former  subsidiaries at&amp;t; capital
corp. and ncr. the amount of guaranteed  debt associated with at&amp;t; capital corp.
and ncr was $48 and $56 at december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

interest rate swap agreements

         we enter into  interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in
interest  rates and to lower our overall costs of financing.  we enter into swap
agreements to manage the  fixed/floating  mix of our debt  portfolio in order to
reduce aggregate risk to interest rate movements. interest rate swaps also allow
us to raise funds at floating rates and  effectively  swap them into fixed rates
that are lower than those  available to us if  fixed-rate  borrowings  were made
directly.  these agreements involve the exchange of floating-rate for fixed-rate
payments,  fixed-rate  for  floating-rate  payments or  floating-rate  for other
floating-rate  payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount.
fixed  interest rate  payments at december 31, 2000,  were at rates ranging from
6.05% to 8.20%.  floating-rate payments are based on rates tied to the libor. in
addition,  we also have combined interest rate, foreign currency swap agreements
for  foreign-currency-denominated  debt,  which hedge our risk to both  interest
rate and currency movements.

         the following table indicates the types of swaps in use at december 31,
2000 and 1999, and their weighted-average interest rates. average variable rates
are those in effect at the reporting date and may change  significantly over the
lives of the contracts.

foreign exchange

         we enter into foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  including forward
and option  contracts,  to manage our  exposure to changes in currency  exchange
rates  related  to  foreign-currency-denominated  transactions.  in  2000,  this
consisted  principally  of brazilian  reais and swiss francs related to debt. in
1999,  this consisted  principally of european  union currency  (euro),  british
pounds  sterling and  japanese yen  contracts  related to the  reimbursement  to
foreign telephone  companies for their portion of the revenue billed by at&amp;t; for
calls  placed  in the  united  states  to a foreign  country  and other  foreign
currency  payables  and  receivables.  in  addition,  we are  subject to foreign
exchange risk related to other foreign-currency-denominated transactions.

collars

         we enter into option  agreements  to hedge our exposure on debt that is
indexed to securities we own. during 2000, we entered into a series of purchased
and written  options  related to a portion of our  holdings in  microsoft  stock
(microsoft collar),  which is indexed to floating rate debt. the collar has been
designated  and is effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment in microsoft  stock.  the microsoft  collar is carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the microsoft  stock.  the carrying value of the
microsoft collar was $419 at december 31, 2000.

         at the expiration of the microsoft  collar, if the price of a microsoft
share is equal to or less than the put price of $62.48,  we would  exercise  the
put option and deliver  all  underlying  shares of  microsoft  common  stock and
receive  cash  equal  in  value  to (i) the put  price,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  alternatively,  at our  option,  we can elect not to
deliver the  underlying  shares and instead  settle the put option by  receiving
cash equal in value to the (i) the  difference  between  the put price minus the
fair value of one  microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the  underlying  share
amount. if the price of a microsoft share is greater then the call price,  which
range from $86.26 to $118.36,  then the call option  would be  exercised  and we
would deliver all  underlying  shares and receive cash equal in value to (i) the
call price,  multiplied by (ii) the underlying share amount.  at our option,  we
can elect not to  deliver  the  underlying  shares and  instead  settle the call
option by paying cash equal in value to the (i) the difference  between the call
price  minus  the fair  value of one  microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  any  cash  received  by at&amp;t;  from the  exercise  or
settlement  of either put or call  option  would be used to retire the  floating
rate debt.  we would  retain cash in excess of the call price from a call option
exercise.  if the price of a  microsoft  share is between  the put price and the
call price, the collar will expire without value.

         prior to our  merger  with  mediaone,  two  subsidiaries  of  mediaone,
mediaone  spc iv and mediaone  spc vi,  entered  into a series of purchased  and
written  options  (vodafone  collars) on vodafone  adrs  contributed  to them by
mediaone,  and  issued  floating  rate  debt.  the  vodafone  collars  have been
designated and are effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment  in vodafone  adrs.  the vodafone  collars are carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the vodafone  adrs.  the  carrying  value of the
vodafone collars was $453 at december 31, 2000.

         at the  expiration of the mediaone spc iv collar,  we will receive cash
if the market  value of a  vodafone  adr is less than  approximately  $34.00 per
share,  effectively  eliminating  downside  risk on the stock  below  $34.00 per
share.  conversely,  if the  market  value of a  vodafone  adr is  greater  than
approximately  $49.00 per share, we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
offset by the  corresponding  increase in the value of the  vodafone  adr.  this
vodafone collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005.

         at the  expiration of the mediaone spc vi collar,  we will receive cash
if the market  value of a  vodafone  adr is less than  approximately  $40.00 per
share,  effectively  eliminating  downside  risk on the stock  below  $40.00 per
share.  conversely,  if the  market  value of a  vodafone  adr is  greater  than
approximately  $58.00 per share, we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
offset by the  corresponding  increase in the value of the  vodafone  adr.  this
vodafone collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005.

fair values of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments

         the  following  table  summarizes  the  notional  amounts  of  material
financial  instruments.  the notional amounts represent  agreed-upon  amounts on
which  calculations of dollars to be exchanged are based.  they do not represent
amounts  exchanged  by the  parties  and,  therefore,  are not a measure  of our
exposure.  our  exposure  is limited to the fair value of the  contracts  with a
positive fair value plus interest receivable, if any, at the reporting date.

13.  pension, postretirement and other employee benefit plans

         we sponsor noncontributory,  defined benefit pension plans covering the
majority of our employees.  pension benefits for management  employees are based
principally on career-average  pay. pension benefits for occupational  employees
are not directly related to pay. pension trust  contributions  are made to trust
funds held for the sole  benefit of plan  participants.  our  benefit  plans for
current and certain future retirees include health-care benefits, life insurance
coverage and telephone concessions.

*        primarily  included  in "net  restructuring  and other  charges" in the
         consolidated statements of income.

         on january  26,  1998,  we  offered a  voluntary  retirement  incentive
program  (vrip)  to  employees  who  were  eligible  participants  in  the  at&amp;t;
management pension plan.  approximately 15,300 management employees accepted the
vrip offer.  in connection with the vrip, we recorded pretax charges in 1998 for
pension and postretirement plan special-termination benefits of $2,254 and $169,
respectively. we also recorded pension and postretirement plan pretax charges of
$120 and $143, respectively, which are included within net curtailment losses in
1998.  the  special-termination  benefits  reflect the value of pension  benefit
improvements and expanded eligibility for postretirement benefits. the vrip also
permitted  employees to choose  either a total  lump-sum  distribution  of their
pension benefits or periodic future annuity payments.

         as of december 31, 1999, all 15,300 employees had terminated employment
under the vrip. at&amp;t; has settled the pension  obligations  covering about 15,100
of these  employees,  the  remainder of which  either chose to defer  commencing
their pension benefits or elected to receive an annuity  distribution.  lump-sum
pension  settlements   totaling  $5.2  billion,   including  a  portion  of  the
special-pension  termination benefits referred to above,  resulted in settlement
gains of $121 and $940 recorded in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         our  nonqualified  pension  plans had an unfunded  accumulated  benefit
obligation  of $125 and $118 at december  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  our
postretirement  health and telephone  concession  benefit plans had  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations of $4,282 and $4,021 at december 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively,  which were in excess of plan assets of $1,413 and $1,635 at
december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         the   assumptions   used  in  the   measurement   of  the  pension  and
postretirement benefit obligations are shown in the following table:

expected return on plan assets...............     9.5%     9.5%    9.5%
rate of compensation increase................     4.5%     4.5%    4.5%
</c></c></c></s></caption></table>

         we  assumed  a rate of  increase  in the  per  capita  cost of  covered
health-care  benefits (the  health-care  cost trend rate) of 7.6%. this rate was
assumed to gradually  decline  after 2000 to 4.5% by 2010 and then remain level.
assumed  health-care  cost trend rates have a significant  effect on the amounts
reported for the health-care  plans. a one percentage point increase or decrease
in the assumed  health-care cost trend rate would increase or decrease the total
of the service  and  interest-cost  components  of net  periodic  postretirement
health-care  benefit  cost by $9 and $9,  respectively,  and would  increase  or
decrease the  health-care  component of the accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation by $125 and $122, respectively.

         we also sponsor  savings plans for the majority of our  employees.  the
plans allow  employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and/or  after-tax
income in accordance  with  specified  guidelines.  we match a percentage of the
employee  contributions up to certain limits. our contributions amounted to $280
in 2000, $234 in 1999 and $204 in 1998.

14.  stock-based compensation plans

         under  the  1997  long-term  incentive  program  (program),  which  was
effective june 1, 1997, and amended on may 19, 1999 and march 14, 2000, we grant
stock options,  performance  shares,  restricted  stock and other awards on at&amp;t;
common stock as well as stock options on at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.

         under the program,  there were 150 million  shares of at&amp;t; common stock
available  for grant with a maximum of 22.5 million  common shares that could be
used for awards other than stock  options.  beginning  with january 1, 2000, the
remaining  shares  available  for grant at december  31 of the prior year,  plus
1.75% of the shares of at&amp;t; common stock  outstanding on january 1 of each year,
become available for grant.  there are a maximum of 37.5 million shares that may
be used for awards other than stock  options.  the  exercise  price of any stock
option is equal to the stock  price when the option is granted.  generally,  the
options  vest over three or four years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from
the date of grant.

         under the program, performance share units are awarded to key employees
in the form of either  common stock or cash at the end of a  three-year  period,
based on at&amp;t;'s  total  shareholder  return  and  certain  financial-performance
targets.  under the 1987 long-term  incentive  program,  performance share units
with  the same  terms  were  also  awarded  to key  employees  based  on  at&amp;t;'s
return-to-equity performance compared with a target.
<page>

         on april 27, 2000,  at&amp;t; created a new class of stock and  completed an
offering of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock.  under the program,  5% of the
outstanding at&amp;t; wireless group shares became available for grant with a maximum
of 1.25% of the  outstanding  shares  that may be used  for  awards  other  than
options.  beginning  with january 1, 2001,  the remaining  at&amp;t;  wireless  group
shares  available  for grant at december  31 of the prior  year,  plus 2% of the
outstanding  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  shares  on  january 1 of each  year,  become
available  for grant.  the  exercise  price of any stock  option is equal to the
stock price when the option is granted.  generally, the options vest over two to
three and  one-half  years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from the date of
grant.  in 2000,  there were no grants of awards  other than stock  options.  on
april 27, 2000,  substantially  all employees  were granted at&amp;t; wireless  group
tracking stock options.

         under the at&amp;t; 1996  employee  stock  purchase  plan (plan),  which was
effective  july 1, 1996, we are  authorized  to sell up to 75 million  shares of
at&amp;t;  common  stock to our  eligible  employees.  under  the  terms of the plan,
employees  may have up to 10% of their  earnings  withheld  to  purchase  at&amp;t;'s
common stock.  the purchase price of the stock on the date of exercise is 85% of
the average  high and low sale  prices of shares on the new york stock  exchange
for that  day.  under  the  plan,  we sold  approximately  6  million  shares to
employees in 2000 and 3 million shares to employees in both 1999 and 1998.

         we  apply  apb  opinion  no.  25,   "accounting  for  stock  issued  to
employees,"   and  related   interpretations   in  accounting   for  our  plans.
accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for our stock-based
compensation  plans other than for our  performance-based  and restricted  stock
awards and stock appreciation  rights (sars).  stock  based-compensation  income
(expense)  was $253,  $(462)  and $(157) in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.
these  amounts  included  income  (expense) of $269 and $(382) in 2000 and 1999,
respectively,  related to grants of sars of affiliated companies held by certain
employees  subsequent to the tci merger. we also entered into an equity hedge in
1999 to offset potential future  compensation  costs associated with these sars.
(expense)  income  related  to this  hedge was $(297) and $247 in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

         the pro forma  effect on net income for 1998 may not be  representative
of the pro forma effect on net income of future  years  because the sfas no. 123
method of accounting for pro forma compensation  expense has not been applied to

         the weighted-average fair values at date of grant for at&amp;t; common stock
options  granted  during  2000,  1999 and 1998 were  $12.10,  $15.64  and $9.75,

the  weighted-average  risk-free  interest rates applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998
were  6.29%,  5.10% and 5.33%,  respectively.  the  following  assumptions  were
applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively:  (i) expected dividend yields of
1.6%, 1.7% and 2.1%, (ii) expected  volatility  rates of 33.5%,  28.3% and 23.8%

         in addition,  we also recorded current and deferred income tax expenses
(benefits)  related to minority  interest and net equity  losses on other equity
investments  in the  amounts of $(154)  and $(125) in 2000,  $(94) and $(344) in
1999 and $143 and $(120) in 1998, respectively.

         deferred  income tax  liabilities  are taxes we expect to pay in future
periods.  similarly,  deferred  income  tax  assets are  recorded  for  expected
reductions  in taxes  payable in future  periods.  deferred  income  taxes arise
because  of  differences  in the  book  and tax  bases  of  certain  assets  and
liabilities.

         at  december  31,  2000,  we  had  net  operating  loss   carryforwards
(tax-effected), excluding excite@home, for federal and state income tax purposes
of $79 and $164,  respectively,  expiring  through  2015.  in  addition,  we had
federal tax credit  carryforwards  of $145, of which $64 have no expiration date
and $81  expire  through  2005.  we also  had  state  tax  credit  carryforwards
(tax-effected)  of $32 expiring through 2003. in connection with the tci merger,
we acquired certain federal and state net operating loss  carryforwards  subject
to a valuation  allowance of $59. if, in the future,  the  realization  of these
acquired  deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not, any reduction of the
associated  valuation  allowance will be allocated to reduce franchise costs and
other purchased intangibles.
<page>

         at december 31, 2000,  excite@home had net operating loss carryforwards
(tax  effected)  for federal  and state  income tax  purposes  of $290  expiring
through 2020.  utilization of excite@home's net operating loss carryforwards may
be subject to a minor annual limitation due to the ownership change  limitations
provided by the internal  revenue code of 1986,  as amended,  and similar  state
provisions.  the annual  limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of
excite@home's  net  operating  loss  carryforwards   before   utilization.   the
realization  of   excite@home's   net  deferred  tax  asset  is  dependent  upon
excite@home's  future  earnings,  if any,  the  timing  and  amount of which are
uncertain.  in addition,  excite@home is a separate taxpayer and is not a member
of  the  at&amp;t;  consolidated  tax  group.  accordingly,  excite@home  provided  a
valuation allowance in an amount equal to its net deferred tax assets of $702 as
of december 31, 2000. approximately $142 of excite@home's valuation allowance at
december 31, 2000, is  attributable to stock option  deductions,  the benefit of
which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized.  approximately  $269 of
excite@home's  valuation  allowance  at december 31, 2000,  is  attributable  to
deferred  tax assets  that,  if  realized,  will be  allocated  to first  reduce
goodwill, then other purchased intangibles, and then income tax expense.

         on november 15, 2000, we announced our intention to split-off  lmg. the
split-off  of  lmg  remains  subject  to the  receipt  of  necessary  approvals,
including a  favorable  tax ruling  from the irs.  pursuant  to the  tax-sharing
agreement  dated  march  9,  1999  between  at&amp;t; and lmg,  in the  event  lmg is
split-off,  at&amp;t; would be required to reimburse lmg  approximately  $830 for the
value of certain tci pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards.  also, in
connection  with a tax-sharing  agreement  between lmg and tci that was executed
prior  to  at&amp;t;'s  acquisition  of tci,  lmg  would  be  obligated  to pay  at&amp;t;
approximately $138 upon its split-off from at&amp;t.;

16.  commitments and contingencies

         in the  normal  course  of  business  we are  subject  to  proceedings,
lawsuits and other  claims,  including  proceedings  under laws and  regulations
related to  environmental  and other  matters.  such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. consequently, we
are unable to ascertain the ultimate  aggregate amount of monetary  liability or
financial  impact with  respect to these  matters at december  31,  2000.  these
matters could affect the  operating  results of any one quarter when resolved in
future periods.  however, we believe that after final disposition,  any monetary
liability or financial  impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end  would
not be material to our annual consolidated financial statements.

         we lease land, buildings and equipment through contracts that expire in
various years through 2037. our rental expense under  operating  leases was $980
in 2000,  $827 in 1999 and $742 in 1998.  the  total of  minimum  rentals  to be
received in the future under  noncancelable  operating  subleases as of december
31, 2000, was $209.

         the  following  table shows our future  minimum  commitments  due under
noncancelable operating and capital leases at december 31, 2000:

         at&amp;t; has an agreement with motorola, inc. to purchase a minimum of 1.25
million  digital  set-top  devices at an average price of $248 per unit in 2001.
during 2000,  at&amp;t;  satisfied its  obligation  under a previous  agreement  with
motorola, inc. to purchase set-top devices.

         at&amp;t; has entered into various purchase commitments for wireless network
equipment and handsets.  the  commitments  totaled $432 as of december 31, 2000,
and extend through 2004.

         at&amp;t; has  committed  to provide  funding to a joint  venture with other
investors,  alaska native wireless  (anw),  which was formed in november 2000 to
participate in the federal  communication  commission's  recent license spectrum
auction.  the  auction  was  concluded  in january  2001 and anw was the highest
bidder on  approximately  $2.9 billion in licenses.  at&amp;t; has  committed to fund
approximately  $2.6  billion  to anw to fund  anw's  purchase  of  licenses.  at
december  31,  2000,  at&amp;t; had  provided  approximately  $229 of funding and has
committed to provide additional funding of approximately $2.4 billion consisting
primarily of debt securities of anw. at the fifth  anniversary of the first date
on which  licenses  are granted to anw,  the other  owners of anw have rights to
require at&amp;t; to purchase  their equity  interests.  if such rights are exercised
five  years  after  the  license  grant  date,   the  purchase  price  would  be
approximately  $950 and would be  payable,  at our  option,  in  either  cash or
marketable  securities.  in the event that these rights are exercised before the
fifth anniversary,  or in the event that the winning bid is rejected,  or if any
licenses granted to anw are revoked or challenged, the amount that at&amp;t; would be
required to pay would be less than $950.

         through a joint  venture (70% owned by at&amp;t; and 30% owned by bt),  at&amp;t;
and bt have a 31%  ownership of at&amp;t; canada corp. as a result of the 1999 merger
between at&amp;t; canada corp. and metronet communications,  corp. in connection with
this merger, the at&amp;t; and bt joint venture has the right to call, or arrange for
another  entity to call,  the  remaining  69% of at&amp;t;  canada for the greater of
cdn$40.56 per share,  which  represented  the projected value as of december 31,
2000,  with an accretion of 4% each quarter that began on june 30, 2000,  or the
then-appraised  fair market value. if we do not exercise our call rights by june
30,  2003,  the shares  would be put up for  auction,  and the at&amp;t; and bt joint
venture would have to make the shareholders whole for the difference between the
proceeds  received in auction  and the  greater of the fair market  value or the
accreted  value.  the exact  timing of any  purchase  will  likely be  partially
dependent upon the future status of canadian foreign-ownership regulations.

17.  related party transactions

         at&amp;t; has various related party transactions with concert as a result of
the closure of this global venture in early january 2000.

         included in revenue for the year ended  december 31,  2000,  is $1,080,
for services provided to concert.

         included  in access and other  connection  expenses  for the year ended

behalf to connect calls made to foreign  countries  (international  settlements)
and costs paid by at&amp;t; to concert for  distributing  concert  products  totaling
$2,364.

         during the first quarter of 2000, at&amp;t; contributed property,  plant and
equipment  of  approximately  $1,600  to  concert.  at&amp;t; also  loaned  $1,000 to
concert;  that loan is included within "other  investments and related advances"
in the accompanying 2000 consolidated balance sheet.  interest income of $67 was
recognized for the year ended december 31, 2000.

         at december 31, 2000,  at&amp;t; had a floating rate loan payable to concert
in the amount of $126.  the loan,  which is due on demand,  is included in "debt
maturing  within  one  year" in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet.
interest expense was $6 for the year ended december 31, 2000.

         included in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable at december 31,
2000, was $462 and $518,  respectively,  related to  transactions  with concert.
included in other  receivables  and other  current  liabilities  at december 31,
2000, was $1,106 and $1,032,  respectively,  related to transactions  associated
with concert.

         in  addition,  we had  various  related  party  transactions  with lmg.
included in costs of services and products were programming  expenses related to
services from lmg. these  expenses  amounted to $239 for the year ended december
31, 2000 and $184 for the 10 months ended december 31, 1999, respectively.

         included in "investment in liberty media group and related receivables,
net" was $155 and $27 at  december  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  primarily
related to taxes pursuant to a tax-sharing  agreement between lmg and broadband.
that agreement existed prior to the tci merger.

18.  segment reporting

         at&amp;t;'s  results  are  segmented  according  to  the way we  manage  our
business: business services, consumer services, wireless services and broadband.

         our business services segment offers a variety of global communications
services,  including long distance,  local, and data and internet  protocol (ip)
networking,   to  small  and   medium-sized   businesses,   large  domestic  and
multinational  businesses and government  agencies.  business services is also a
provider  of  voice,  data and ip  transport  to  service  resellers  (wholesale
services). also included in the business services segment is at&amp;t; solutions, our
outsourcing and network-management business.

         our  consumer  services  segment  provides  a variety  of  any-distance
communications  services,  including long distance, local toll (intrastate calls
outside the immediate local area) and internet access to residential  customers.
in   addition,   consumer   services   provides   prepaid   calling   card   and
operator-handled  calling  services.  local  phone  service is also  provided in
certain areas.
<page>

         our wireless  services  segment offers wireless voice and data services
and products to customers in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and 1900  megahertz
(personal  communications  services,  or pcs)  markets.  wireless  services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the  united  states  and  internationally,  aviation-communications
services  and  fixed  wireless  services.  fixed  wireless  provides  high-speed
internet  access and  any-distance  voice services using wireless  technology to
residential and small business customers.

         our broadband  segment  offers a variety of services  through our cable
broadband network,  including  traditional analog video and new services such as
digital video, high-speed data and broadband telephony.

         the  balance of at&amp;t;'s  operations  (excluding  lmg) is  included  in a
"corporate and other" category. this category reflects corporate staff functions
and the elimination of transactions between segments,  as well as the results of
excite@home and international  operations and ventures.  lmg is not an operating
segment of at&amp;t; because at&amp;t; does not have a controlling  financial  interest in
lmg for financial accounting purposes. therefore, we account for this investment
under the equity  method.  additionally,  lmg's  results are not reviewed by the
chief  operating  decision-makers  for purposes of  determining  resources to be
allocated.

         total assets for our reportable  segments generally include all assets,
except intercompany receivables. however, our wireless services segment included
intercompany  receivables  from at&amp;t; and the related interest income since these
assets  relate to the  results  of the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  tracked  business.
prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
held at the  corporate  level and  therefore,  are included in the corporate and
other  category.  shared  network  assets  are  allocated  to the  segments  and
reallocated  each january based on two years of volumes.  capital  additions for
each segment include  capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment,
acquisitions of licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in
franchise costs and additions to internal-use software.

         the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant  accounting  policies (see note 1). at&amp;t; evaluates
performance based on several factors,  of which the primary financial measure is
earnings before interest and taxes,  including pretax minority  interest and net
pretax losses from other equity investments (ebit).

         generally,   at&amp;t;  accounts  for  business  services'  and  broadband's
intersegment transactions at market prices.

20.  consolidating condensed financial information

         in  conjunction  with the issuance of at&amp;t;  wireless  group and liberty
media group tracking stocks, at&amp;t; has separated for financial reporting purposes
in all  periods  the at&amp;t;  common  stock  group,  liberty  media  group and at&amp;t;
wireless group. below is the consolidating  financial information reflecting the
businesses of these  individual  groups,  including  the  allocation of expenses
between the groups in accordance with our allocation policies,  as well as other
related party transactions such as sales of services between groups and interest
income and  expense on  intercompany  borrowings.  the at&amp;t;  common  stock group
presented  below  excludes  its retained  portion of the value of at&amp;t;  wireless
group. at&amp;t; does not have a controlling  financial interest in lmg for financial
accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  lmg  is  reflected  as an
investment accounted for under the equity method and is reflected as such in the
consolidating financial statements below.

         at&amp;t; wireless group,  purchases long distance and other network-related
services  from at&amp;t; at  market-based  prices and  accordingly  such  amounts are
eliminated.  prior to the offering of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking  stock,  the
capital  structure of at&amp;t;  wireless  group had been  assumed  based upon at&amp;t;'s
historical capital ratio adjusted for certain items. intercompany interest rates
are  intended to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rate that at&amp;t;
wireless  group  would be able to obtain  or  receive  if it were a  stand-alone
entity.  general corporate overhead related to at&amp;t;'s corporate headquarters and
common support  divisions has been allocated to at&amp;t; wireless group based on the
ratio  of  at&amp;t;  wireless   group's   external  costs  and  expenses  to  at&amp;t;'s
consolidated  external costs and expenses,  adjusted for any functions that at&amp;t;
wireless  group  performs on its own.  the  consolidated  income tax  provision,
related tax  payments or refunds,  and  deferred  tax balances of at&amp;t; have been
alloated to at&amp;t; wireless group based  principally on the taxable income and tax
credits directly attributable to at&amp;t; wireless group.

         pursuant to the inter-group  agreement,  at&amp;t; does not allocate general
overhead expenses to libery media group and only charges liberty media group for
specific  services  that  liberty  media group  receives  from at&amp;t;  pursuant to
service agreements or similar arrangements. additionally, as liberty media group
operates independent of at&amp;t;, there is no cash or debt allocated to them.

22.  new accounting pronouncements

         in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb) issued
sfas no. 133,  "accounting for derivative  instruments and hedging  activities."
among other provisions,  it requires that entities  recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial  position and measure
those instruments at fair value.  gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. the effective date
for this  standard was delayed via the  issuance of sfas no. 137. the  effective
date for sfas no. 133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after june 15,  2000,
though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.
for at&amp;t;,  this means that the standard must be adopted no later than january 1,
2001.

         in june 2000,  the fasb issued sfas no.  138,  "accounting  for certain
derivative  instruments and certain hedging activities," as an amendment to sfas
no.  133.  this  statement   provides   clarification  with  regard  to  certain
implementation issues under sfas no. 133 on specific types of hedges.

         on january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; adopted sfas no. 133. we recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$1,370  of  income,  or  approximately   $0.34  per  diluted  share,   primarily
attributable  to fair value  adjustments of debt  instruments,  including  those
acquired in  conjunction  with the  mediaone  merger,  as well as to our warrant
portfolio.  in  addition,  in  connection  with the adoption of sfas no. 133, we
reclassified certain investment  securities,  which support debt that is indexed
to   those   securities,    from   "available-for-sale"   to   "trading."   this
reclassification  resulted  in  the  recognition  of  a  charge  of  $1,724,  or
approximately  $0.43 per  diluted  share,  net of  applicable  taxes,  which was
recorded as a  reduction  of other  income.  as  available-for-sale  securities,
changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive income
as a component of shareowners'  equity.  in addition,  lmg recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$800 of income, or approximately $0.31 per share.

         the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 133, as amended by sfas no. 138,
on at&amp;t;'s future  results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of our
derivatives  and related  financial  instruments  and could result in pronounced
quarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods.

         in  september  2000,  the fasb  issued sfas no.  140,  "accounting  for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and  extinguishments  of liabilities
- -- a replacement of fasb statement no. 125." this statement provides  accounting
and reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of  liabilities.  under  these  standards,  after a transfer of

23.  subsequent events

         on january 12, 2001,  at&amp;t; announced that cox and comcast had exercised
their  rights to sell a combined  total of 60.4  million  shares of  excite@home
series a common stock to at&amp;t; as part of an  agreement  announced in august 2000
to  reorganize  excite@home's  governance.  cox and  comcast  elected to receive
shares of at&amp;t; common stock in exchange for their  excite@home  shares.  at&amp;t; is
currently in discussions  to renegotiate  the terms of the put options which may
result in a change to the number of shares of at&amp;t;  stock  that cox and  comcast
will receive, as well as the number of excite@home shares, if any at&amp;t; receives.
there  can be no  assurance  that an  agreement  will be  reached  with  cox and
comcast.

         on  january  22,  2001,  at&amp;t;  and ntt  docomo  (docomo)  finalized  an
agreement whereby docomo invested  approximately $9.8 billion for a new class of
at&amp;t;  preferred  stock,   termed  docomo  wireless   tracking  stock,   that  is
economically  equivalent to 406 million  shares of at&amp;t; wireless  group tracking
stock and reflects  approximately 16% of the financial  performance and economic
value of at&amp;t; wireless  group.  at&amp;t;  allocated  $6.2 billion of the proceeds to
at&amp;t; wireless group. each share of docomo wireless tracking stock is convertible
at any time into at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.  upon the conversion of the
docomo wireless  tracking  stock,  at&amp;t; will reduce its portion of the financial
performance and economic value in at&amp;t; wireless group by 178 million shares, and
the balance of the 406 million shares will come from the issuance of 228 million
new shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock. additionally,  upon completion
of the planned  split-off of at&amp;t; wireless,  the docomo wireless  tracking stock
and related  warrants will  automatically  be converted into at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking stock in the split-off.  in the event that at&amp;t;
has not split-off at&amp;t; wireless by specified  dates  beginning  january 1, 2002,
docomo will have the right, at its election,  to require at&amp;t; to repurchase from
docomo  the  preferred  shares  initially  issued to them at  docomo's  original
purchase price plus interest up to the date of payment.  the interest under this
right will be treated as preferred stock  dividends,  with charges recorded as a
reduction of at&amp;t; common stock group  earnings.  in  addition,  docomo  acquired
five-year  warrants to purchase the  equivalent  of an  additional  41.7 million
shares of at&amp;t; wireless group  tracking  stock at $35 per share.  as part of the
agreement,  docomo  obtained  a seat on at&amp;t;'s  board of  directors  until  at&amp;t;
wireless group is split-off  from at&amp;t; as a separate  public  company,  which is
expected to occur later in 2001. at that time, docomo will retain representation
on the new public at&amp;t; wireless board.  receipt of the docomo  proceeds  reduced
at&amp;t;'s existing $25 billion credit facility by $1.8 billion.

         in january  2001,  at&amp;t; entered into  agreements  with certain  network
equipment  vendors,  which  extend  through  2004,  to purchase  next-generation
wireless network equipment for a total of approximately $1.8 billion.

         on february 27, 2001,  at&amp;t;  entered  into an agreement  with  vodafone
group plc to sell our 10% stake in japan telecom co. ltd for approximately $1.35
billion in cash.  the  transaction is expected to be completed in april 2001 and
will result in a gain.

         on march 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless  completed a private  placement of $6.5
billion in notes.  the notes pay  interest at rates  ranging from 7.35% to 8.75%
per annum,  with  maturity  dates  ranging from 2006 to 2031.  the notes include
customary  covenants  and  registration  rights.  as a result of the issuance of
these notes,  at&amp;t;'s  existing $25 billion  credit  facility was reduced by $4.8
billion.

         on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless entered into $2.5 billion in revolving
credit facilities. the facilities consist of a 364-day facility of $1.25 billion
and a five-year  revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion.  the facilities may
be used for general  corporate  purposes and are subject to customary  covenants
and events of default.
