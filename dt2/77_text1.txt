part i

item 1. business.

general

         at&amp;t; corp. was  incorporated in 1885 under the laws of the state of new
york and has its principal  executive offices at 32 avenue of the americas,  new
york, new york 10013-2412 (telephone number 212-387-5400).

         on   march   9,   1999,    at&amp;t;    completed   the    acquisition    of
tele-communications,  inc. (tci) in a merger.  in the merger,  at&amp;t; acquired all
the  business and assets of the tci group (now  referred to as at&amp;t;  broadband),
which  consisted  primarily  of  tci's  domestic  cable  and  telecommunications
operations, as well as tci's interest in at home corporation (@home) in exchange
for  approximately  664  million  shares  of common  stock.  at&amp;t;  common  stock
continues to represent an interest in the business and assets of the  historical
at&amp;t; together with those assets acquired in the merger.

         in  addition,  at the time of the merger  tci  combined  liberty  media
group, its programming  arm, and tci ventures group, its technology  investments
unit, to form the new liberty media group.  the  shareowners  of the new liberty
media group were issued separate  tracking stock rather than traditional  common
stock by at&amp;t; corp.  in exchange for the shares held in liberty  media group and
tci ventures  group.  under the tracking  stock  arrangement,  the liberty media
group's  earnings  and losses will be excluded  from  earnings  available to the
holders of common stock and the liberty media group's businesses and assets will
be managed by a separate operating board of directors. as a result, although the
liberty  media group is wholly owned by at&amp;t; corp.,  it is  accounted  for as an
investment under the equity method of accounting in the  consolidated  financial
statements  of at&amp;t;  corp.  since  at&amp;t; does not have a  "controlling  financial
interest" in the liberty media group.

         consequently,  throughout  this  document,  references  to  at&amp;t; or the
company refer to the  businesses,  results or assets  attributable to the common
stock;  references to liberty media refer to the  businesses,  results or assets
attributable to the liberty media group tracking  stock;  and references to at&amp;t;
corp.  refer to the  combined  legal  entity.  references  herein to at&amp;t; common
shares,  common  shares,  at&amp;t; common stock or common stock excludes the liberty
media group tracking stock.

         on march 14, 2000 the at&amp;t; shareholders approved amendments to the at&amp;t;
certificate of  incorporation  that would permit at&amp;t; to create a separate class
of its common stock,  the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock,  which would track
the  performance  of our wireless  business.  as of the date of filing this form
10-k, no shares of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock were outstanding.

         at&amp;t; is among the world's communications leaders, providing voice, data

disposed of assets and businesses that were not strategic. in october 1996, at&amp;t;
completed the sale of its majority interest in at&amp;t; capital corporation (leasing
services business).  in 1997, at&amp;t; completed the sales of at&amp;t; skynet (satellite

transform  the company from one  dominated by a single  product,  domestic  long
distance  telecommunications,  to a fully  integrated,  any distance,  broadband
communications  service  provider.  in july 1998, at&amp;t; completed the merger with
teleport  communications  group  (tcg)  pursuant  to which each share of tcg was
exchanged for at&amp;t; common stock in an all-stock transaction. tcg was the largest
competitive  local  exchange  carrier  (clec)  in the  united  states,  offering
comprehensive   telecommunications   services  in  major  metropolitan   markets
throughout the united states.  tcg provides a broad array of  telecommunications

the ibm global network  business  (renamed at&amp;t; global network services or agns)
by obtaining the ibm global network assets in the united states. under the terms
of the agreement,  at&amp;t; acquired the global network of ibm for  approximately $5
billion,  and the two companies  entered into  outsourcing  agreements with each
other. ibm is outsourcing a significant  portion of its global  networking needs
to  at&amp;t;,  and  at&amp;t;  is   outsourcing   certain   applications-processing   and
data-center-management  operations to ibm. agns serves the  networking  needs of
several  hundred  large  global  companies,   tens  of  thousands  of  mid-sized
businesses and more than one million individual  internet users in 59 countries.
about 5,300 ibm employees joined at&amp;t; as part of the acquisition.  agns has more
than 1,300 dial-up  points of presence and  dedicated  access from more than 850
cities in 59 countries.  agns offers business customers  innovative services and
worldwide operations and support, including in-country,  native-language support
personnel.  the  acquisition  occurred  in phases  throughout  1999 as legal and
regulatory  requirements were met in each of the countries in which the business
operates.  as of december 31, 1999,  operations  in over 70 countries  have been
transferred  from  ibm to  at&amp;t;,  representing  more  than  99% of the  contract
revenue.  we are awaiting  regulatory  approval in the  remaining  countries and

various cable systems,  which are designed to improve each company's  geographic
coverage by better  clustering  its systems.  the agreement will result in a net
addition to comcast of approximately  750,000 subscribers.  because comcast will
receive more  subscribers  than it is contributing in the exchange,  it will pay
at&amp;t; consideration  having a value of approximately  $4,500 per added subscriber
for a total value of $3.0  billion to $3.5  billion.  comcast has also agreed to
offer  at&amp;t-branded;  telephony  in  all  of  its  markets,  subject  to  certain

that the aggregate  consideration  will consist of $30.85 per share in cash plus

per share.  the  additional  amount of cash that may be  received  is limited to
$5.42 per share.  at&amp;t;  estimates that we will issue  approximately  600 million

other approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2000.

         metronet merger

         on june 1, 1999, at&amp;t; canada corp. merged with metronet  communications
corp.,  canada's largest competitive local exchange carrier.  under the terms of

exchange access, toll, and resold services;  sell, install and maintain customer
premises equipment;  and provide operator and directory services. the market for
local exchange  services  consists of a number of distinct  service  components.
these   service   components   are   defined  by  specific   regulatory   tariff
classifications  including:  (i) local network services, which generally include
basic dial tone charges and private line services; (ii) network access services,
which consist of access charges received by local exchange  carriers (lecs) from
long distance  carriers for the local transport and termination  portion of long
distance  telephone calls;  (iii) long distance network services,  which include
the  variable  portion  of  charges  received  by local  exchange  carriers  for
intra-lata long distance calls; and (iv) additional value added services such as
caller  identification,  call waiting,  call  forwarding,  three way calling and
voice mail.

         at&amp;t;     business      local's      customers      are      principally
telecommunications-intensive    businesses,    healthcare,    and    educational

also targets small- and medium-sized  business  customers in office buildings or
multiple dwelling units already served by its network.

<page>

         at&amp;t; business local  generally  offers its services in accordance  with
applicable  tariffs  filed  with  state  regulatory   agencies  (for  intrastate
services).  at&amp;t;  business  local  typically  offers local  service as part of a
package of services,  which can include any combination of other at&amp;t; offerings.

         data and internet services

         enhanced  data  communications.   enhanced  data  services  consist  of
interexchange   data  networks   utilizing  packet  switching  and  transmission
technologies  and  application  services,  such as internet  access and web site
hosting and  management,  which utilize the frame relay  network.  enhanced data
services enable customers to economically and securely transmit large volumes of
data typically  sent in bursts from one site to another.  enhanced data services
are utilized for local area network (lan) interconnection, remote site, point of
sale and branch office communications solutions.

         at&amp;t;  utilizes  both  ip  and  atm  systems.  both  technologies  offer
significant  efficiencies  over  circuit  switched  systems  which use a single,
dedicated  circuit to complete each  transmission.  atm switching is also a more
efficient  method  of  switching  and   transmitting   comingled  or  multimedia
information. the packet switching technology breaks up a transmission into short
pieces, or packets,  which are encoded and transmitted with other packets on the
same circuit, and reassembled at the desired destination. atm differs from ip in
that the data packets used in atm (called cells) are one size (53 bytes) whereas
in ip the data packets vary in length.  also,  whereas atm  establishes  virtual
circuits to ensure that the  information  sent is reassembled at its destination
in its proper  sequence,  ip ships each packet of information to its destination
by a different  path.  while at&amp;t; will  continue to have both circuit and packet
switching  and  transmission  technologies  for some  time,  significant  future
capital expenditures are not scheduled for circuit switching.

         isdn  services   provide   customers   with  multiple  voice  and  data
communications  services over a single  telecommunications  line.  the company's
isdn services allow customers to perform multiple functions such as simultaneous
voice and computer links, and enable the company to offer customers  value-added
features.  high speed isdn  applications  include  desk top video  conferencing,
interconnection of lans and internet access.

         at&amp;t;  business  internet  services.  at&amp;t;  worldnet  business  services
provides ip connectivity and ip value-added services,  messaging, and electronic
commerce  services to businesses.  at&amp;t; offers managed internet  service,  which
gives customers dedicated, high-speed access to the public internet for business
applications  at a variety of speeds and types of  access,  as well as  business
dial service, a dial-up version of internet access designed to meet the needs of
small- and medium-sized businesses.

         at&amp;t; virtual private network (vpn) service allows  businesses to obtain
remote  access to e-mail,  order  entry  systems,  employee  directories,  human

carriers.

         wholesale   networking   service  is  typically  provided  pursuant  to
long-term service  agreements for terms of one year or longer.  these agreements
generally  provide for  payments at fixed rates based on the capacity and length
of the circuit used.  customers are typically billed on a monthly basis and also
may incur an  installation  charge or certain  ancillary  charges for equipment.
after contract  expiration,  the contracts may be renewed or the services may be

consumer services

         long distance voice

         at&amp;t;  is the  leading  provider  of  domestic  and  international  long
distance  service to residential  consumers in the united states.  at&amp;t; provides
regular  and  custom  long  distance  communications  services  which it  offers
individually and in combination with other services.

         at&amp;t;    provides    interstate    and    intrastate    long    distance
telecommunications   services  throughout  the  continental  united  states  and
provides, or joins in providing with other carriers, telecommunications services
to and from alaska, hawaii, puerto rico and the virgin islands and international
telecommunications  services to and from  virtually all nations and  territories
around  the  world.  consumers  can use at&amp;t;  domestic  and  international  long
distance  services by the  traditional  "one plus"  dialing of the desired  call
destination, by dial-up access or through the use of at&amp;t; calling cards.

<page>

         at&amp;t; both delivers and receives  international  traffic pursuant to its
operating  agreements with foreign  carriers  throughout the world. the terms of
most switched voice  operating  agreements,  as well as established  fcc policy,
require  that inbound  switched  voice  traffic from the foreign  carrier to the
united states be routed to united states international  carriers,  like at&amp;t;, in
proportion to the  percentage of united states  outbound  traffic routed by that
united states international carrier to the foreign carrier.  at&amp;t;'s revenues and
costs of sales are sensitive to changes in  international  settlement  rates and
international traffic routing patterns.

         in  the  continental   united  states,   at&amp;t;  provides  long  distance
telecommunications   services  over  at&amp;t;'s  backbone   network.   international
telecommunications  services are provided by  submarine  cable  systems in which
at&amp;t; holds investment positions, satellites and facilities of other domestic and
foreign carriers.

         at&amp;t; markets its consumer long distance  services in a variety of ways,
including by means of  television  advertising,  direct mail  solicitations  and
telephonic solicitations, as well as through brand awareness.

         at&amp;t; charges  customers based on applicable  tariffs filed with the fcc
and individual states. customers select different services and from various rate
plans which  determine the price per minute that they pay on their long distance
calls.  rates  typically  vary based on a variety or factors,  particularly  the
volume of usage and the day and time that calls are made.

         consumer local services

         local  carriers  provide local  exchange,  exchange  access,  toll, and
resold  services;  and provide  operator and directory  services.  by the end of
1997,  at&amp;t; offered resold local service to  residential  customers in 8 states.
notwithstanding its substantial efforts, at&amp;t; experienced significant difficulty
in entering local markets.  at&amp;t;'s ability to purchase combined network elements
from the  incumbent  lecs  (ilecs),  one of the  primary  methods  by which at&amp;t;
intended to provide local service to residential customers, was severely limited
by, among other factors,  ilec-sponsored  regulatory and judicial actions, and a
lack of operating  interfaces  necessary to process  network element orders with
ilecs.  in spite of strong  demand,  in the fourth  quarter of 1997 at&amp;t; stopped
actively marketing resold local service to residential  customers in most of the
areas in which it offered such service  because of limitations on ilecs' ability
to handle  anticipated demand and because the wholesale rates at&amp;t; received from
ilecs on the sale of such  service  were  insufficient  to make  resale a viable
method of offering service.

         at&amp;t; intends to pursue local entry by transforming  the cable footprint
of one-way cable plant into a two-way,  broadband network capable of meeting the
full spectrum of communication needs of the residential  customer.  at&amp;t; intends
to deploy a variety of  services  over the  upgraded  cable  plant,  including a
richly featured all distance (i.e., local, long distance,  international)  voice
telephony offering. at&amp;t; has used existing circuit-switched  technology to pilot
telephony service offers over the cable plant beginning in 1999.  however,  at&amp;t;
expects to begin to transition to an  integrated  internet  protocol (ip) packet
data architecture by the end of 2000 that affords cost and feature benefits over
the older circuit-switched technology.

<page>

         in addition, at&amp;t; will pursue other transport options, including:

o        expanding  at&amp;t;'s ability to offer the full range of consumer  services
         our  existing  cable  footprint  through a variety of  partnership  and
         investment initiatives;

o        continued investment in alternative narrowband,  wideband and broadband
         access technologies,  including the fixed wireless technology that at&amp;t;
         is  currently  testing  in  select  markets,  and the  construction  of
         dedicated,  high-capacity  access  facilities  to serve  the  broadband
         communication  needs  of  residential   customers  living  in  multiple
         dwelling units (mdus); and

o        using combinations of ilec unbundled network elements,  as well as ilec
         unbundled  loops (which can be combined with  switching,  transport and
         other  network  elements)  to  support  differentiated  voice  and data
         services.

         at&amp;t; intends to use the at&amp;t; broadband  sales force actively to solicit
cable  customers as local  service  customers.  in these areas,  at&amp;t; intends to
offer cable and local telephony as a bundle of services.  at&amp;t; will market local
service in other areas as it rolls out its local telephony capabilities.

         for local service, customers are billed a fixed charge plus usage. at&amp;t;
intends  to offer  rates  competitive  with those  offered  by lecs,  as well as
discounted offers for certain bundles of services.

         at&amp;t; worldnet(r) consumer services

         at&amp;t;  offers  dial-up  internet  access to  consumers  through its at&amp;t;
worldnet  services,  a leading provider of direct internet access service in the
united states.  at december 31, 1999,  at&amp;t; worldnet  service had  approximately

search  engine as part of  redesign  of the  company's  web site,  and  enhanced
several other subscriber  features,  including increasing the disk storage space
for personal  web pages to 10  megabytes  for each e-mail id (six e-mail ids per
account,  60 megabytes  of disk  storage)  and  providing a template  that helps
members  build  personal web pages quickly and easily.  at&amp;t;  worldnet  services
entered into a co-marketing arrangement with sega, providing internet access via
sega's new dreamcast game machine, and it received recognition as the top isp in
the industry from pc week, pc magazine and smart money.

         at&amp;t;  worldnet  services   generates   revenues   principally   through
subscription and usage fees, as well as from electronic commerce and advertising
revenues.  at&amp;t;  worldnet  service  offers a variety  of pricing  plan  options,
including  bundled options.  generally,  customers are charged a flat rate for a
certain number of hours with charges for each additional hour of usage.

<page>

         at&amp;t; worldnet services'  marketing programs are designed to attract and
retain profitable customers.  at&amp;t; seeks to build brand recognition and customer
loyalty and to make it easy for  consumers to try, and stay with,  at&amp;t; worldnet
services. in addition to direct marketing through brand name advertising, direct
mail and magazine insert  promotions and bundling offers,  at&amp;t; worldnet service
maintains a large  indirect  channel  marketing  effort.  through this  indirect
channel at&amp;t; worldnet service  software is bundled in new computers  produced by
major manufacturers, and is included on millions of software titles published by
independent software vendors.

broadband services

                  at&amp;t; broadband  offers a variety of services through its cable
broadband network,  including  traditional analog video and new services such as
digital cable and  at&amp;t;@home,  which offers  high-speed  cable  internet  access
service.  also included in at&amp;t;  broadband are the  operations  associated  with
developing  and  refining  the   infrastructure   that  will  support  broadband
telephony.

         cable  television   systems  receive  video,  audio  and  data  signals
transmitted  by nearby  television  and radio  broadcast  stations,  terrestrial
microwave relay services and  communications  satellites.  such signals are then
amplified and  distributed by coaxial cable and optical fiber to the premises of
customers who pay a fee for the service. in many cases, cable television systems
also originate and distribute local programming.

         at december  31,  1999,  approximately  74% of at&amp;t;  broadband's  cable
television  systems had bandwidth  capacities  ranging from 450 megahertz to 750
megahertz.  the company's  cable  television  systems  generally  carry up to 80
analog channels.  compressed digital video technology converts on average twelve
analog  signals (now used to transmit video and voice) into a digital format and
compresses  such signals (which is  accomplished  primarily by  eliminating  the
redundancies  in  television  imagery) into the space  normally  occupied by one
analog signal. the digitally compressed signal is uplinked to a satellite, which
retransmits  the signal to a customer's  satellite  dish or to a cable  system's
headend  to be  distributed,  via  optical  fiber  and  coaxial  cable,  to  the
customer's  home.  at the home, a set-top  video  terminal  converts the digital
signal into analog channels that can be viewed on a normal television set.

         domestic   basic-tv  cable  customers  served  by  at&amp;t;  broadband  are
summarized as follows (amounts in millions):

         during 1999,  at&amp;t;  broadband  completed two  transactions  in which it
contributed  cable  television  systems  serving in the aggregate  approximately
863,000 customers to two separate joint ventures in exchange for non-controlling
ownership interests in such joint ventures,  and the assumption and repayment by
the joint ventures of indebtedness.

         the  decline  in  total  basic-tv  customers  between  1997 and 1998 is
attributable to certain  contribution  transactions entered into in 1998. in the
most  significant  of  these  transactions,  on march 4,  1998,  at&amp;t;  broadband
contributed  to  cablevision  systems  corporation  (csc)  certain  of its cable
television  systems  serving  approximately  830,000  customers  in exchange for
approximately  48.9  million  newly  issued csc class a common  shares  (the csc
transaction) and the assumption of indebtedness.

         in addition to the csc  transaction,  during 1998 at&amp;t;  broadband  also
completed eight transactions whereby at&amp;t; broadband contributed cable television
systems  serving in the  aggregate  approximately  1,924,000  customers to eight
separate joint ventures (collectively,  the 1998 joint ventures) in exchange for
non-controlling  ownership interests in each of the 1998 joint ventures, and the
assumption and repayment by the 1998 joint ventures of indebtedness.

         at&amp;t;  broadband had  approximately  1.8 million  digital  customers and
200,000 at&amp;t;@home customers at december 31, 1999.

         at&amp;t; broadband  operates cable television systems throughout the united
states.

         service  charges.  at&amp;t;  broadband  offers a  limited  "basic  service"
(basic-tv)   (primarily   comprised  of  local  broadcast  signals  and  public,
educational  and  governmental  (peg) access  channels)  and an "expanded  tier"
(primarily  comprised  of  specialized  programming  services,  in such areas as
health,  family  entertainment,   religion,   news,  weather,   public  affairs,
education,  shopping,  sports and  music).  the  monthly  fee for basic  service
generally  ranges  from $9.50 to $15.00,  and the  monthly  service  fee for the
expanded tier  generally  ranges from $15.00 to $21.50.  at&amp;t;  broadband  offers
"premium services" (referred to in the cable television industry as "pay-tv" and
"pay-per-view") to its customers.  such services consist  principally of feature
films, as well as live and taped sports events,  concerts and other programming.
at&amp;t;  broadband  also offers  pay-tv  services  for a monthly  fee.  charges are
usually discounted when multiple pay-tv services are ordered. customers may also
elect to subscribe to digital  video  services  comprised of up to 80 additional
video  channe;s  and  between  10 and 30  additional  audio  channels  featuring
additional   specialized   programming  and  premium   services  at  an  average
incremental monthly charge of $10.00.

         as further  enhancements to their cable services,  for a monthly charge
customers  may generally  rent  converters  or  converters  with remote  control
devices,  as well as purchase a channel guide. also a nonrecurring  installation
charge is usually charged.

         monthly fees for basic-tv and pay-tv  services to commercial  customers
vary widely depending on the nature and type of service.  except under the terms
of certain  contracts to provide service to commercial  accounts,  customers are
free to discontinue service at any time without penalty.

         at&amp;t;  broadband  also offers  at&amp;t;@home,  a high speed  cable  internet
access service, in some markets. monthly charges for at&amp;t;@home range from $29.95
to $39.95.

         the cable  television  consumer  protection and competition act of 1992
(the   1992   cable   act)  and  the   telecommunications   act  of  1996   (the
telecommunications  act,  together  with the 1992  cable act,  the cable  acts),
established  rules under which at&amp;t; broadband's  basic service and expanded tier
service  rates  and  equipment  and  installation  charges  are  regulated  if a
complaint is filed or if the appropriate franchise authority is certified.

         local  franchises.  cable television  systems generally are constructed
and operated under the authority of nonexclusive permits or "franchises" granted
by local and/or state governmental authorities. federal law, including the cable
communications  policy  act of 1984 (the 1984 cable act) and the 1992 cable act,
limits the power of the  franchising  authorities to impose  certain  conditions
upon cable  television  operators as a condition of the granting or renewal of a
franchise.

         franchises  contain varying  provisions  relating to  construction  and
operation of cable television systems,  such as time limitations on commencement
and/or  completion of  construction;  quality of service,  including (in certain
circumstances) requirements as to the number of channels and broad categories of
programming  offered to  customers;  rate  regulation;  provision  of service to
certain  institutions;  provision of channels for public  access and  commercial
leased-use;   and  maintenance  of  insurance  and/or   indemnity  bonds.   at&amp;t;
broadband's franchises also typically provide for periodic payments of fees, not
to exceed 5% of revenue,  to the governmental  authority granting the franchise.
additionally,  many franchises require payments to the franchising authority for
the funding of peg access  channels.  franchises  usually require the consent of
the franchising  authority prior to a transfer of the franchise or a transfer or
change in ownership or operating control of the franchisee.

         subject to applicable  law, a franchise may be terminated  prior to its
expiration  date if the  cable  television  operator  fails to  comply  with the
material terms and conditions thereof.  under the 1984 cable act, if a franchise
is lawfully terminated,  and if the franchising  authority acquires ownership of
the cable television system or effects a transfer of ownership to a third party,
such  acquisition or transfer must be at an equitable price or, in the case of a
franchise  existing  on the  effective  date of the 1984 cable  act,  at a price
determined in accordance with the terms of the franchise, if any.

         in connection with a renewal of a franchise,  the franchising authority
may require  the cable  operator to comply  with  different  and more  stringent
conditions than those originally imposed,  subject to the provisions of the 1984
cable act and other applicable federal, state and local law. the 1984 cable act,
as supplemented by the renewal provisions of the 1992 cable act,  establishes an
orderly  process for franchise  renewal which protects cable  operators  against
unfair denials of renewals when the operator's past performance and proposal for
future  performance  meet the standards  established by the 1984 cable act. at&amp;t;
broadband  believes  that its  cable  television  systems  generally  have  been
operated in a manner which  satisfies  such standards and allows for the renewal
of such franchises;  however,  there can be no assurance that the franchises for
such systems will be successfully renewed as they expire.

         most of at&amp;t;  broadband's  present  franchises  had  initial  terms  of
approximately  10 to 15 years.  the  duration  of at&amp;t;  broadband's  outstanding
franchises  presently varies from a period of months to an indefinite  period of
time.  approximately  one thousand of at&amp;t; broadband's  franchises expire within
the next five years. this represents approximately 25% percent of the franchises
held by at&amp;t; broadband and involves over 4 million basic customers.

business of the at&amp;t; wireless group

         the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  is  one  of the  largest  wireless  service
providers in the united states,  based on approximately $7.6 billion in revenues
for the year ended december 31, 1999.  including its  partnership  markets,  the
at&amp;t;  wireless  group had over 12 million total  subscribers  as of december 31,
1999.

         the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  operates  one of the  largest  u.s.  digital
wireless  networks.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group,  including its  partnership  and
affiliate markets,  currently holds 850 megahertz and 1900 megahertz licenses to

<page>

provide  wireless   services   covering  94%  of  the  u.s.   population,   with
approximately  81% of the u.s.  population  covered by at least 30  megahertz of
wireless  spectrum as of december  31, 1999.  as of december 31, 1999,  the at&amp;t;
wireless  group's built network,  including  partnership and affiliate  markets,
covered 65% of the u.s.  population.  this  includes  operations in 42 of the 50
largest u.s.  metropolitan  areas.  the at&amp;t; wireless group  supplements its own
operations  with  roaming  agreements  that allow its  subscribers  to use other
providers'  wireless  services in regions where the at&amp;t; wireless group does not
have operations.  through these roaming  agreements,  the at&amp;t; wireless group is
able to offer its  customers  wireless  services  covering  over 95% of the u.s.
population.

         services and products

         the at&amp;t; wireless group offers a variety of services for both voice and
data communications.  service can include wireless voice transmission as well as
custom  calling  services  for  digital  services,   such  as  voicemail,   call
forwarding,  call  waiting,  caller id,  three-way  calling,  no-answer and busy
transfer.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  also  offers a variety  of other  enhanced
features,  including display messaging, which allows a cellular phone to receive
and store short alphanumeric  messages and pages and to provide subscribers with
notification  of voicemail  messages,  even if the handset is in use or switched
off,  extended  battery life and enhanced  directory  assistance,  which enables
callers to be connected to the party whose number was sought without  hanging up
and redialing.

         as a  packet-switched  network,  the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  cellular
digital  packet data (cdpd)  network takes  advantage of the fact that with many
data applications, data is sent in bursts with intermittent quiet periods, which
allows many users to share the network  channel.  as a result,  relative to data
services carried over circuit-switched  analog or digital wireless networks, the
at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  packet-switched  cdpd service is a  significantly  more
cost-effective means of sending data for the majority of applications because it
allows a channel to be shared by many users. for example, for many applications,
the at&amp;t; wireless  group's  packet-switched  cdpd network allows it to offer its
customers  unlimited,  always-on usage,  most often for a flat monthly fee. this
makes its cdpd network service attractive for a variety of new applications.

         in the future,  the at&amp;t; wireless  group expects a number of additional
applications will be developed,  including  e-commerce and shopping services and
services  that are  enhanced  by  information  about  the  user's  location.  by
providing or facilitating such applications, the at&amp;t; wireless group believes it
can generate new revenue streams, as well as develop personalized  relationships
with its customers.

         the at&amp;t; wireless  group offers a variety of products as complements to
its wireless  service,  including  handsets and  accessories,  such as chargers,
headsets,  belt clips,  faceplates and  batteries.  as part of its basic service
offering, the at&amp;t; wireless group provides easy-to-use,  interactive menu-driven
handsets that can be activated over the air. these  handsets  primarily  feature
word prompts and menus rather than numeric codes to operate  handset  functions.
some  handsets  allow  mobile  access to the  internet.  in  addition,  the at&amp;t;
wireless group offers tri-mode handsets, which are handsets compatible with pcs,
digital  cellular and analog cellular  frequencies  and service modes.  tri-mode
handsets  permit  customers  to roam across a variety of wireless  networks  and
incorporates  at&amp;t;'s  intelligent  roaming  data base  (irdb)  system.  the at&amp;t;
wireless  group offers its  customers  use of nokia,  ericsson,  mitsubishi  and
motorola handsets.

         the at&amp;t; wireless  group  markets its wireless  services in its managed
markets under the at&amp;t; brand name. it markets wireless  services to business and
residential  customers  through a direct  sales  force of 2,100,  through  sales
points of presence in approximately 390 at&amp;t; company-owned  stores located in 36
states, and kiosks and other customer points of presence, including the internet
and  inbound  call  centers,  and  through  local  and  national  non-affiliated
retailers  throughout the united states. the at&amp;t; common stock group sales force
also sells wireless  services to business and  residential  customers as part of
bundled  offerings  with  services  of the at&amp;t;  common  stock  group.  the at&amp;t;
wireless  group  also  relies  upon  dealers  to  market  its  services  in some
locations.

         the  at&amp;t;   wireless   group  charges  may  include  fees  for  service
activation,  monthly access,  per-minute airtime and customer-calling  features,
which may  include a fixed  number of  minutes or packets of data per month at a
set price and  generally  offers a variety  of  pricing  options,  most of which
combine a fixed  monthly  access fee for a fixed number of minutes or packets of
data and additional charges for usage in excess of those allotted. customers may
also incur long distance and roaming fees.

         fixed wireless

         fixed wireless  service  provides  customers with high speed  broadband
access coupled with wireline  quality voice access.  fixed  wireless  provides a
high speed  packet  data  channel  which can be used by up to five data  devices
simultaneously (for example,  five personal computers  simultaneously  accessing
the internet) at download  speeds of up to 512 kilobits per second.  the service
is expected to be capable of speeds of up to one megabit per second by mid 2000.
in addition,  fixed  wireless  can provide up to four lines of wireline  quality
voice telephony,  including custom calling features (e.g., call waiting,  caller
id, three-way calling)  available today over wireline  networks.  fixed wireless
was reported within the consumer  services segment in 1999, but will be included
in the at&amp;t; wireless group in 2000.

         other assets

         the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  also  possesses  certain  other  assets  not
described above. the most significant of these assets include a number of equity
interests in domestic and international wireless operations and an air-to-ground
wireless operation.

         domestically,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  has  joint  ventures  with or
interests in a number of wireless operators,  including telecorp pcs, triton pcs
and tritel inc..  internationally,  the at&amp;t; wireless group owns one half of the
33.3%   equity   stake  in  rogers   cantel  it  holds   jointly   with  british
telecommunications. the at&amp;t; wireless group is the operating partner in wireless
ventures in colombia, india and taiwan. in 2000 the at&amp;t; wireless group was also
allocated  one half the  interest  that  at&amp;t;  possesses  in japan  telecom.  in
addition, subject to existing agreements or commitments, to the extent that at&amp;t;
acquires any  international  wireless  investments in connection with its merger
with mediaone,  at&amp;t; intends to allocate those  investments to the at&amp;t; wireless
group in exchange for fair and reasonable consideration.

         the aviation  communications  division (acd) of the at&amp;t; wireless group
provides air-to-ground communications services. a minority ownership interest in
acd is held by rogers  cantel.  acd owns and operates a network of  ground-based
and  airborne  telecommunications  equipment  and related  assets  that  deliver
digital telephone service to commercial and private aircraft in north america.

         wireless network

         the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  ownership  position  in u.s.  markets  was
obtained through fcc auctions and the fcc lottery and settlement process as well
as through  acquisitions of, and purchases and exchanges of, licenses with other
cellular providers.

         mobile voice network

         coverage.  as of december 31, 1999,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  built
network,  including  partnership and affiliate markets,  covered 65% of the u.s.
population,  including  operations  in 42 of the 50  largest  u.s.  metropolitan
areas.  the at&amp;t; wireless group provides  virtually  seamless  services over its
wireless  network,  which  operates  using both 850 megahertz and 1900 megahertz
licenses.  where  agreements  are in place,  the at&amp;t; wireless  group is able to
offer service to customers of other wireless  providers when they travel through
its service area,  and at&amp;t; wireless  group  subscribers  can roam through other
wireless providers' service areas.

         analog and digital  technologies.  the at&amp;t; wireless  group offers both
analog and digital  service in its 850 megahertz  markets and digital service in
its 1900  megahertz  markets.  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group  believes  that digital
technology   offers   many   advantages   over  analog   technology,   including
substantially  increased  network  capacity,   greater  call  privacy,  enhanced
services and features,  lower operating costs,  reduced  susceptibility to fraud
and the opportunity to provide improved data transmissions.  moving customers to
digital  service has been a key component of the at&amp;t; wireless  group's  overall
wireless  strategy.  digital  service enables the at&amp;t; wireless group to provide
added benefits and services to its customers,  including  extended battery life,
caller id, text messaging and voicemail with message waiting indicator.

         tdma network. the at&amp;t; wireless group has chosen time division multiple
access  (tdma)  technology  for its  digital  network.  tdma  permits the use of
advanced  tri-mode  handsets  that allow for roaming  across  analog and digital
systems and across 850  megahertz  and 1900  megahertz  spectrums.  tdma digital
technology allows for enhanced services and features, such as short alphanumeric
message  service,  extended battery life, added call security and improved voice
quality.  tdma's  hierarchical cell structure enables the at&amp;t; wireless group to
enhance  network  coverage  with  lower  incremental   investment   through  the
deployment of micro and pico, as opposed to macro,  cell sites. this enables the
at&amp;t; wireless  group to offer  customized  billing  options and to track billing
information per individual cell site,  which is practical for advanced  wireless
applications  such as fixed  wireless and  wireless  office  applications.  tdma
served an estimated 35 million subscribers  worldwide and 18 million subscribers
in north america as of december 31, 1999,  according to the  universal  wireless
communications   consortium,  an  association  of  tdma  service  providers  and
manufacturers.  tdma  equipment  is  available  from  leading  telecommunication
vendors such as lucent,  ericsson and nortel networks  corporation.  a number of
other wireless service  providers have chosen code division mobile access (cdma)
or global  system  for mobile  communications  (gsm) as their  digital  wireless
technology.

         cdpd network.  the at&amp;t; wireless group's cdpd network  currently covers
89 million pops,  which  represents over 60% of its built network,  and its cdpd
customers  can roam on the cdpd  networks of other  wireless  providers,  which,
together,  cover an  additional 72 million  pops.  cdpd is an industry  standard
using internet protocol, which allows most applications written for the internet
as well as many  corporate  applications  to run  efficiently  over the  network

<page>

without  modification.  using cdpd, data files and transactions are divided into
small  packets  and  sent  on  a  dedicated  wireless  channel.   in  many  data
applications,  data is sent in bursts with  intermittent  quiet periods.  packet
transmission  technologies take advantage of this fact and allow user data to be
efficiently carried on the same network channel.  as a result,  relative to data
services carried over circuit-switched  analog or digital wireless networks, the
at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  packet-switched  cdpd service is a  significantly  more
cost-effective means of sending data for the majority of applications because it
allows many users to share the same channel.

         international

         at&amp;t; has  established a number of  international  alliances to increase
the reach and scope of at&amp;t;'s services and network over time and has invested in
certain  countries  in order to increase  the range of  services  at&amp;t; offers in
those countries.

         international   operations  include   international   carrier  services
businesses,  international  online  services,  as well as  consolidated  foreign
operations such as frame relay services in the united  kingdom.  at&amp;t; also has a
number of international joint ventures and alliances, such as alestra in mexico,
at&amp;t; canada corp., and japan telecom.

         on january 6, 2000 at&amp;t; and british telecommunications plc (bt) created
a global venture to serve the  communications  needs of multinational  companies
and the international calling needs of businesses around the world. the venture,
called concert and owned equally by at&amp;t; and bt, combined transborder assets and
operations of each company,  including  their existing  international  networks,
their international  traffic,  their transborder products for business customers
- --  including  an  expanding  set of  concert  services  -- and  at&amp;t;  and  bt's
multinational accounts in selected industry sectors.

         on june 1, 1999, at&amp;t; canada corp. merged with metronet  communications
corp.,  canada's largest competitive local exchange carrier.  under the terms of
the merger  agreement,  at&amp;t;  received 31 percent of the equity  interest and 23
percent of the voting  interest  in the  combined  entity in  exchange  for at&amp;t;
canada corp. and acc  telenterprises  ltd. in addition,  at&amp;t; agreed to purchase

<page>

all of the  remaining  shares at the greater of the then  appraised  fair market
value or the accreted minimum price,  which initially is c$37.50 accreting after
june  30,  2000  at a rate  of  16%  per  annum,  compounded  quarterly.  if the
acquisition is not completed by june 30, 2003,  those shares,  along with at&amp;t;'s
shares,  would be sold  through an auction  process and at&amp;t; will make whole the
other  shareholders  for the amount they would have been entitled to if at&amp;t; had
purchased  the  shares.  the  completion  of the  acquisition  is subject to the
condition  that at&amp;t; is permitted to acquire the shares under  canada's  foreign
ownership  restrictions.  at&amp;t; may acquire  the shares  prior to a change in the
ownership  restrictions  by developing a structure that addresses such ownership
restrictions.

legislative and regulatory developments

         telecommunications act of 1996

         in  february   1996,  the   telecommunications   act  became  law.  the
telecommunications  act,  among  other  things,  was  designed  to foster  local
exchange  competition  by  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  to govern new
competitive entry in local and long distance  telecommunications  services.  the
telecommunications act will permit the regional bell operating companies (rbocs)
to provide  interexchange  services originating in any state in its region after
demonstrating  to the fcc that such  provision  is in the  public  interest  and
satisfying the conditions for developing  local  competition  established by the
telecommunications act.

         in  august  1996,  the fcc  adopted  rules and  regulations,  including
pricing  rules  (the  "pricing  rules")  to  implement  the  local   competition
provisions of the  telecommunications  act,  including with respect to the terms
and conditions of interconnection  with lec networks and the standards governing
the purchase of unbundled  network  elements and  wholesale  services from lecs.
these  implementing  rules rely on state public utilities  commissions (pucs) to
develop the specific rates and procedures applicable to particular states within
the framework prescribed by the fcc.

         on july 18,  1997,  the  united  states  court of  appeals  for the 8th
circuit  issued a decision  holding  that the fcc lacks  authority  to establish
pricing rules to implement the sections of the local  competition  provisions of
the  telecommunications  act applicable to interconnection with lec networks and
the purchase of unbundled  network  elements and  wholesale  services from lecs.
accordingly,  the court  vacated  the rules  that the fcc had  adopted in august
1996,  and which had been stayed by the court since  september  1996. on october
14,  1997,  the 8th  circuit  court of  appeals  vacated  an fcc  rule  that had
prohibited  incumbent lecs from separating network elements that are combined in
the lec's  network,  except at the  request  of the  competitor  purchasing  the
elements.  this  decision  increased  the  difficulty  and  costs  of  providing
competitive  local  service  through  the  use  of  unbundled  network  elements
purchased from the incumbent lecs.

         on january 25, 1999,  the unites states supreme court issued a decision
reversing  the 8th  circuit  court  of  appeal's  holding  that  the  fcc  lacks
jurisdiction to establish  pricing rules applicable to  interconnection  and the
purchase of unbundled  network  elements,  and the court of appeal's decision to
vacate  the  fcc's  rule  prohibiting  incumbent  lecs from  separating  network
elements  that are  combined  in the lec's  network.  the effect of the  supreme
court's  decision  is to  reinstate  the fcc's rules  governing  pricing and the
separation of unbundled network elements.  the 8th circuit court of appeals will

<page>

now consider the incumbent  lecs' claims that although the fcc has  jurisdiction
to  adopt  pricing  rule,  the  rules it  adopted  are not  consistent  with the
applicable  provisions of the act. the supreme court also vacated the fcc's rule
identifying and defining the unbundled  network elements that incumbent lecs are
required to make  available to new  entrants,  and directed the fcc to reexamine
this issue in light of the standards mandated by the act.

         in response to the supreme  court's  decision,  the fcc  completed  its
re-examination  of and released an order  identifying and defining the unbundled
network  elements  that  incumbent  lecs are  required to make  available to new
entrants.  that order  re-adopted  the original  list of elements,  with certain
exceptions. an association of incumbent lecs has appealed the fcc's order to the
united states court of appeals for the district of columbia  circuit,  and asked
the  court to hear the  appeal  on an  expedited  basis.  a number  of  parties,
including at&amp;t; and other  incumbent  lecs, have petitioned the fcc to reconsider
and/or  clarify  its  order.  the fcc has moved to hold the  appeal in  abeyance
pending its disposition of the reconsideration petitions.

         in view of the proceedings  pending before the 8th circuit, dc circuit,
fcc and  state  pucs,  there  can be no  assurance  that the  prices  and  other
conditions  established  in each state will provide for effective  local service
entry and competition or provide at&amp;t; with new market opportunities.

         in  december  1999,  bell  atlantic  obtained  approval  to offer  long
distance  telecommunications  service in new york state,  the first time an rboc
had received this approval under the telecommunications act. bell atlantic began
offering combined local and long distance service in january 2000.

         in  january  2000,  sbc  communications,  inc.  filed  with  the fcc an
application for authorization to offer long distance  telecommunications service
in texas.  under the  telecommunications  act,  the fcc is  required  to issue a
decision on the application by april 2000.

         modification of final judgment of 1982

         prior to 1996, at&amp;t; and the rbocs were subject to the provisions of the
modification  of final  judgment  of 1982 (mfj)  since its  implementation.  the
telecommunications  act  effectively  superseded  future  operation  of the mfj.
consequently, on april 11, 1996, judge harold greene issued an order terminating
the mfj.
         regulation of rates

         at&amp;t;  is  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of the  fcc  with  respect  to
interstate and international rates, lines and services,  and other matters. from
july 1989 to october 1995, the fcc regulated at&amp;t; under a system known as "price
caps" whereby at&amp;t;'s prices, rather than its earnings,  were limited. on october
12, 1995,  recognizing a decade of enormous  change in the long distance  market
and finding  that at&amp;t;  lacked  market  power in the  interstate  long  distance
market,  the fcc reclassified at&amp;t; as a "non-dominant"  carrier for its domestic
interstate services. as a result, at&amp;t; became subject to the same regulations as
its long  distance  competitors  for such  services.  thus,  at&amp;t; was no  longer
subject to price cap  regulation  for these  services,  was able to file tariffs
that are presumed lawful on one day's notice,  and was free of other regulations
and reporting requirements that apply only to dominant carriers.

         in addition,  on october 31,  1996,  the fcc issued an order that would
have prohibited  non-dominant carriers,  including at&amp;t;, from filing tariffs for

<page>

their domestic interstate services.  at&amp;t; and other parties have filed an appeal
of the fcc's order with the united states court of appeals for the d.c. circuit.
in february 1997, the d.c.  circuit stayed the  effectiveness of the fcc's order
pending appeal.  oral argument has not yet been scheduled.  if the court affirms
the fcc's order and lifts the stay, non-dominant carriers,  including at&amp;t;, will
have to  utilize  mechanisms  other  than  tariffs  to  establish  the terms and
conditions that apply to domestic, interstate telecommunications services.

         furthermore,  in may 1997,  the fcc adopted  three  orders  relating to
price caps, access reform, and universal service that substantially  revised the
level and structure of access charges that at&amp;t; as a long distance  carrier pays
to incumbent  lecs.  at&amp;t; has agreed to pass through to consumers any savings to
at&amp;t; as a  result  of  access  charge  reform.  at&amp;t;  began  implementing  these
reductions july 15, 1997. consequently,  at&amp;t;'s results after june 1997 reflects
lower  revenue  per minute of usage and lower  access and other  interconnection
costs per minute of usage.

         the price cap order  requires lecs to reduce their price cap indices by
6.5 percent  annually,  less an  adjustment  for  inflation,  which is likely to
result in a  reduction  in the  interstate  access  charges  that long  distance
carriers, such as at&amp;t;, pay to lecs. the access charge reform order restructured
access  charges  so that  certain  costs  that do not vary  with  usage  will be
recovered on a flat-rate basis and permitted increased flat-rate  assessments on
multiline  business  customers  and on  residential  lines  beyond  the  primary
telephone line. this restructuring allows a reduction in access charges assessed
on long distance carriers on a usage basis. finally, the universal service order
(which represents an fcc mandated  contribution to support schools and libraries
and rural  health  care  programs,  high cost  support  and low  income  support
mechanisms  which  are paid to the  universal  service  administrative  company)
adopts a new  mechanism for funding  universal  service which expands the set of
carriers  that must  contribute  to  support  universal  service  from only long
distance  carriers to all  carriers,  including  lecs,  that provide  interstate
telecommunications  services.  similarly,  the set of carriers  eligible for the
universal  service  support  has been  expanded  from only lecs to any  eligible
carrier  providing local service to a customer,  including at&amp;t; as a new entrant
in local markets.  the universal  service order also adopted measures to provide
discounts on  telecommunications  services,  internet  access and inside wire to
eligible schools and libraries and rural health carrier providers.

         at&amp;t; remains  subject to the statutory  requirements of title ii of the
communications  act. at&amp;t; must offer service under rates,  terms and  conditions
that are just, reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory;  it is subject to
the fcc's  complaint  process,  and it must give notice to the fcc and  affected
customers prior to discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service. at&amp;t; has
also made certain  commitments  that address  concerns that had been raised with
regard to the potential impact of declaring at&amp;t; to be non-dominant, including a
three-year rate assurance for low income and low usage  residential  users and a
three-year  limit on, and 5 days  advance  notice  for,  rate  increases  on 800
directory assistance and analog private line services.

         at&amp;t;'s  international  private line  services  have been  classified as
non-dominant  for several years.  at&amp;t;'s  switched  international  services have
become subject to increased competition, similar to its domestic services and on
may 9, 1996,  the fcc  adopted  an order  reclassifying  at&amp;t; as a  non-dominant
carrier for such  services.  at&amp;t; has made certain  voluntary  commitments  that
address issues raised in that proceeding, including commitments: (i) to maintain
its annual average revenue per minute for international  residential calls at or

<page>

below the 1995  level  through  may 9, 1999,  and in the event of a  significant
change that substantially  raises at&amp;t;'s costs, to provide the fcc five business
days notice prior to  implementing  rate  increases  that would raise the annual
average  revenue  per minute for such calls  above the 1995  level;  and (ii) to
maintain  certain  discount  calling plans providing at least a 15% discount off
basic pricing schedules until may 9, 1999. at&amp;t; also made voluntary  commitments
relating to its operation of international cable facilities,  its negotiation of
settlement  agreements with foreign carriers and its  relationship  with foreign
partners.

         in  addition  to  the  matters  described  above  with  respect  to the
telecommunications  act, state public service commissions or similar authorities
having  regulatory  power over  intrastate  rates,  lines and services and other
matters regulate at&amp;t;'s local and intrastate communications services. the system
of regulation used in many states is rate-of-return regulation. in recent years,
many states have adopted  different  systems of  regulation,  such as:  complete
removal of rate-of-return regulation,  pricing flexibility rules, price caps and
incentive regulation.

         wireless regulatory environment

         the fcc regulates the licensing, construction,  operation, acquisition,
sale and  resale of  wireless  systems  in the  united  states  pursuant  to the
communications  act of 1934 and the associated  rules,  regulations and policies
promulgated by the fcc.

licensing of wireless services systems

         the at&amp;t; wireless group owns protected geographic service area licenses
granted by the fcc to provide  cellular  service and pcs. it also owns  licenses
granted by the fcc to provide  point-to-multi-point  communications  services in
various bands, including significant licenses in the 37 to 39 gigahertz bands.

         a cellular system operates on one of two 25 megahertz  frequency blocks
that the fcc allocates for cellular radio service.  cellular  systems  generally
are used for two-way  mobile voice  applications,  although they may be used for
data  applications and fixed wireless  services as well.  cellular license areas
are  issued  for  either  metropolitan  service  areas or rural  service  areas.
initially,  one of the two  cellular  licenses  available  in each  metropolitan
service  area or rural  service area was awarded to a local  exchange  telephone
company  by the  fcc,  while  the  other  license  was  awarded  either  through
competitive processes or lotteries.  licenses were issued beginning in 1983, and
over the years numerous  license  transfers and corporate  reorganizations  have
obscured  the  original  pattern of  distributing  one set of  licenses to local
telephone  company  affiliates and the other to companies that do not have local
exchange service in the license area.

         a pcs system  operates on one of six  frequency  blocks  allocated  for
personal  communications  services.  pcs systems  generally are used for two-way
voice applications  although they may carry two-way data communications as well.
narrowband  pcs systems,  in contrast,  are for non-voice  applications  such as
paging and data service and are separately licensed. for the purpose of awarding
pcs  licenses,  the fcc has  segmented  the united  states into 51 large regions
called major trading  areas,  which are comprised of 493 smaller  regions called
basic  trading  areas.  the fcc awarded two pcs licenses for each major  trading
area and four  licenses  for each  basic  trading  area.  thus,  generally,  six
licensees  are  authorized  to compete in each area.  the two major trading area

<page>

licenses authorize the use of 30 megahertz of spectrum. one of the basic trading
area  licenses is for 30 megahertz  of spectrum,  and the other three are for 10
megahertz  each. the fcc permits  licensees to split their licenses and assign a
portion, on either a geographic or frequency basis or both, to a third party.

         the fcc awarded  initial pcs licenses by auction.  auctions  began with
the 30 megahertz major trading area licenses and concluded in 1998 with the last
of the basic trading area licenses.  however,  in march 1998, the fcc adopted an
order that allows troubled  entities that won pcs 30 megahertz  c-block licenses
at auction to obtain  financial  relief from their  payment  obligations  and to
return some or all of their c-block  licenses to the fcc for  reauctioning.  the
fcc completed the reauction of the returned licenses in april 1999. in addition,
certain of the c-block  licenses are  currently in bankruptcy  proceedings,  and
these licenses may be returned to the fcc for reauction.

         under the fcc's current rules specifying  spectrum  aggregation  limits
affecting  wireless  licensees,  no  entity  may  hold  attributable  interests,
generally 20% or more of the equity of, or an officer or director position with,
the  licensee,  in licenses  for more than 45  megahertz  of pcs,  cellular  and
certain  specialized mobile radio services where there is significant overlap in
any  geographic  area.  significant  overlap will occur when at least 10% of the
population  of the pcs  licensed  service  area is within  the  cellular  and/or
specialized mobile radio service area(s).  the fcc recently increased this limit
to 55 megahertz in  situations  in which a 25 megahertz  cellular  rural service
area is  attributed to a 30 megahertz pcs license.  these  spectrum  aggregation
rules are subject to a pending fcc  proceeding  that could  revise or  eliminate
them.

         all wireless  licenses  have a 10-year  term,  at the end of which term
they must be  renewed.  the fcc will  award a renewal  expectancy  to a wireless
licensee that has provided substantial service during its past license term, and
has  substantially  complied  with  applicable  fcc rules and  policies  and the
communications  act.  licenses  may be  revoked  for cause and  license  renewal
applications  denied if the fcc  determines  that a renewal  would not serve the
public  interest.  fcc rules provide that  competing  renewal  applications  for
licenses  will  be  considered  in  comparative  hearings,   and  establish  the
qualifications  for  competing  applications  and the standards to be applied in
hearings.

         all wireless  licenses must satisfy  specified  coverage  requirements.
cellular  licenses were required,  during the five years  following the grant of
the  license,  to  construct  their  systems to provide  service (at a specified
signal strength) to the territory  encompassed by their service area. failure to
provide such coverage  resulted in reduction of the relevant license area by the
fcc.  all a and b block pcs  licensees  must  construct  facilities  that  offer
coverage to one-third of the population of the service area within five years of
the original  license  grants and to  two-thirds  of the  population  within ten
years.  all d and e block pcs licensees  must  construct  facilities  that offer
coverage to one-fourth of the population of the licensed area or "make a showing
of substantial  service in their license area" within five years of the original
license  grants.  licensees that fail to meet the coverage  requirements  may be
subject to forfeiture of the license.

         for a period of up to five  years  after  the  grant of a pcs  license,
subject to  extension,  a  licensee  will be  required  to share  spectrum  with
existing  licensees  that operate  certain fixed  microwave  systems  within its
license area under circumstances where  interconnection is not available through

<page>

the local exchange  carrier or the  competitive  local exchange  carrier.  in an
effort to balance the competing  interests of existing microwave users and newly
authorized pcs licensees, the fcc has adopted a transition plan to relocate such
microwave  operators to other spectrum blocks and a cost sharing plan so that if
the  relocation  of an  incumbent  benefits  more than one pcs  licensee,  those
licensees will share the cost of the relocation. initially, this transition plan
allowed  most  microwave  users to operate in the pcs  spectrum  for a voluntary
two-year  negotiation period and an additional  mandatory  one-year  negotiation
period.  for public  safety  entities  that  dedicate a majority of their system
communications  to police,  fire or emergency medical services  operations,  the
voluntary  negotiation  period  is three  years,  with an  additional  mandatory
two-year   negotiation   period.  in  1998,  the  fcc  shortened  the  voluntary
negotiation  period by one year, without  lengthening the mandatory  negotiation
period, for non-public safety pcs licensees in the c, d, e and f blocks. parties
unable to reach agreement  within these time periods may refer the matter to the
fcc for  resolution,  but the incumbent  microwave user is permitted to continue
its operations until final fcc resolution of the matter. the transition and cost
sharing  plans  expire  on april 4,  2005,  at which  time  remaining  microwave
incumbents in the pcs spectrum will be  responsible  for the costs of relocating
to alternate spectrum locations.

         wireless  systems are subject to certain faa regulations  governing the
location,  lighting and construction of transmitter  towers and antennas and are
subject  to  regulation   under  federal   environmental   laws  and  the  fcc's
environmental  regulations.  state or local zoning and land use regulations also
apply to tower  siting  and  construction  activities.  we expect to use  common
carrier  point-to-point  microwave  facilities to connect certain  wireless cell
sites,  and to link them to the main  switching  office.  the fcc licenses these
facilities  separately  and they  are  subject  to  regulation  as to  technical
parameters and service.

         the communications act preempts state and local regulation of the entry
of, or the rates charged by, any provider of private  mobile radio service or of
commercial mobile radio service,  which includes pcs and cellular  service.  the
fcc does not regulate  commercial  mobile radio service or private  mobile radio
service rates.  however,  commercial  mobile radio service  providers are common
carriers and are required under the  communications  act to offer their services
to the public without  unreasonable  discrimination.  the fcc's rules  currently
require  providers  to  permit  others to resell  their  services  for a profit;
however, these rules will expire in 2002.

         transfers and assignments of cellular and pcs
licenses

         the  communications  act and fcc rules require the fcc's prior approval
of the  assignment  or  transfer  of control of a license  for a pcs or cellular
system. in addition,  the fcc has established  transfer disclosure  requirements
that require  licensees who assign or transfer  control of a pcs license  within
the first three years of their license terms to file  associated sale contracts,
option agreements, management agreements or other documents disclosing the total
consideration  that the  licensee  would  receive in return for the  transfer or
assignment of its license.  non-controlling interests in an entity that holds an
fcc license  generally may be bought or sold without fcc approval subject to the
fcc's  spectrum  aggregation  limits.  however,  notification  and expiration or
earlier  termination  of the  applicable  waiting period under section 7a of the
clayton act by either the federal trade  commission or the department of justice
may be required,  as well as approval by state or local  regulatory  authorities

<page>

having competent  jurisdiction,  if we sell or acquire pcs or cellular interests
over a certain size.

         foreign ownership

         under existing law, no more than 20% of an fcc licensee's capital stock
may be owned,  directly or  indirectly,  or voted by non-u.s.  citizens or their
representatives,  by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign
corporation.  if an fcc licensee is controlled by another entity, as is the case
with our ownership  structure,  up to 25% of that entity's  capital stock may be
owned or voted by  non-u.s.  citizens  or their  representatives,  by a  foreign
government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. foreign ownership
above the 25% level may be allowed  should the fcc find such  higher  levels not
inconsistent  with the public interest.  the fcc has ruled that higher levels of
foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public
interest  with  respect  to  investors  from  certain  nations.  if our  foreign
ownership  were to exceed  the  permitted  level,  the fcc could  revoke our fcc
licenses,  although we could seek a declaratory ruling from the fcc allowing the
foreign  ownership  or take  other  actions  to  reduce  our  foreign  ownership
percentage in order to avoid the loss of our  licenses.  we have no knowledge of
any present foreign ownership in violation of these restrictions.

         recent regulatory developments

         the fcc has announced rules for making emergency 911 services available
by cellular, pcs and other commercial mobile radio service providers,  including
enhanced 911 services that provide the caller's  telephone number,  location and
other useful  information.  the original  timetable  required  commercial mobile
radio  services  providers to be able to process and transmit 911 calls  without
call   validation,   including   those  from  callers  with  speech  or  hearing
disabilities,  by late  1997.  additionally,  commercial  mobile  radio  service
providers  are  required  to take  actions  enabling  them to  relay a  caller's
automatic number  identification and cell site if requested to do so by a public
safety  dispatch agency that agreed to reimburse the provider for the additional
expenses  incurred to provide those  services.  in october 1999, the fcc revised
its rules to eliminate any  requirement  that such agencies  reimburse  wireless
providers. in a companion order issued earlier in the fall of 1999, the fcc also
modified rules requiring  commercial  mobile radio service  providers to provide
information on the location of a 911 call. the modified rules allow providers to
use either network or  handset-based  technologies to provide such  information.
however,  providers are not  permitted to recover their costs of deploying  such
technologies from dispatch agencies.

         the fcc has granted  waivers of the  requirement to provide 911 service
to users with speech or hearing  disabilities to various providers,  and we have
obtained a waiver.  on june 9, 1999,  the fcc also  adopted  rules  designed  to
ensure that analog  cellular calls to 911 are completed.  these rules,  which do
not apply to digital cellular  service or to pcs, give each cellular  provider a
choice of three ways to meet this requirement.  state actions  incompatible with
the fcc rules are subject to preemption.

         on  august  8,  1996,  the fcc  released  its  order  implementing  the
interconnection  provisions of the telecommunications  act. although many of the
provisions  of this order were struck down by the u.s.  court of appeals for the
eighth circuit,  on january 25, 1999, the u.s. supreme court reversed the eighth
circuit and upheld the fcc in all respects  material to our operations.  on june
10, 1999, the eighth circuit issued an order requesting briefs on certain issues

<page>

it did not  address in its  earlier  order,  including  the  pricing  regime for
interconnection.  while  appeals have been  pending,  the rationale of the fcc's
order has been  adopted by many states'  public  utility  commissions,  with the
result that the charges that  cellular  and pcs  operators  pay to  interconnect
their  traffic  to  the  public   switched   telephone   network  have  declined
significantly from pre-1996 levels.

         in  its   implementation  of  the   telecommunications   act,  the  fcc
established federal universal service requirements that affect commercial mobile
radio service operators.  under the fcc's rules, commercial mobile radio service
providers are potentially  eligible to receive  universal  service subsidies for
the first time;  however,  they are also  required to  contribute to the federal
universal  service  fund and can be required to  contribute  to state  universal
funds.  many states also are moving forward to develop state  universal  service
fund  programs.  a number of these state funds  require  contributions,  varying
greatly from state to state, from commercial mobile radio service providers. the
fcc's  universal  service  order was  modified  on  appeal in the u.s.  court of
appeals for the fifth circuit. the court's ruling has had the effect of reducing
commercial  mobile radio  service  provider  support  payments  required for the
federal universal service programs.

         on august 1, 1996,  the fcc released a report and order  expanding  the
flexibility of cellular, pcs and other commercial mobile radio service providers
to provide fixed as well as mobile services.  these fixed services include,  but
need not be limited to, wireless local loop services,  for example, to apartment
and office buildings, and wireless backup services to private branch exchange or
switchboards  and local area networks,  to be used in the event of interruptions
due to weather or other  emergencies.  the fcc has not yet decided whether fixed
services provided on a co-primary basis to mobility services should be subjected
to  universal  service  obligations,  or  how  such  fixed  services  should  be
regulated,  but  it has  proposed  a  presumption  that  they  be  regulated  as
commercial mobile radio service services.  if the fixed services are provided as
an ancillary service to a carrier's mobility services,  the fcc has decided that
such fixed services should be regulated as commercial mobile radio services.

         the fcc has adopted  rules on telephone  number  portability  that will
enable  customers to migrate their  landline and cellular  telephone  numbers to
cellular or pcs providers and from a cellular or pcs provider to another service
provider. on february 8, 1999, the fcc extended the deadline for compliance with
this requirement to november 24, 2002,  subject to any later  determination that
number portability is necessary to conserve telephone numbers.  the fcc has also
adopted  rules  requiring  cellular and pcs  providers  to provide  functions to
facilitate  electronic  surveillance  by law  enforcement  officials by june 30,
2000,  and has  proposed  to adopt  certain  additional  obligations  furthering
provision of these functions.  representatives  of the cellular and pcs industry
are  challenging  the  surveillance  rules.  additionally,  it is not clear that
commercial mobile radio service providers will be able to comply with the rules'
compatibility  requirements by the current  deadline of june 30, 2000; nor is it
clear  whether  the fcc will grant  waivers to extend the  deadline  or what the
scope of penalties for failing to comply may be.

         the fcc has determined  that the interstate,  interexchange  offerings,
commonly  referred to as long  distance,  of  commercial  mobile  radio  service
providers  are  subject to the  interstate,  interexchange  rate  averaging  and
integration  provisions of the communications act. rate averaging requires us to
average our  interstate  long  distance  commercial  mobile radio  service rates
between high cost and urban  areas.  the fcc has delayed  implementation  of the

<page>

rate  integration  requirements  with  respect  to wide area rate plans we offer
pending  further  reconsideration  of  its  rules.  the  fcc  also  delayed  the
requirement  to integrate  commercial  mobile radio service long distance  rates
among commercial mobile radio service affiliates.  on december 31, 1998, the fcc
reaffirmed,  on  reconsideration,  that its interexchange rate integration rules
apply  to  interexchange  commercial  mobile  radio  service  services.  the fcc
announced it would  initiate a further  proceeding to determine how  integration
requirements  apply  to  typical  commercial  mobile  radio  service  offerings,
including one-rate plans.  until this further  proceeding is concluded,  the fcc
will enforce  long  distance  rate  integration  on our  services  only where we
separately  state a long distance toll charge and bill to our customers.  to the
extent that the at&amp;t; wireless  group offers  services  subject to the fcc's rate
integration and averaging requirements,  these requirements generally reduce its
pricing  flexibility.  we cannot  assure you that the fcc will decline to impose
rate integration or averaging requirements on the at&amp;t; wireless group or decline
to require it to integrate  its  commercial  mobile radio  service long distance
rates across its commercial mobile radio service affiliates.

         the fcc  recently  adopted  new  rules  limiting  the  use of  customer
proprietary  network information by  telecommunications  carriers in marketing a
broad range of telecommunications  and other services to their customers and the
customers  of  affiliated  companies.  the rules were struck down by the federal
circuit  court in 1999,  and their  effectiveness  has been  stayed  pending the
court's review of a petition to the fcc for  reconsideration.  even if the rules
are  reinstated,  the at&amp;t;  wireless  group does not  anticipate  that they will
result in a significant  adverse  impact on its financial  position,  results of
operation or liquidity.

         in addition,  state commissions have become increasingly  aggressive in
their efforts to conserve numbering resources. these efforts may impact wireless
service providers  disproportionately  by imposing  additional costs or limiting
access to numbering  resources.  examples of state conservation methods include:
number  pooling,  number  rationing  and code  sharing.  a number of states have
petitioned the fcc for authority to adopt  "technology  specific"  overlays that
would require wireless  providers to obtain telephone  numbers out of a separate
area  code  and may  require  wireless  providers  to  change  their  customers'
telephone numbers. the fcc approval and the states' subsequent implementation of
such "technology  specific overlays" could increase wireless  providers' cost of
doing business and impact their ability to market services. on june 2, 1999, the
fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting comments on a variety of
administrative   and  technical  measures  that  would  promote  more  efficient
allocation  and use of  numbering  resources.  adoption of some of the  proposed
methods could have a disproportionate impact on commercial mobile radio services
providers.

         the fcc is also  considering  adopting rules to govern customer billing
by  commercial  mobile radio  services  providers  and applied a number of these
rules to commercial  mobile radio service  providers.  the fcc adopted  detailed
billing  rules  for  landline   telecommunications   service  providers  and  is
considering  whether to extend the remaining  rules to  commercial  mobile radio
services providers.  the fcc may require that more billing detail be provided to
consumers,  which could add to the expense of the billing process as systems are
modified to conform to any new requirements. the fcc also is considering whether
carriers  that  decide  to  pass  through  their  mandatory   universal  service
contributions   to  their  customers  should  be  required  to  provide  a  full
explanation  of the program,  and whether to ensure that the carriers  that pass
through their  contribution  do not recover amounts greater than their mandatory

<page>

contributions  from their  customers.  adoption  of some of the fcc's  proposals
could increase the complexity of our billing  processes and restrict our ability
to bill customers for services in the most commercially advantageous way.

         the fcc has  adopted  an  order  that  determines  the  obligations  of
telecommunications  carriers to make their  services  accessible to  individuals
with disabilities.  the order requires  telecommunications services providers to
offer  equipment and services that are accessible to and useable by persons with
disabilities.  while the rules exempt  telecommunications  carriers from meeting
general  disability  access   requirements  if  such  results  are  not  readily
achievable,  it is not clear how liberally the fcc will construe this exemption.
accordingly,  the rules  require us to make  material  changes  to our  network,
product line, or services at our expense.

         in june 1999, the fcc initiated an administrative rulemaking proceeding
to help  facilitate  the offering of calling party pays as an optional  wireless
service.  under the calling party pays service,  the party placing the call to a
wireless customer pays the wireless airtime charges.  most wireless customers in
the united states now pay both to place calls and to receive them. adoption of a
calling  party pays system on a widespread  basis could make  commercial  mobile
radio   service   providers   more   competitive   with   traditional   landline
telecommunications providers for the provision of regular telephone service.

         state regulation and local approvals

         state and local governments are preempted from regulating either market
entry by, or the rates of, wireless  operators.  however,  state governments can
regulate other terms and conditions of wireless  service and several states have
imposed  (or have  proposed  legislation  that  will  impose)  various  consumer
protection  regulations on the wireless  industry.  states also may impose their
own universal  service support regimes on wireless and other  telecommunications
carriers,  similar to the requirements that have been established by the fcc. at
the local level,  wireless  facilities  typically are subject to zoning and land
use regulation. state and local jurisdictions may also impose some conditions on
a driver's use of wireless technology while operating a motor vehicle.  however,
under the federal  telecommunications  act, neither local nor state  governments
may  categorically  prohibit  the  construction  of wireless  facilities  in any
community.

         cable regulation and legislation

         the operation of cable television  systems is extensively  regulated by
the  fcc,   some   state   governments   and   most   local   governments.   the
telecommunications  act  removes  barriers  to  competition  in both  the  cable
television  market and the local telephone market and reduces the scope of cable
rate regulation.

         the  telecommunications  act  required  the fcc to  implement  numerous
rulemakings,  the final outcome of which cannot yet be  determined  due to court
challenges. moreover, congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject
of cable  television  regulation  and may do so again.  future  legislative  and
regulatory  changes could adversely  affect at&amp;t;  broadband's  operations.  this
section  briefly  summarizes key laws and  regulations  currently  affecting the
growth and operation of at&amp;t; broadband's cable systems.

         cable rate  regulation.  the 1992 cable act imposed an  extensive  rate
regulation regime on the cable television industry, which limited the ability of

<page>

cable  companies  to increase  subscriber  fees.  under that  regime,  all cable
systems  were  subjected  to  rate  regulation,  unless  they  faced  "effective
competition" in their local franchise area.  federal law now defines  "effective
competition"  on  a  community-specific   basis  as  requiring  satisfaction  of
conditions rarely satisfied in the current marketplace.

         although the fcc  establishes  all cable rate rules,  local  government
units  (commonly  referred  to as local  franchising  authorities  or lfas)  are
primarily  responsible for  administering  the regulation of the lowest level of
cable -- the basic service tier (bst),  which typically contains local broadcast
stations and peg access channels.  before an lfa begins bst rate regulation,  it
must certify to the fcc that it will follow  applicable  federal rules, and many
lfas have  voluntarily  declined  to  exercise  this  authority.  lfas also have
primary  responsibility for regulating cable equipment rates. under federal law,
charges for various types of cable  equipment  must be unbundled from each other
and from monthly charges for programming services, and priced no higher than the
operator's actual cost, plus an 11.25% rate of return.

         the  fcc  historically   administered  rate  regulation  of  any  cable
programming  service tiers (cpst),  which typically contain  satellite-delivered
programming.  under the  telecommunications  act, the fcc's  ability to regulate
cpst rates  expired on march 31, 1999.  the fcc has taken the  position  that it
will  adjudicate  pending cpst complaints but will strictly limit its review and
possible refund orders to the time period predating march 31, 1999.

         cable  entry  into   telecommunications.   the  telecommunications  act
provides  that no state or local laws or  regulations  may  prohibit or have the
effect of  prohibiting  any entity from  providing any  interstate or intrastate
telecommunications   service.   states  are  authorized,   however,   to  impose
"competitively  neutral" requirements regarding universal service, public safety
and  welfare,  service  quality,  and  consumer  protection.   state  and  local
governments  also retain  their  authority  to manage the public  rights-of-way.
although the  telecommunications  act clarifies that traditional cable franchise
fees may be based only on revenues  related to the provision of cable television
services,  it also  provides  that lfas may  require  reasonable,  competitively
neutral  compensation  for  management  of the public  rights-of-way  when cable
operators  provide  telecommunications  service.  in 1999,  there  were  several
conflicting and  inconclusive  federal court decisions that addressed the issues
of  lawful  "management  of  the   right-of-ways"  and  "competitively   neutral
compensation."  the  telecommunications  act prohibits lfas from requiring cable
operators to provide  telecommunications service or facilities as a condition of
a franchise  grant,  renewal or  transfer,  except that lfas argue they can seek
"institutional  networks" as part of such franchise negotiations.  the favorable
pole  attachment  rates  afforded  cable  operators  under  federal  law  can be
increased  by utility  companies  owning the poles  during a five year  phase-in
period  beginning in 2001,  if the cable  operator  provides  telecommunications
service, as well as cable service,  over its plant. the fcc has clarified that a
cable  operator's  provision of internet  service does not affect the  favorable
pole rates.

         cable entry into  telecommunications will be affected by the regulatory
landscape  now being  fashioned  by the fcc and state  regulators.  one critical
component of the  telecommunications act intended to facilitate the entry of new
telecommunications  providers (including cable operators) is the interconnection
obligation  imposed  on all  telecommunications  carriers.  this  requires,  for
example,  that the incumbent  local  telephone  company must allow new competing
telecommunications  providers  to  connect to the local  telephone  distribution

<page>

system.  in a january 1999 decision,  the united states supreme court upheld the
fcc's fundamental interconnection requirements.

         cable systems providing internet service.  although there is at present
no significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of internet services,
and the fcc recently  issued several reports finding no immediate need to impose
such  regulation,  this  situation  may  change as cable  systems  expand  their
broadband  delivery of internet  services.  in  particular,  proposals have been
advanced at the fcc and congress that would  require cable  operators to provide
access to unaffiliated  internet service providers and online service providers.
additionally,  some local franchising authorities are considering the imposition
of mandatory internet access requirements as part of cable franchise renewals or
transfers.  a federal  district court in portland,  oregon  recently  upheld the
legal ability of local franchising authorities to impose such conditions, but an
appeal was filed with the ninth circuit court of appeals, oral argument has been
held and the parties  are  awaiting a decision.  other  local  authorities  have
imposed or may impose mandatory internet access requirements on cable operators.
finally, several states are considering legislation that would require mandatory
access for unafffiliated  internet service providers.  these developments could,
if they become  widespread,  burden the capacity of cable systems and complicate
and delay plans for providing internet service.

         telephone company entry into cable television.  the  telecommunications
act allows  telephone  companies  to compete  directly  with cable  operators by
repealing the historic telephone  company/cable company  cross-ownership ban and
the fcc's video dialtone regulations. this will allow lecs, including the rbocs,
to compete with cable operators both inside and outside their telephone  service
areas.  because of their resources,  lecs could be formidable  competitors,  and
certain lecs have begun offering cable service.

         under the telecommunications act, a lec or other entity providing video
programming  to  customers  will be regulated as a  traditional  cable  operator
(subject to local franchising and federal  regulatory  requirements),  unless it
elects to provide its  programming  via an "open  video  system"  (ovs).  it was
anticipated  that the primary  benefit of using an ovs  regulatory  model was to
avoid the need to obtain a local franchise prior to providing services. however,
a january 1999 federal court of appeals  decision held that ovs providers can be
required to obtain such a franchise. to be eligible for ovs status, the provider
cannot occupy more than one-third of the system's activated channels when demand
for channels  exceeds  supply.  nor can it  discriminate  among  programmers  or
establish unreasonable rates, terms or conditions for service.

         although lecs and cable operators can now expand their offerings across
traditional service boundaries,  the general  prohibitions remain on lec buyouts
(i.e., any ownership interest exceeding 10 percent) of co-located cable systems,
cable operator buyouts of co-located lec systems, and joint ventures among cable
operators and lecs in the same market. the telecommunications act provides a few
limited exceptions to this buyout prohibition.

         electric utility entry into
telecommunications/cable television.  the
telecommunications  act provides that registered  utility holding  companies and
subsidiaries may provide telecommunications services,  information services, and
other   services  or  products   subject  to  the   jurisdiction   of  the  fcc,
notwithstanding  the public utilities  holding company act.  electric  utilities
must  establish  separate  subsidiaries,  known  as  "exempt  telecommunications
companies" and must apply to the fcc for operating authority.  again, because of
their resources, electric utilities could be formidable competitors.

<page>

         cable  television  ownership  restrictions.  pursuant to the 1992 cable
act, the fcc adopted regulations establishing a 30% limit on the number of homes
nationwide  that a cable  operator may reach  through  cable systems in which it
holds an attributable  interest with an increase to 35% if the additional  cable
systems  are  minority  controlled.  the fcc  stayed  the  effectiveness  of its
ownership  limits  pending  the appeal of a september  16, 1993  decision by the
united states  district  court for the district of columbia  which,  among other
things, found unconstitutional the provision of the 1992 cable act requiring the
fcc to establish such ownership  limits.  if the ownership limits are determined
on appeal to be  constitutional,  they may affect  at&amp;t;  broadband's  ability to
acquire attributable interests in additional cable systems including the pending
mediaone merger.

         the fcc recently  completed  its  reconsideration  of both the national
subscriber  cap formula and the manner in which cable  ownership is  attributed.
although the new fcc formula  increased the number of subscribers at&amp;t; broadband
may "own",  it is not yet clear  under the new  attribution  rules  whether  the
pending mediaone merger will be considered compliant with the new ownership cap.

         the fcc previously adopted  regulations  limiting carriage by the cable
operator  of  national  programming  services  in which that  operator  holds an
attributable  interest  to 40% of the  activated  channels  on each of the cable
operator's systems.  the rules provide for the use of two additional channels or
a 45% limit,  whichever is greater,  provided that the additional channels carry
minority  controlled  programming  services.  the regulations  also  grandfather
existing carriage  arrangements which exceed the channel limits, but require new
channel  capacity to be devoted to unaffiliated  programming  services until the
system achieves compliance with the regulations.  these channel occupancy limits
apply only up to 75 activated channels on the cable system, and the rules do not
apply to local or regional programming services.

         the   telecommunications   act  eliminates  statutory  restrictions  on
broadcast/cable     cross-ownership     (including    broadcast    network/cable
restrictions),  but leaves in place existing fcc regulations  prohibiting  local
cross-ownership   between   television   stations   and   cable   systems.   the
telecommunications   act  leaves  in  place  existing   restrictions   on  cable
cross-ownership   with   satellite   master  antenna   television   (smatv)  and
multi-channel  multi-point  distribution  systems (mmds)  facilities,  but lifts
those restrictions where the cable operator is subject to effective competition.
in january  1995,  however,  the fcc  adopted  regulations  which  permit  cable
operators to own and operate smatv systems within their franchise area, provided
that such operation is consistent with local cable franchise requirements.

         must   carry/retransmission   consent.  the  1992  cable  act  contains
broadcast signal carriage  requirements  that allow local commercial  television
broadcast  stations to elect once every three  years  between  requiring a cable
system to carry the station  ("must  carry") or  negotiating  for  payments  for
granting permission to the cable operator to carry the station  ("retransmission
consent").  less popular  stations  typically elect must carry, and more popular
stations typically elect retransmission  consent. must carry requests can dilute
the appeal of a cable system's programming offerings, and retransmission consent
demands  may  require   substantial   payments  or  other  concessions  (e.g.  a
requirement that the cable system also carry the local broadcaster's  affiliated
cable programming  service).  either option has a potentially  adverse effect on
at&amp;t; broadband's  business.  the burden  associated with must-carry  obligations
could  dramatically  increase if  television  broadcast  stations  proceed  with
planned  conversions  to digital  transmissions  and if the fcc  determines in a
pending  rulemaking that cable systems must carry all analog and digital signals
transmitted by the television stations.

         access channels.  lfas can include franchise provisions requiring cable
operators to set aside certain channels for peg access programming.  federal law
also  requires a cable system with 36 or more channels to designate a portion of
its activated  channel capacity (either 10% or 15%) for commercial leased access
by unaffiliated  third parties.  the fcc has adopted rules regulating the terms,
conditions  and  maximum  rates  a cable  operator  may  charge  for use of this
designated  channel  capacity,  but use of commercial leased access channels has
been  relatively  limited.  in february of 1997, the fcc released  revised rules
which mandated a modest rate reduction that has made commercial  leased access a
more attractive option for third party  programmers,  particularly for part-time
leased access carriage.

         "anti-buy through"  provisions.  federal law requires each cable system
to permit  customers  to  purchase  premium or  pay-per-view  video  programming
offered by the operator on a  per-channel  or a  per-program  basis  without the
necessity of  subscribing  to any tier of service  (other than the basic service
tier)  unless  the  system's  lack  of  addressable  converter  boxes  or  other
technological  limitations does not permit it to do so. the statutory  exemption
for  cable  systems  that do not have the  technological  capability  to  comply
expires in october 2002, but the fcc may extend that period if deemed necessary.

         access to  programming.  to spur the  development of independent  cable
programmers  and competition to incumbent  cable  operators,  the 1992 cable act
imposed   restrictions  on  the  dealings  between  cable  operators  and  cable
programmers.  of special  significance from a competitive  business posture, the
1992 cable act  precludes  satellite  video  programmers  affiliated  with cable
operators  from favoring  cable  operators  over  competing  multichannel  video
programming  distributors  (such as dbs and mmds  distributors).  this provision
limits the ability of vertically integrated satellite cable programmers to offer
exclusive programming arrangements to at&amp;t; broadband.  both congress and the fcc
have considered proposals that would expand the program access rights of cable's
competitors,   including  the  possibility  of  subjecting  both   terrestrially
delivered video  programming  and video  programmers who are not affiliated with
cable operators to all program access requirements.

         inside wiring;  subscriber  access. in an order issued in 1997, the fcc
established  rules that require an incumbent  cable operator upon  expiration or
termination of an mdu service  contract to sell,  abandon,  or remove "home run"
wiring that was installed by the cable operator in a mdu building.  these inside
wiring rules are expected to assist building owners in their attempts to replace
existing cable operators with new  programming  providers who are willing to pay
the building  owner a higher fee, where such a fee is  permissible.  the fcc has
also proposed  abrogating  all exclusive mdu contracts  held by incumbent  cable
operators,  but allowing such  contracts  when held by new entrants.  in another
proceeding,  the fcc has  preempted  restrictions  on the  deployment of private
antenna  on rental  property  within  the  exclusive  use of a  tenant,  such as
balconies  and  patios.  this fcc ruling may limit the extent to which  multiple
dwelling  unit  owners may  enforce  certain  aspects of mdu  argreements  which
otherwise  prohibit,  for  example,  placement  of digital  broadcast  satellite
receiver antennae in mdu areas under the exclusive occupancy of a renter.  these
developments may make it more difficult for at&amp;t; broadband to provide service in
mdus.

         other fcc regulations.  in addition to the fcc regulations noted above,
there  are  other  fcc  regulations  covering  such  areas as  equal  employment
opportunity,  customer privacy,  programming practices  (including,  among other
things,  syndicated program exclusivity,  network program nonduplication,  local

<page>

sports  blackouts,   indecent   programming,   lottery  programming,   political
programming,  sponsorship identification,  children's programming advertisements
and closed captioning),  registration of cable systems and facilities licensing,
maintenance of various records and public  inspection  files,  frequency  usage,
lockbox  availability,   antenna  structure  notification,   tower  marking  and
lighting,   consumer  protection  and  customer  service  standards,   technical
standards,  consumer  electronics  equipment  compatibility  and emergency alert
systems.

          the fcc  recently  ruled  that  cable  customers  must be  allowed  to
purchase  cable  converters  from third  parties and  established  a  multi-year
phase-in during which security  functions,  which would remain in the operator's
exclusive  control,  would be unbundled from basic  converter  functions,  which
could then be satisfied by third party vendors.

         the fcc has the  authority  to  enforce  its  regulations  through  the
imposition of substantial  fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders and/or
the imposition of other administrative  sanctions, such as the revocation of fcc
licenses  needed to operate certain  transmission  facilities used in connection
with cable operations.

         copyright.  cable television  systems are subject to federal  copyright
licensing  covering  carriage of  television  and radio  broadcast  signals.  in
exchange for filing  certain  reports and  contributing  a  percentage  of their
revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool (such percentage varies depending on
the size of the system and the number of distant  broadcast  television  signals
carried),   cable   operators  can  obtain  blanket   permission  to  retransmit
copyrighted  material  on  broadcast  signals.  the  possible   modification  or
elimination of this compulsory copyright license is subject to continuing review
and could adversely affect at&amp;t; broadband's  ability to obtain desired broadcast
programming.  in  addition,  the cable  industry  pays music  licensing  fees to
broadcast music, inc. and is negotiating a similar arrangement with the american
society  of  composers,   authors  and  publishers.   copyright  clearances  for
nonbroadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.

         state and local  regulation.  cable  television  systems  generally are
operated pursuant to nonexclusive  franchises granted by a municipality or other
state or local government entity. the  telecommunications act clarified that the
need for an entity providing cable services to obtain a local franchise  depends
solely on whether  the entity  crosses  public  rights of way.  federal  law now
prohibits  franchise  authorities  from  granting  exclusive  franchises or from
unreasonably  refusing to award additional franchises covering an existing cable
system's service area.  cable  franchises  generally are granted for fixed terms
and in many cases are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material
provisions.  non-compliance by the cable operator with franchise  provisions may
also result in monetary penalties.

         the  terms  and   conditions  of  franchises   vary   materially   from
jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  each franchise  generally  contains  provisions
governing cable operations,  service rates,  franchise fees, system construction
and  maintenance  obligations,  system  channel  capacity,  design and technical
performance,  customer service standards,  and  indemnification  protections.  a
number of  states  subject  cable  television  systems  to the  jurisdiction  of
centralized  state  governmental  agencies.   although  lfas  have  considerable
discretion  in  establishing   franchise   terms,   there  are  certain  federal
limitations.  for example,  lfas cannot insist on franchise fees exceeding 5% of

<page>

the system's gross revenue, cannot dictate the particular technology used by the
system,  and cannot  specify  video  programming  other than  identifying  broad
categories of programming.

         federal law contains renewal  procedures  designed to protect incumbent
franchisees  against  arbitrary  denials  of  renewal.  even if a  franchise  is
renewed,  the  franchise  authority  may seek to  impose  new and  more  onerous
requirements  such  as  significant  upgrades  in  facilities  and  services  or
increased franchise fees and funding for peg channels as a condition of renewal.
similarly,  if a franchise  authority's  consent is required for the purchase or
sale of a cable system or franchise,  such  authority may attempt to impose more
burdensome or onerous  franchise  requirements  in connection with a request for
consent.  historically,  franchises  have been renewed for cable  operators that
have  provided  satisfactory  services and have complied with the terms of their
franchises.

         proposed  changes in  regulation.  the  regulation of cable  television
systems at the  federal,  state and local  levels is  subject  to the  political
process and has been in constant flux over the past decade.  material changes in
the law and  regulatory  requirements  must be  anticipated  and there can be no
assurance  that at&amp;t;  broadband's  business  will not be affected  adversely  by
future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.

competition

         competition  in  communications  services is based on price and pricing
plans,  the types of  services  offered,  customer  service,  access to customer
premises, and communications quality, reliability and availability,  as well as,
for business  customers,  the ability to provide high quality data communication
services  and  technical   support.   at&amp;t;'s   principal   competitors   include
mciworldcom,  inc., sprint corporation, the rbocs and gte corporation. at&amp;t; also
experiences significant competition in long distance from dial around resellers.

         the ilecs  have very  substantial  capital  and other  resources,  long
standing customer  relationships and extensive  existing  facilities and network
rights-of-way  and are at&amp;t;'s primary  competitors in the local services market.
in addition, it is anticipated that a number of long distance telecommunication,
wireless and cable service  providers  and others will enter the local  services
market in  competition  with  at&amp;t.;  some of these  potential  competitors  have
substantial  financial and other resources.  at&amp;t; will also compete in the local
services  market  with a number of clecs,  a few of which  have  existing  local
networks and significant financial resources.

         competition for subscribers  among wireless service  providers is based
principally  upon the services  and features  offered,  call  quality,  customer
service, system coverage and price. the at&amp;t; wireless group's ability to compete
successfully  will depend,  in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to
various competitive factors affecting the industry,  including new services that
may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic
conditions and pricing strategies. the at&amp;t; wireless group's primary competitors
are vodafone airtouch,  bellsouth,  bell atlantic,  gte, nextel  communications,
inc., sbc, voicestream communications and sprint.

         in addition, the wireless communications industry has been experiencing
significant  consolidation  and  the  at&amp;t;  wireless  group  expects  that  this
consolidation will continue.  the previously announced mergers or joint ventures
of bell  atlantic/gte/vodafone/airtouch,  mciworldcom/sprint  and  sbc/ameritech

<page>

will create large,  well-capitalized  competitors  with  substantial  financial,
technical, marketing and other resources to respond to the at&amp;t; wireless group's
offerings.  assuming  these mergers or ventures were completed  today,  the at&amp;t;
wireless  group  estimates  that its  ranking  would  decline  to second in u.s.
revenue,  third in u.s.  subscriber share and fourth in terms of u.s. population
covered by licenses,  or pops.  as a result,  these  competitors  may be able to
offer nationwide  services and plans more quickly and more economically than the
at&amp;t; wireless  group and to obtain  roaming rates that are more  favorable  than
those obtained by the at&amp;t; wireless group,  and may be better able to respond to
offers of the at&amp;t; wireless group.

         the at&amp;t; wireless group's cellular  operations have always  experienced
direct  competition from the second cellular licensee in each market.  beginning
in 1997, the at&amp;t; wireless group began experiencing  competition from as many as
six license holders in certain  markets.  competition  from new providers in the
at&amp;t;  wireless  group's  markets  will  continue to increase as the  networks of
license holders are built out over the next several years. in addition,  the fcc
is likely to offer  additional  spectrum  for  wireless  mobile  licenses in the
future using existing or new technologies.

         cable  television  competes for  customers in local  markets with other
providers of  entertainment,  news and  information.  the  competitors  in these
markets include broadcast television and radio, newspapers,  magazines and other
printed material,  motion picture theatres, video cassettes and other sources of
information and entertainment  including  directly  competitive cable television
operations  and  internet  service  providers.  the cable acts are  designed  to
increase  competition in the cable  television  industry.  there are alternative
methods of distributing the same or similar video  programming  offered by cable
television systems.  these include dbs (allowing the subscriber to receive video
services  directly  via  satellite  using a relatively  small  dish),  telephone
networks  (whether it is through wireless cable, or through  upgraded  telephone
networks),  utility company networks,  mmds (which deliver programming  services
over  microwave   channels   received  by  customers  with  special   antennas),
competitive,  non-exclusive  franchises,  city provided  cable  services,  smatv
systems (which provide  multichannel  program services directly to hotel, motel,
apartment,   condominium  and  similar  multi-unit   complexes  within  a  cable
television  system's  franchise area,  generally free of any regulation by state
and local governmental  authorities).  in addition to competition for customers,
the cable television  industry  competes with broadcast  television,  radio, the
print media and other sources of information and  entertainment  for advertising
revenue.  additionally,  as at&amp;t; begins to offer new services such as high speed
internet access and telephone  services,  there will be significant  competition
from both the local telephone companies and new providers of such services.

         at&amp;t; currently faces significant competition and expects that the level
of  competition  will  continue to  increase.  as  competitive,  regulatory  and
technological    changes   occur,    including    those    occasioned   by   the
telecommunications act, at&amp;t; anticipates that new and different competitors will
enter and expand their position in the  communications  services markets.  these
may include entrants from other segments of the  communications  and information
services  industry  or  global  competitors   seeking  to  expand  their  market
opportunities.  many such new  competitors  are  likely  to enter  with a strong
market  presence,   well  recognized  names  and  pre-existing  direct  customer
relationships.

         the   telecommunications  act  has  already  impacted  the  competitive
environment.  anticipating changes in the industry, non-rboc lecs, which are not

<page>

required to implement the  telecommunications  act's competitive checklist prior
to offering long distance in their home markets,  have begun  integrating  their
local service offerings with long distance offerings in advance of at&amp;t; offering
combined  local and long distance  service in these areas,  adversely  affecting
at&amp;t;'s revenues and earnings in these service regions.

         in addition,  the  telecommunications  act will permit rbocs to provide
interlata  interexchange  services  after  demonstrating  to the fcc  that  such
provision is in the public interest and satisfying the conditions for developing
local  competition  established  by the  telecommunications  act. the rbocs have
petitioned the fcc for permission to provide interlata interexchange services in
one or more states  within their home  market;  to date the fcc granted only one
petition.  in  december  1999,  bell  atlantic  became  the first rboc to obtain
approval to provide long distance in a state within its home  territory,  in new
york. in january 2000  southwestern bell applied to the fcc for authorization to
provide long distance  service in texas;  by law, the fcc is required to rule on
the application in april 2000.

         to the  extent  that the rbocs  obtain  in-region  interlata  authority
before the  telecommunications  act's checklist of conditions have been fully or
satisfactorily   implemented  and  adequate   facilities-based   local  exchange
competition   exists,   there  is  a  substantial   risk  that  at&amp;t;  and  other
interexchange  service  providers  would be at a  disadvantage  to the  rbocs in
providing both local service and combined service packages. because it is widely
anticipated  that  substantial  numbers of long distance  customers will seek to
purchase local,  interexchange  and other services from a single carrier as part
of a combined or full service package, any competitive  disadvantage,  inability
to  profitably   provide  local  service  at  competitive  rates  or  delays  or
limitations  in  providing  local  service or combined  service  packages  could
adversely  affect  at&amp;t;'s  future  revenue  and  earnings.  in  any  event,  the
simultaneous entrance of numerous new competitors for interexchange and combined
service  packages is likely to  adversely  affect  at&amp;t;'s  future long  distance
revenue and could adversely affect future earnings.

         furthermore, in february 1997, a general agreement on trade in services
(gats) was reached under the world trade  organization.  the gats,  which became
effective  january  1,  1998,  is  designed  to  open  each  country's  domestic
telecommunications  markets to foreign  competitors.  the gats, and future trade
agreements,  may  accelerate  the  entrance  into the  u.s.  market  of  foreign
telecommunications  providers,  certain of whom are  likely to possess  dominant
home market positions in which there is not effective competition.  the gats may
also  permit  at&amp;t;'s  entrance  into  other  markets  as only a small  number of
countries refused to eliminate their foreign ownership restrictions.

         in addition to the matters  referred to above,  various other  factors,
including technological hurdles,  market acceptance,  start-up and ongoing costs
associated  with  the  provision  of  new  services  and  local  conditions  and
obstacles, could adversely affect the timing and success of at&amp;t;'s entrance into
the local exchange  services market and at&amp;t;'s ability to offer combined service
packages that include local service.

employee relations

         at december 31, 1999 at&amp;t; employed approximately 148,000 persons in its
operations,  approximately 96.5% of whom are located domestically.  about 28% of
the domestically  located  employees of at&amp;t; are represented by unions. of those
so  represented,  about 94% are  represented  by the  communications  workers of

item 2.  properties.

         the properties of at&amp;t; corp.  consist  primarily of plant and equipment
used to provide long distance and wireless telecommunications services and cable
television services and administrative office buildings.  at&amp;t;'s owns and leases
properties to support its offices, facilities and equipment.

         telecommunications  plant and  equipment  consists of:  central  office
equipment,  including  switching and  transmission  equipment;  connecting lines
(cables,  wires,  poles,  conduits,  etc.);  wireless  cell sites,  antennas and
wireless switching facilities;  land and buildings; and miscellaneous properties
(work equipment, furniture, plant under construction, etc.). the majority of the
connecting  lines  are on or  under  public  roads,  highways  and  streets  and
international  and  territorial  waters.  the  remainder are on or under private
property. physical cable television properties, which are located throughout the
united  states,  consist of system  components,  motor  vehicles,  miscellaneous
hardware, spare parts and other components. at&amp;t; also operates a number of sales
offices,  customer  care  centers,  and other  facilities,  such as research and
development laboratories.

         at&amp;t; continues to manage the  deployment and  utilization of its assets
in order to meet its global  growth  objectives  while at the same time ensuring
that these assets are generating value for the  shareholder.  at&amp;t; will continue
to manage its asset base consistent with globalization initiatives,  marketplace
forces, productivity growth and technology change.

item 3.  legal proceedings.

         in the normal course of business, at&amp;t; corp. is subject to proceedings,
lawsuits and other  claims,  including  proceedings  under  government  laws and
regulations related to environmental and other matters. such matters are subject
to  many   uncertainties  and  outcomes  are  not  predictable  with  assurance.
consequently, at&amp;t; corp. is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of
monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters at december
31, 1999. while these matters could affect operating  results of any one quarter
when resolved in future  periods,  it is  management's  opinion that after final
disposition,  any monetary  liability or financial  impact to at&amp;t; corp.  beyond
that  provided  for at year-end  would not be material  to at&amp;t;  corp.'s  annual
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

         on july 6,  1997,  mci  telecommunications  corp.  and  ronald  a. katz
technology  licensing,  l.p.  filed  suit in  united  states  district  court in
philadelphia,  pennsylvania against at&amp;t.; the suit alleges that a number of at&amp;t;
services  infringe  patents  owned by katz but  licensed to mci for  enforcement
against at&amp;t.; this matter is currently in discovery. based on review to date, it
is  management's  opinion that the claims do not present any  material  monetary
liability  or financial  impact to at&amp;t; that is not subject to patent  indemnity
agreements with third-party equipment vendors.

         at&amp;t; is also a named party in a number of environmental  actions,  none
of which is material to the consolidated financial statements or business of the
company. in addition,  pursuant to the separation and distribution  agreement by
and among at&amp;t;,  lucent,  and ncr, dated as of february 1, 1996, and amended and
restated  as of march 29,  1996,  lucent has assumed  liability,  subject to the
liability sharing provisions of that agreement, for a number of actions in which
at&amp;t; remains a named  party.  at&amp;t; is working to be released as a party to these
actions,  although  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this
regard.

<page>

         there  are four  environmental  proceedings  which are  required  to be
reported  pursuant  to  instruction  5.c.  of item  103 of  regulation  s-k.  in
september  1997,  the  government of the u.s.  virgin  islands filed suit in the
federal district court of the virgin islands against the company, at&amp;t; submarine
systems international ("ssi international"), a&amp;l; underground, inc., a contractor
for ssi  international at that time, and other entities.  in connection with the
purported  1996 release of non-toxic  bentonite  drilling mud within the coastal
region of st. croix by the  contractor,  the suit seeks penalties for violations
of various federal and virgin island statutes;  damages under several  statutory
and common law theories;  removal of the mud (which has since been  completed to
the  satisfaction  of  the  federal  agency  that  ordered  the  cleanup);   and
restitution  of response costs  allegedly  incurred by the virgin  islands.  ssi
international  was a wholly owned  subsidiary of at&amp;t; at the time of the alleged
violation.  on december 31, 1998 the government of the u.s. virgin islands filed
an administrative  complaint against at&amp;t; of the virgin islands,  inc.,  seeking
$23 million in penalties  (primarily  for the release of drilling mud in 1996 in
conjunction with the construction of the st. croix cable landing  station).  the
foregoing environmental proceeding is not material to the consolidated financial
statements  or  business  of the  company  and  would  not be  reported  but for
instruction 5 c. of item 103 of regulation  s-k,  which  requires  disclosure of
such matters.

         in addition,  three  proceedings  involve  matters for which lucent has
assumed  liability,  as described  above.  on july 31, 1991,  the united  states
environmental  protection  agency  region iii  issued a  complaint  pursuant  to
section 3008a of the resource  conservation and recovery act alleging violations
of  various  waste  management  regulations  at the  company's  richmond  works,
richmond, virginia. the complaint seeks a total of $4.2 million in penalties. in
addition,  on july 31, 1991, the united states  environmental  protection agency
filed a civil complaint in the u.s.  district court for the southern district of
illinois  against the company and nine other parties seeking  enforcement of its
comprehensive environmental response,  compensation and liability act ("cercla")
section  106 cleanup  order,  issued in  november  1990 for the nl granite  city
superfund site,  granite,  illinois,  past costs, civil penalties of $25,000 per
day and treble damages related to certain united states' costs. finally,  during
1994, at&amp;t; nassau metals  corporation  ("nassau"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of
at&amp;t;, and the new york state department of environmental conservation ("nysdec")
were  engaged in  negotiations  over a study and  cleanup  of the  nassau  plant
located  on  richmond  valley  road in staten  island,  new york.  during  these
negotiations,  in june 1994,  nysdec presented nassau with a draft consent order
which  included  not  only  provisions   relating  to  site   investigation  and
remediation  but also a  provision  for  payment of a $3.5  million  penalty for
alleged  violations  of  hazardous  waste  management  regulations.   no  formal
proceeding has been commenced by nysdec.

item 4.  submission of matters to a vote of security-holders.

         no matter was  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders in the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

management's discussion and analysis

introduction
in 1999, we made  significant  strides to transform at&amp;t; and deliver growth.  we
finalized  many of the  strategic  acquisitions  we  announced  in 1998 and made
additional investments to further support our facilities-based  growth strategy.
we continued to maintain the execution-focused culture of the new at&amp;t.;

one of the most  dynamic  areas in 1999 was our  wireless  business.  increasing
demand for wireless  services and the  continued  appeal of our digital one rate
(sm) plans drove wireless  services  revenue to grow  approximately  40% for the
year.  throughout  1999 we continued to expand our  national  footprint.  in the
second quarter, we completed the acquisition of vanguard cellular systems, which
was announced in 1998; in august we closed the acquisition of honolulu cellular;
and in october we announced the acquisition of american cellular corp. through a
newly created joint venture  between at&amp;t; and dobson  communications.  we capped
off the year by  proposing  the  creation of a new class of tracking  stock that
will reflect the economic  performance  of the at&amp;t;  wireless  group.  while the
wireless  group will  remain  part of at&amp;t;,  the  separate  tracking  stock will
provide current  shareowners and future  investors with a security tied directly
to the performance of this business.

as we worked to grow our wireless  businesses in 1999,  we also started  putting
the bricks  and  mortar  around our  broadband  plans - a key  component  of our
overall   growth   strategy.   we   completed   our  $52  billion   merger  with
tele-communications, inc. (tci) in march, and quickly accelerated the upgrade of
the tci cable plant,  which will enable us to develop additional revenue streams
from  any-distance  cable telephony,  high-speed data, and digital video. by the
end of 1999,  tci,  renamed at&amp;t;  broadband,  was offering cable telephony in 16
cities   within   nine  pilot   markets,   digital-video   subscribers   totaled
approximately  1.8 million,  and more than 200,000  customers  had signed up for
high-speed  data  service.  to expand our  national  cable  network  beyond at&amp;t;
broadband's  systems,  we announced in may the $57 billion merger with mediaone.
when the  merger  is  completed  in 2000,  we will  significantly  increase  our
presence  in major  metropolitan  markets  across  the  country  with  owned and
operated cable systems passing more than 26 million homes.

in addition to the accomplishments in our domestic growth  initiatives,  we also
made  significant  progress in our global  strategy.  most notably,  we launched
concert - a leading global  telecommunications  company  created  through at&amp;t;'s
joint venture with british  telecommunications  plc (bt). concert represents the
core of our global strategy and began serving multinational  business customers,
international  carriers and internet service  providers in january 2000. as part
of our  relationship  with  concert  and bt,  we also  made  several  in-country
facility-based  investments  during 1999,  including  at&amp;t; canada corp.,  rogers
cantel in canada,  and japan  telecom.  we also  completed  the  purchase of ibm
global network  services and now provide data networking  services to businesses
around the world as at&amp;t; global network services (agns).

[included in the 1999 annual report are pie charts entitled "revenue
diversification by product." these charts depict revenue by product for 1998 and
1999.]

in addition to delivering on our domestic and global  strategic  objectives  for
1999, we also achieved the aggressive financial targets we set for the year. we

<page>

delivered  revenue growth of 6.2% on a pro forma basis for the  acquisitions  of
at&amp;t; broadband and agns, hitting our targeted range of 5% to 7%. the majority of
the  increase  came from our  growth  businesses,  showing  the  success  of our
investment  strategy  as it  begins  to shift  our  revenue  base away from long
distance voice  revenue.  just one year ago, long distance voice revenue was 75%
of our  total  revenue;  in 1999 it  dropped  to 62%.  while  long  distance  is
increasingly  becoming  a  commodity,  as  evidenced  by the  continued  pricing
pressures in the industry,  its current  profitability  supports  investments in
growth  businesses.  these  growth  businesses  in turn  will  support  the long
distance  business as we include  long  distance  as a component  of a bundle of
competitively priced services.

in order to become truly  competitive,  we must become the low-cost  provider in
the industry,  and  therefore,  we are continuing our efforts to reduce our cost
structure.  a year ago, we committed to reducing our 1999  selling,  general and
administrative  (sg&amp;a;)  expenses  to  23%  of  revenue.  we  beat  that  target,
delivering  an sg&amp;a;  expense-to-revenue  ratio  of  21.7%  for the  year,  which
translates into approximately $830 million of sg&amp;a; expense savings compared with
our  targets.  the  fourth  quarter  came in at just  21.2%.  that's a  dramatic
improvement from 1997, when the sg&amp;a;  expense-to-revenue  ratio for the year was
27.9%.  while we've been  successful in driving  costs out of the  business,  we
still have more to do. we will  continue to attack  costs and have  committed to
cutting $2 billion in costs by the end of 2000 by continuing  to streamline  our
sg&amp;a; expenses and by lowering our network  costs by moving more data,  voice and
wireless traffic onto our expanding network of global facilities.

not surprisingly,  our success in growing revenue and shrinking costs allowed us
to deliver strong cash flow results in 1999, with cash from  operations  growing
to $11.6 billion - up 13.9% from 1998.  in 1999,  we generated  $18.3 billion of
reported ebitda [earnings,  including other income  (expense),  before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization].

as  anticipated,  the positive impact of our revenue growth and cost controls on
earnings  per share was more than offset by the impact of shares  issued and the
franchise, goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization associated with
our investments and acquisitions.  as a result,  earnings per diluted share were
10.3% below 1998.  we  undertook an  aggressive  stock  buyback  program to help
offset some of the dilutive impacts of these acquisitions,  and since the second
half  of  1998  we've  repurchased  nearly  220  million  shares,  at a cost  of
approximately  $10 billion.  in 2000, we plan to  repurchase  another 50 million
shares from cox communications, inc., in exchange for cable properties and cash.

we've come a long way in 1999. as the following pages present in further detail,
we've made solid progress in our strategy to transform at&amp;t;, and we've delivered
on our  commitments  for growth and expense  control.  there is still much to be
done, but we finished 1999 with pride in our  accomplishments  and confidence in
our ability to sustain the momentum and further accelerate our growth in 2000.

overview
at&amp;t; is among the world's  communications  leaders,  providing  voice,  data and
video telecommunications  services to large and small businesses,  consumers and
government  agencies.  we provide  domestic  and  international  long  distance,
regional,  local and wireless  communications  services,  cable  television  and
internet  communication  services.  at&amp;t; also  provides  billing,  directory and
calling-card services to support our communications business.

merger with tci
we completed the merger with tci, renamed at&amp;t; broadband  (broadband),  on march
9, 1999, in an all-stock  transaction  valued at approximately  $52 billion.  we
issued  approximately  664 million  shares,  of which 149 million were  treasury
shares that were repurchased in anticipation of the broadband merger.

the  merger  was  recorded  under  the  purchase   method  of  accounting   and,
accordingly,  the results of broadband  have been  included  with the  financial
results of at&amp;t; since the date of acquisition.  periods prior to the merger were
not restated to include the results of broadband.

in connection with this transaction, we also issued a separate tracking stock to
reflect the  economic  performance  of liberty  media group  (lmg),  broadband's
former programming and technology investment businesses. we issued 1,140 million
shares of liberty  media  group  class a tracking  stock  (including  60 million
shares related to the conversion of convertible notes) and 110 million shares of
liberty  media  group  class b  tracking  stock.  we do not  have a  controlling
financial  interest in liberty  media group for financial  accounting  purposes;
therefore,  our  ownership in lmg is reflected as an  investment  accounted  for
under the  equity  method in the at&amp;t;  consolidated  financial  statements.  the
amounts  attributable to lmg are reflected as separate line items "equity losses
from liberty  media group" and  "investment  in liberty  media group and related
receivables, net" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

broadband's cable and certain other operations, including its ownership interest
in  at  home   corporation   (excite@home)   and   cablevision   systems   corp.
(cablevision),  but excluding lmg, were combined with the existing operations of
at&amp;t; to form the at&amp;t; common stock group (at&amp;t; group), the economic  performance
of which is represented by at&amp;t; common stock. references to at&amp;t; common stock do
not include the lmg tracking stock.

ownership of shares of at&amp;t; common stock or liberty  media class a or b tracking
stock does not represent a direct legal  interest in the assets and  liabilities
of either of the groups, but an ownership of at&amp;t; in total. each of these shares
represents an interest in the economic  performance of the net assets of each of
these groups.  accordingly,  the earnings and losses related to lmg are excluded
from earnings  available to at&amp;t; group,  and earnings and losses related to at&amp;t;
group are excluded from earnings available to lmg.

because we account for lmg as an equity investment, revenue, operating expenses,
other income (expense),  interest expense and provision for taxes for at&amp;t; group
are the same as consolidated at&amp;t.;

the  discussion  and  analysis  that  follows  provides  information  management
believes is relevant to an assessment and  understanding of at&amp;t;'s  consolidated
results of operations for the years ended december 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997, and
financial condition as of december 31, 1999 and 1998.

our results include certain items that affect  comparability  from year to year.
we  quantify  the  impact of these  items in order to explain  our  results on a
comparable  basis.  these items include the 1999  acquisitions  of broadband and
at&amp;t; global  network  services  (agns),  net  restructuring  and other  charges,
significant  gains on sales of businesses  [discussed in other income  (expense)
discussion] and the impact of a change in tax rules. the net  restructuring  and
other charges, gains on sales of businesses,  change in tax rules and the impact
of our investments in excite@home and cablevision are  collectively  referred to
as "restructuring  and other charges,  and certain gains and losses." we discuss
our  results  excluding  the  impact  of  our  investments  in  excite@home  and
cablevision since these businesses have financial information publicly available
and their results can be reviewed independently of at&amp;t;'s results.

<page>

following is a summary of the approximate diluted earnings per share (eps)
impact of the above items for 1999 and 1998:
 ..net restructuring and other charges of $0.37 in 1999 and $0.59 in 1998;
 ..gains on sales of businesses of $0.07 in 1999 and $0.18 in 1998;
 ..a loss of $0.18 reflecting the earnings impact of our investments in
      excite@home and cablevision in 1999; and
 ..a $0.02 benefit in 1999 from changes in tax rules with respect to the
      utilization of acquired net operating losses.

operating  income,  on a reported  basis,  increased 45.0% in 1999 compared with
1998; excluding net restructuring and other charges,  operating income increased
23.6%.  operating income margin  (operating  income as a percent of revenue) was
17.4% in 1999 compared with 14.1% in 1998.  operating  income margin,  excluding
net  restructuring  and other charges,  was 19.8% in 1999 compared with 18.8% in
1998. these  operational  improvements  were due to revenue growth and operating
expense efficiencies.

eps from  continuing  operations  attributable  to at&amp;t; group on a diluted basis
declined  10.3% in 1999 to $1.74,  compared with 1998. the decline was primarily
due to the impact of the broadband and agns  acquisitions,  including the impact
of shares issued and equity losses of  excite@home  and  cablevision.  partially
offsetting these declines was increased income from the remaining operations due
to  revenue  growth  and  operating  expense  efficiencies  as well as lower net
restructuring and other charges.  excluding the restructuring and other charges,
and  certain  gains  and  losses,  eps was $2.20 per  diluted  share in 1999,  a
decrease of 6.4%,  or $0.15,  over the prior year.  the decrease in  operational
earnings  in 1999  was  primarily  due to the  impacts  of the  acquisitions  of
broadband and agns.

excluding the impacts of both broadband and agns,  operational  eps for 1999 was
$3.08,  an increase of 31.1%,  or $0.73,  compared  with 1998.  the increase was
primarily due to higher revenue combined with improving  margins  resulting from
cost efficiencies.

operating  income,  on a reported  basis,  increased  9.5% in 1998 compared with
1997;  excluding net  restructuring,  exit and other charges,  in 1998 and 1997,
operating income increased 42.2%.

results for 1997 include net restructuring and other charges,  and a gain from a
sale of a  business,  which  resulted in an  approximate  $0.01 eps benefit on a
diluted basis. in addition,  1998 included a benefit from the 1998 adoption of a
new accounting standard related to the capitalization of internal-use  software.
eps from continuing  operations was $1.94 per diluted share in 1998, an increase
of 22.0% from 1997.  excluding the impact of the 1998 and 1997 restructuring and
other charges,  and certain gains and losses, eps was $2.30 per diluted share in
1998,  an  increase  of $0.72,  or  45.6%,  compared  with  1997.  cost  control
initiatives  and higher  revenue  were the  primary  drivers of the  operational
increases.

total revenue  increased  17.2%,  or $9,168  million,  in 1999 compared with the
prior year.  revenue for 1999  included  broadband  and agns  revenue from their
respective  dates of  acquisition.  excluding the impact of these  acquisitions,
1999 revenue  increased  5.8% to $56,307  million.  this  increase was fueled by
growth in wireless,  business  data,  business  domestic long distance voice and
outsourcing revenue,  partially offset by the continued decline of consumer long
distance  voice  revenue.  adjusting  1999 and 1998 to  reflect  the  revenue of
broadband  and agns for a full  year in both  periods,  1999 pro  forma  revenue
increased 6.2% to $64,141 million from $60,394 million in 1998.

long  distance  voice  revenue  as  a  percent  of  total  revenue  declined  to
approximately 62% in 1999,  compared with  approximately 75% and 79% in 1998 and
1997,  respectively.  we expect this  percentage to continue to decline as data,
internet, wireless and outsourcing revenue continue to grow and as long distance
prices continue to decrease, resulting in a more diversified portfolio.

total revenue in 1998 increased $1,646 million, or 3.2%, compared with 1997, led
by business data, wireless and outsourcing revenue.  improvements in these areas
were partially offset by a decline in consumer long distance revenue and reduced
revenue due to the sale of at&amp;t; solutions customer care (ascc) in 1998.

revenue by segment is discussed in more detail in the segment results section.

operating expenses
for the year,  operating expenses totaled $51,532 million,  an increase of 12.7%
from $45,736 million in 1998. in 1998,  operating  expenses  increased 2.2% from
$44,741 million in 1997.  operating expenses for 1999 reflect broadband and agns
expenses from their  respective  dates of  acquisition.  in addition,  operating
expenses  in  1999  and  1998  included   $1,506  million  and  $2,514  million,
respectively, of net restructuring and other charges. operating expenses in 1997
included a $160 million charge to exit the two-way messaging business and a $100
million benefit from the reversal of pre-1995 restructuring reserves.  excluding
the impact of the  acquisitions of broadband and agns and net  restucturing  and
other charges, 1999 operating expenses increased $198 million, or 0.5%, and 1998
operating expenses decreased 2.8%.

access and other interconnection     $14,686   $15,328   $16,350

access  and other  interconnection  expenses  are the  charges we pay to connect
calls on the  facilities of local exchange  carriers and other domestic  service
providers, and fees we pay foreign telephone companies (international

<page>

settlements) to connect calls made to foreign countries. these charges represent
payments to these  carriers for shared and  dedicated  facilities  and switching
equipment used to connect our network with their networks.  these costs declined
$642  million,  or 4.2%, in 1999 and $1,022  million,  or 6.3%, in 1998 compared
with the prior year. these declines were primarily driven by mandated reductions
in per-minute access rates in 1999 and 1998 and lower  international  settlement
rates resulting from our negotiations with international carriers. additionally,
we continue to manage these costs through more efficient  network  usage.  these
reductions were partially  offset by volume growth,  increased  per-line charges
(primary   interexchange   carrier   charges)   and   universal   service   fund
contributions.  since most of these charges are passed  through to the customer,
the per-minute  access-rate reductions and the increases in per-line charges and
the universal  service fund have generally  resulted in an offsetting  impact on
revenue.  broadband  and agns do not have any access  and other  interconnection
expenses, therefore the results are the same excluding broadband and agns.

dollars in millions
network and other costs of services    $14,385   $10,495   $10,038

network and other costs of services  expenses include the costs of operating and
maintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts,  fees paid
to other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network  roaming),
the provision for uncollectible receivables, programming and licensing costs for
cable services, costs of wireless handsets sold and other service-related costs.
these costs  increased  $3,890  million,  or 37.1%,  in 1999 compared with 1998,
largely  due  to  the  broadband   and  agns   acquisitions.   excluding   these
acquisitions,  network costs increased $428 million,  or 4.1%, in 1999, a slight
improvement  compared  with the 4.5%  increase  in 1998.  the  growing  wireless
subscriber base primarily drove the increase in both years, largely attributable
to the success of at&amp;t;  digital one rate  service,  which has resulted in higher
off-network  roaming charges,  costs of handsets and provision for uncollectible
receivables.  the  increase  in costs of handsets  reflects  not only the higher
number of handsets sold, but the increased cost per unit as customers migrate or
sign up for digital  service.  costs to support growth in outsourcing  contracts
also  contributed to the increase.  partially  offsetting the 1999 increase were
network cost-control  initiatives,  lower per-call compensation expense due to a
favorable fcc ruling in 1999, lower provision for  uncollectible  receivables in
consumer and business  services and lower gross receipts and property taxes. the
1998  increase  was  partially  offset  by  lower  provision  for  uncollectible
receivables in business services, lower expenses as a result of the sale of ascc
in the first quarter of 1998 and the impact of a 1997 charge to  write-down  the
two-way messaging business.

selling, general and administrative     $13,516    $12,770   $14,371

selling,  general and administrative  (sg&amp;a;) expenses increased $746 million, or
5.8%,  in 1999  compared  with 1998.  this increase was due to the broadband and
agns  acquisitions.  excluding  these  expenses,  sg&amp;a;  expenses  declined  $529
million,  or 4.2%.  reductions  in consumer  long  distance  acquisition-program
spending  resulted in lower marketing and sales  expenses.  in 1999 we continued
our  efforts  to  achieve  a  best-in-class   cost  structure  with  companywide
cost-control  initiatives,  which  yielded an improving  cost  structure.  these
decreases were partially offset by increased costs in wireless services to

<page>

support the growing  subscriber base. sg&amp;a; expenses as a percent of revenue were
21.7% in 1999,  24.0% in 1998 and 27.9% in 1997.  we expect  sg&amp;a;  expenses as a
percent of revenue to continue to decline as we continue to focus on controlling
our expenses and prioritizing our spending.  in addition, we expect to realize a
larger  pension  credit in 2000 resulting from a higher pension trust asset base
and  an  increase  in  the  discount  rate  used  to  measure  the  pension  and
postretirement obligations.

[included  in the 1999 annual  report is a bar graph  entitled  "cost  structure
improvements - sg&amp;a; expenses as a percent of revenue" showing sg&amp;a; expenses as a
percent of revenue for the eight quarters ended december 31, 1999.]

sg&amp;a; expenses declined $1,601 million, or 11.1%, in 1998 compared with 1997. the
decrease was primarily  due to savings from  cost-control  initiatives,  such as
headcount  reductions  and a $221  million  sg&amp;a;  expense  benefit from the 1998
adoption of a new  accounting  pronouncement  related to the  capitalization  of
internal-use  software  (statement of position 98-1).  also  contributing to the
decrease in sg&amp;a; expenses was a decline in marketing and sales costs relating to
lower  customer  acquisition  costs in consumer  services.  these  declines were
partially  offset by increases in wireless  customer  acquisition  and migration
costs and increased  costs  associated  with preparing our computer  systems for
conversion of the calendar to the year 2000 (y2k project).

also included in sg&amp;a; expenses were $550 million,  $513 million and $633 million
of research and development (r&amp;d;) expenses in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
r&amp;d;  expenditures  are mainly for work on advanced  communications  services and
projects aimed at internet protocol (ip) services.  the increase in r&amp;d; expenses
in 1999 was due to costs associated with launching  concert,  the acquisition of
broadband  and  development  spending on business  data  services  and ip. these
increases were largely offset by lower r&amp;d; spending on development  projects for
consumer  products.  the  decline in r&amp;d;  expenses in 1998 was mainly due to the
redeployment of resources in support of the y2k project.

depreciation and other amortization    $6,138     $4,378    $3,728

depreciation and other amortization expenses increased $1,760 million, or 40.2%,
in 1999.  approximately  one-half of the increase was due to the acquisitions of
broadband  and  agns.  excluding  these  acquisitions,  depreciation  and  other
amortization  expenses increased $879 million,  or 20.1%, in 1999.  depreciation
and other  amortization  expenses  increased  $650  million,  or 17.4%,  in 1998
compared  with  1997.  growth  in the  depreciable  asset  base  resulting  from
continued  infrastructure  investment  drove the  increase in both years.  total
capital  expenditures  for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $13.5 billion,  $8.0 billion
and $7.7 billion,  respectively.  approximately  three-quarters  of 1999 capital
expenditures  focused on our growth  businesses  of broadband,  data,  wireless,
local and at&amp;t;  solutions.  more than half of the capital  expenditures  in 1998
were related to the long distance network, including the completion of the sonet
(synchronous  optical network)  buildout.  these  expenditures  expanded network
capacity,  reliability and efficiency.  in addition,  in 1998 we invested in our
local network to expand our  switching  and  transport  capacity and invested to
expand our wireless footprint.

<page>

amortization  of  goodwill,  franchise  costs  and other  purchased  intangibles
increased  $1,050  million  in 1999  compared  with  1998  primarily  due to the
acquisition  of  broadband  and,  to a  lesser  extent,  agns.  franchise  costs
represent the value  attributable to the agreement with local  authorities  that
allow access to homes in broadband's service areas. other purchased  intangibles
arising  from  business  combinations  primarily  included  customer  lists  and
licenses.  in addition to the  amortization of goodwill  reflected here, we also
have amortization of goodwill  associated with our  nonconsolidated  investments
recorded as a component of other income  (expense).  this  amortization  totaled
$495 million, $52 million and $66 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

net restructuring and other charges

during 1999, we recorded $1,506 million of net  restructuring and other charges,
which had an approximate $0.37 impact on earnings per diluted share.

a  $594  million  in-process   research  and  development  charge  was  recorded
reflecting  the  estimated  fair value of research and  development  projects at
broadband,  as of the  date  of the  acquisition,  which  had  not  yet  reached
technological  feasibility or that have no alternative  future use. the projects
identified   related   to   broadband's   efforts   to  offer   voice  over  ip,
product-integration  efforts for advanced set-top devices,  cost-savings efforts
for cable  telephony  implementation  and  in-process  research and  development
related to excite@home.  we estimated the fair value of in-process  research and
development  for each project  using an income  approach,  which was adjusted to
allocate fair value based on the project's percentage of completion.  under this
approach,  the present value of the anticipated  future benefits of the projects
was determined using a discount rate of 17%. for each project, the resulting net
present  value was  multiplied  by a percentage  of  completion  based on effort
expended to date versus projected costs to complete.

the  charge  associated  with  voice  over ip  technology,  which  allows  voice
telephony  traffic to be digitized and transmitted in ip data packets,  was $225
million as of the date of the acquisition.  current voice over ip equipment does
not yet  support  many of the  features  required to connect  customer  premises
equipment to traditional phone networks.  further technical  development is also
needed  to  ensure   voice   quality   that  is   comparable   to   conventional
circuit-switched  telephony  and  to  reduce  the  power  consumption  of the ip
telephony equipment.  we anticipate that we will test ip telephony equipment for
field deployment in late 2000.

the charge associated with broadband's  product-integration efforts for advanced
set-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,
was  $114  million  as of the date of  acquisition.  the  associated  technology
consists of the development  and  integration  work needed to provide a suite of
software  tools to run on the  digital  set-top  box  hardware  platform.  it is
anticipated that field trials will begin in mid 2000 for next-generation digital
services.

the charge associated with broadband's  cost-savings efforts for cable telephony
implementation  was $101  million as of the date of the  acquisition.  telephony
cost  reductions  primarily  consist of cost savings from the  development  of a
"line of power switch," which allows broadband to cost effectively provide power
for customer telephony equipment through the cable plant. this device will allow
us to provide  line-powered  telephony  without  burying  the cable line to each
house.  the device currently  requires further  development in order to reach an
acceptable level of reliability. we expect to test and deploy devices by the end
of 2000.

additionally,   the  in-process  research  and  development  charge  related  to
excite@home  was valued at $154 million.  during the second  quarter of 1999, we
ceased to consolidate  excite@home and began to account for our investment under
the equity method of accounting  due to certain  corporate  governance  changes,
which  resulted  in at&amp;t; no longer  holding a  controlling  financial  interest.
accordingly, we will no longer report on the in-process research and development
projects of excite@home.

although  there are  significant  technological  issues to  overcome in order to
successfully  complete the acquired  in-process  research  and  development,  we
expect successful  completion.  we estimate the costs to complete the identified
projects  will not have a  material  impact on our  results of  operations.  if,
however,  we are  unable to  establish  technological  feasibility  and  produce
commercially viable products/services,  then anticipated incremental future cash
flows attributable to expected profits from such new  products/services  may not
be realized.

a $531 million asset  impairment  charge was primarily  recorded in  association
with the planned disposal of wireless network equipment resulting from a program
to increase capacity and operating  efficiency of our wireless network.  as part
of a multivendor  program,  contracts are being executed with certain vendors to
replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure  equipment in the
western united states and the  metropolitan  new york markets.  the program will
provide wireless services with the newest  technology  available and allow us to
evolve  to  new,  third-generation  digital  technology,  with  high-speed  data
capabilities.

the planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure  equipment required
an evaluation of asset  impairment  in  accordance  with  statement of financial
accounting standards (sfas) no. 121 "accounting for the impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived  assets to be disposed of" to write-down  these assets
to their fair value, which was estimated by discounting the expected future cash
flows of these assets through the date of disposal. since the assets will remain
in service  from the date of the  decision  to  dispose  of these  assets to the
disposal  date,  the remaining net book value of the assets will be  depreciated
over this period.

a $145 million charge for  restructuring  and exit costs was recorded as part of
at&amp;t;'s  initiative  to  reduce  costs  by $2  billion  by the end of  2000.  the
restructuring  and exit plans primarily  focus on the  maximization of synergies
through  headcount  reductions  in business  services  and  network  operations,
including the consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

included  in the  exit  costs  was $142  million  of cash  termination  benefits
associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of
voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  approximately  one-half of the
separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
approximately 1,700 employee separations related to involuntary terminations and
approximately  1,100  related  to  voluntary  terminations.  nearly  80%  of the
affected  employees  have left their  positions as of december 31, 1999, and the
remaining employees will leave the company in early 2000.  termination  benefits
of $40  million  were paid in the fourth  quarter of 1999.  this cash outlay was
primarily  funded  through  cash  from  operations.  the  balance  of  the  cash
termination payments are expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2000.

the restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of approximately
$250 million per year, as well as ebit [earnings, including other

<page>

income  (expense),  before  interest and taxes]  savings of  approximately  $200
million in 2000 and nearly $400 million per year thereafter. we expect increased
spending in growth  businesses  will largely offset these cash and ebit savings.
the ebit savings, primarily attributable to reduced personnel-related  expenses,
will be realized in sg&amp;a; expenses and network and other costs of services.  ebit
savings in 2000 are expected to be partially offset by accelerated  depreciation
expense. however, depreciation expense in subsequent years will be lower related
to the 1999 write-off of wireless services' assets.

in addition,  our continuing efforts to reduce costs by $2 billion by the end of
2000 and the planned merger with mediaone may require  further  charges for exit
and  separation  plans,  which we expect to have  finalized in the first half of
2000.

we also recorded net losses of $307 million  related to the  government-mandated
disposition  of  certain  international  businesses  that  would  have  competed
directly  with  concert,  and $50 million  related to a  contribution  agreement
broadband  entered  into with  phoenixstar,  inc.,  that  requires  broadband to
satisfy  certain  liabilities  owed by  phoenixstar  and its  subsidiaries.  the
remaining  obligation  under this  contribution  agreement  is $26  million.  in
addition,  we recorded  benefits of $121 million  related to the  settlement  of
pension  obligations  for former  employees who accepted  at&amp;t;'s 1998  voluntary
retirement incentive program (vrip) offer.

during 1998, we recorded $2,514 million of net  restructuring and other charges,
which had an approximate $0.59 impact on earnings per diluted share. the bulk of
the charge was  associated  with a plan to reduce  headcount by 15,000 to 18,000
over two years as part of our overall cost-reduction program. in connection with
this plan, the vrip was offered to eligible management employees.  approximately
15,300 management  employees accepted the vrip offer. a restructuring  charge of
$2,724  million was composed of $2,254  million and $169 million for pension and
postretirement  special-termination  benefits,  respectively,  $263  million  of
curtailment  losses  and $38  million  of other  administrative  costs.  we also
recorded charges of $125 million for related facility costs and $150 million for
executive-separation  costs.  these charges were partially offset by benefits of
$940 million as we settled pension  benefit  obligations for 13,700 of the total
vrip  employees.  in addition,  the vrip charges  were  partially  offset by the
reversal  of $256  million of 1995  business  restructuring  reserves  primarily
resulting from the overlap of vrip on certain 1995 projects.

also  included  in the 1998 net  restructuring  and  other  charges  were  asset
impairment  charges totaling $718 million,  of which $633 million was related to
our  decision  not to  pursue  total  service  resale  (tsr) as a local  service
strategy. we also recorded an $85 million asset impairment charge related to the
write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain international  operations in which
the carrying value is no longer supported by future cash flows.  this charge was
made in  connection  with the  review of  certain  operations  that  would  have
competed directly with concert.

additionally,  $85 million of  merger-related  expenses were recorded in 1998 in
connection with the teleport  communications  group inc. (tcg) merger, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  partially  offsetting these charges in
1998 was a $92 million reversal of the 1995 restructuring reserve. this reversal
reflects reserves that were no longer deemed necessary.  the reversal  primarily
included  separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower than
originally   anticipated.   consistent  with  the  three-year   plan,  the  1995
restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 1998.

other income (expense)                     $(501)   $1,247      $443

other  income  (expense)  was an expense of $501 million in 1999  compared  with
income of $1,247 million in 1998. the significant  decrease is due to higher net
losses from investments,  largely due to excite@home and cablevision,  and lower
gains on sales.  gains on sales in 1999 included $153 million from language line
services,  $88 million  from wood-tv and $110 million from the sale of a portion
of our ownership  interest in at&amp;t; canada.  gains on sales in 1998 included $350
million from at&amp;t;  solutions  customer  care,  $317 million from lin  television
corp.  (lin-tv)  and $103  million  from  smartone  telecommunications  holdings
limited  (smartone).  distributions  on trust  preferred  securities in 1999 and
higher  interest  income in 1998 as a result of the proceeds  received  from the
sale of universal card services (ucs) also contributed to the decrease.

other income (expense)  increased $804 million in 1998 due primarily to gains on
sales in 1998 as well as increased  interest  income on our higher cash balance.
these increases were partially offset by lower earnings from equity  investments
and a gain in 1997 on the sale of at&amp;t; skynet satellite services (skynet) of $97
million.

ebit  increased  $1,624  million,  or  18.6%,  in  1999.  ebit was  impacted  by
restructuring  and other charges,  and certain gains and losses,  as well as the
acquisitions of broadband and agns. excluding these items, ebit increased $2,805
million,  or 26.8%,  to $13,283 million in 1999. the improvement in ebit was due
to increased  revenue  combined with an improving cost structure.  ebit for 1998
increased $1,455 million, or 20.0%.  excluding  restructuring and other charges,
and certain gains and losses,  ebit increased  $3,037  million,  or 41.9%.  this
increase in ebit was driven by higher  revenue,  the benefit of our sg&amp;a; expense
cost-cutting initiatives and lower international settlement rates.

interest  expense  increased $1,224 million in 1999 due to a higher average debt
balance  associated  with  our  acquisitions,  including  debt  outstanding  for
broadband at the date of acquisition. interest expense increased $120 million in
1998. after the sale of ucs on april 2, 1998,  interest expense  associated with
debt previously attributed to ucs was reclassified from discontinued  operations
to  continuing  operations  since  we did  not  retire  all of this  debt.  this
reclassification is the primary reason for the increase in 1998.

tax rate for at&amp;t; group was 37.4% in 1999,  37.0% in 1998 and 39.0% in 1997. the
1999 effective tax rate for at&amp;t; group was impacted by the in-process research

and development  charge,  which was not tax deductible,  and a change in the net
operating loss utilization tax rules that resulted in a $75 million reduction in
the valuation  allowance  and the income tax  provision.  in addition,  the 1999
effective   tax  rate   reflects  tax  benefits   associated   with   investment
dispositions, legal entity restructurings and other tax planning strategies. the
effective  tax rate for 1998 was  impacted  by the  pooling of tcg's  historical
results,  which did not include tax benefits on preacquisition  losses,  and the
effects  of  certain   foreign  legal  entity   restructurings   and  investment
dispositions.

the  dispositions of ucs, which was sold on april 2, 1998, and at&amp;t;'s  submarine
systems  business  (ssi),  which  was  sold  on july 1,  1997,  as  discontinued
operations.  accordingly,  the revenue,  costs and  expenses,  and cash flows of
these  businesses  have  been  excluded  from  the  respective  captions  in the
consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows, and
have been reported through their respective dates of disposition as "income from
discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable  income  taxes;  and as "net cash
provided by (used in)  discontinued  operations."  as of december 31, 1998,  all
businesses previously reported as discontinued operations have been disposed of;
therefore,  there was no impact to the  consolidated  balance sheets  presented.
gains   associated  with  these  sales  are  recorded  as  "gains  on  sales  of
discontinued operations," net of applicable taxes.

extraordinary items
in august 1998, at&amp;t; extinguished $1,046 million of tcg's debt. the $217 million
pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt was recorded as an extraordinary
loss. the after-tax impact was $137 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

segment results

in support of the  services we provide,  we segment our results by the  business
units that support our primary lines of business:  business  services,  consumer
services,   wireless  services  and  broadband.  a  fifth  category,  other  and
corporate,  comprises  the results of all other  units of at&amp;t; group,  including
corporate  staff  functions.   we  supplementally  discuss  at&amp;t;  solutions  and
international  operations and ventures, which are both included in the other and
corporate category. although not a segment, we also discuss the results of lmg.

the discussion of segment results includes  revenue;  earnings,  including other
income (expense),  before interest and taxes (ebit);  earnings,  including other
income  (expense),   before  interest,   taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization
(ebitda);  total assets;  and capital  additions.  the  discussion of ebitda for
wireless  services and broadband is modified to exclude other income  (expense).
total  assets  for  each  segment  include  all  assets,   except   intercompany
receivables.  prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate
are  generally  held at the  corporate  level and  therefore are included in the
other and corporate group. shared network assets are allocated to the segments

<page>

and reallocated each january,  based on two years of volumes.  capital additions
for each segment include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,
acquisitions of licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in
franchise costs and additions to internal-use software.

ebit is the primary  measure used by at&amp;t;'s chief  operating  decision makers to
measure  at&amp;t;'s  operating  results  and to measure  segment  profitability  and
performance.  at&amp;t;  calculates  ebit  as  operating  income  plus  other  income
(expense).  in  addition,  management  also uses  ebitda as a measure of segment
profitability  and  performance,  and is defined as ebit plus  depreciation  and
amortization. interest and taxes are not factored into the profitability measure
used by the chief operating decision makers;  therefore,  trends for these items
are discussed on a consolidated basis. management believes ebit is meaningful to
investors  because it provides  analysis  of  operating  results  using the same
measures used by at&amp;t;'s chief operating decision makers and provides a return on
total capitalization  measure. we believe ebitda is meaningful to investors as a
measure of each segment's liquidity  consistent with the measure utilized by our
chief  operating  decision  makers.  in addition,  we believe that both ebit and
ebitda allow investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each segment
in  relation  to at&amp;t.;  our  calculation  of ebit and  ebitda  may or may not be
consistent  with the  calculation of these  measures by other public  companies.
ebit and ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally
accepted  accounting  principles  (gaap)  measures  of income  as a  measure  of
performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities
as a measure  of  liquidity.  in  addition,  ebitda  does not take into  account
changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flow.

reflecting the dynamics of our business,  we  continually  review our management
model and structure.  in 2000, we anticipate changes to our segments as follows:
the  business  services  segment will be expanded to include the results of at&amp;t;
solutions,  and broadband  results will be expanded to include the operations of
mediaone upon the completion of the merger.  the wireless  services segment will
be expanded  to include  fixed  wireless  technology  and certain  international
wireless investments.

business services
our business services segment offers a variety of global communications services
including  long  distance,  local  and  data  and ip  networking  to  small  and
medium-sized  businesses,   large  domestic  and  multinational  businesses  and
government agencies.  business services is also a provider of voice, data and ip
transport to service resellers (wholesale services).

revenue
in 1999,  business services revenue grew $1,491 million, or 6.3%, driven by data
and ip services, domestic long distance voice services and local services. total
calling  volumes  increased  approximately  25% for the  year.  revenue  in 1998
increased $1,280 million, or 5.7%, led by growth in data services.

data services,  which is the  transportation of data rather than voice along our
network,  grew at a  high-teens  rate in 1999 and at a mid-teens  rate for 1998.
growth in each  period  was led by the  continued  strength  of frame  relay and
high-speed  private  line,  both  of  which  are  high-speed   data-transmission
services.  on average in 1999, we added  approximately  230 more net frame ports
per month as compared with 1998. also  contributing  to the revenue  increase in
1999 was significant  growth in ip services,  such as at&amp;t; worldnet services and
virtual private network (vpn) services.

long  distance  voice revenue grew at a low  single-digit  rate in both 1999 and
1998.  the continued  strength of volumes,  as evidenced by a high-teens  growth
rate for 1999 and a near-teens  growth rate for 1998, was largely mitigated by a
declining  average  price per minute.  the average price per minute has declined
due to  competitive  forces  within the industry  that are expected to continue.
also  impacting the average price per minute was a change in product mix,  which
in 1999 was largely attributable to an increase in our wholesale business sales,
which  had a lower  rate  per  minute.  revenue  in 1998 was  also  impacted  by
reductions in access costs that were passed on to customers in the form of lower
rates.

local voice service revenue grew more than 50% in 1999.  during 1999, at&amp;t; added
more than 626,000  access lines,  with the total reaching 1.3 million by the end
of the year.  access lines enable at&amp;t; to provide  local service to customers by
allowing  direct  connection from customer  equipment to the at&amp;t; network.  at&amp;t;
serves more than 36,000 buildings in 89 metropolitan  statistical  areas (msas),
with just over 5,800 of the buildings on-network  (buildings where at&amp;t; owns the
fiber that runs into the building).  at the end of 1998, we served approximately
20,000 buildings in 83 msas, with about 5,200 buildings on-network.

[included in the 1999 annual report is a bar graph entitled  "access lines." the
graph depicts the number of access lines for the eight quarters ended  december,
31 1999.]

business services  internal revenue  increased $657 million,  or 72.5%, in 1999.
the increase is the result of greater sales of business  long distance  services
to other at&amp;t; units, primarily at&amp;t; solutions (including the impact of agns) and
wireless services, which resell such services to their external customers.

ebit/ebitda
ebit rose $1,124 million, or 22.5%, and ebitda grew $1,684 million, or 22.8%, in
1999.  excluding 1999  restructuring  and exit costs,  ebit  increased  24.4% to
$6,226 million and ebitda  increased  24.1% to $9,174  million.  these increases
were driven by revenue growth  combined with margin  improvement  resulting from
ongoing  cost-control  initiatives.  the increase in ebit was offset somewhat by
increased  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  resulting  from  increased
capital expenditures aimed at data, ip and local services.

ebit increased $960 million,  or 23.7%, and ebitda increased $1,493 million,  or
25.3%,  in 1998. the increases were driven by growth in revenue and the benefits
reaped from cost-cutting initiatives. partly offsetting the increase in ebit and
ebitda in 1998 was the gain on the sale of skynet, recorded in 1997. in

<page>

addition,  the ebit improvements were partially offset by increased depreciation
and  amortization  expenses  correlated to the continued  high levels of capital
expenditures.

other items
capital additions  increased $1,193 million and $1,405 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  spending in all periods reflects  business  services'  portion of
at&amp;t;'s  investment  to enhance our long  distance  network  (including  the data
network) and spending on at&amp;t;'s local network.

total assets increased $3,692 million,  or 17.2%, at december 31, 1999, compared
with  december 31, 1998.  the increase  was  primarily  due to net  increases in
property, plant and equipment as a result of capital additions.

consumer services
our consumer  services  segment  provides to residential  customers a variety of
any-distance   communications  services  including  long  distance,  local  toll
(intrastate  calls outside the  immediate  local area) and internet  access.  in
addition,  consumer services provides prepaid  calling-card and operator-handled
calling  services.  local phone service is also provided in certain  areas.  the
costs associated with the development of fixed wireless  technology are included
in the consumer services segment results.

in 1999,  consumer  services revenue  decreased $913 million,  or 4.0%, on a mid
single-digit decline in volumes.  revenue in 1998 fell $805 million, or 3.4%, on
a low single-digit decline in volumes. excluding at&amp;t; worldnet services, revenue
decreased  4.4% for 1999 and was down 3.8% in 1998.  the  declines in both years
reflect the ongoing  competitive  nature of the consumer long distance industry,
which has resulted in pricing pressures and a loss of customers. also negatively
impacting revenue growth was product substitution and market migration away from
direct dial and calling card to rapidly growing wireless services.  the entry of
the regional bell operating  companies  (rbocs) into the long distance market is
expected to increase competitive pressures in 2000.

demonstrating our commitment to providing customers with choice,  simplicity and
competitive  rates,  we  introduced  in august 1999 the at&amp;t; one rate(r) 7 cents
offer,  a simple,  convenient  calling  plan that allows  customers to make long
distance calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 7 cents a minute. the offer
has been extremely well received.  at the end of 1999, we had enrolled more than
5.0 million customers,  with more than 60% of those customers electing to bundle
their  7-cent  long  distance  with  at&amp;t;'s  local toll  service.  approximately
one-third  of the  customers  enrolled  in the  7-cent  plan  were new at&amp;t; long
distance customers.

at&amp;t; worldnet  services  revenue  increased  41.2% to $301 million in 1999,  and
78.9% to $213  million  in 1998.  at&amp;t;  worldnet  services  served  1.5  million
residential  customers as of december 31, 1999,  an increase of 29.5% over 1998.
at december 31, 1998,  at&amp;t;  worldnet  services  served 1.1 million  residential
customers, an increase of 22.3% over 1997.

ebit/ebitda
ebit grew $1,400 million, or 21.3%, and ebitda grew $1,547 million, or 21.2%, in
1999.  adjusted  to  exclude  the  1999  gain on the sale of the  language  line
services business and 1999 restructuring and exit costs, ebit increased 19.1% to
$7,823 million,  and ebitda  increased  19.2% to $8,700 million.  on this basis,
ebit margin improved to 35.6% in 1999 from 28.7% in the prior year. the ebit and
ebitda  growth for the year is  reflective  of ongoing  cost-reduction  efforts,
particularly  in  marketing  spending,  as well as lower  negotiated  settlement
rates.

for 1998, ebit increased  $1,646 million,  or 33.4%, and ebitda increased $1,604
million,  or 28.2%.  these  increases  were  primarily  driven by  reduced  sg&amp;a;
expenses,  largely due to at&amp;t;'s focus on high-value customers, which has led to
lower spending on customer-acquisition and retention programs.

other items
capital additions  increased $333 million,  or 63.3%, in 1999,  primarily due to
increased  spending on internal-use  software to add more  functionality  to our
services,  in support of at&amp;t; worldnet services  subscriber growth and for fixed
wireless equipment.  in 1998, capital additions declined $484 million, or 47.9%.
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the allocation of shared network
assets due to lower consumer volumes as a percent of total volumes.

total assets grew $262  million,  or 4.0%,  during  1999.  the increase in total
assets was  primarily  associated  with the purchase of smartalk  tele-services,
inc., in 1999. also  contributing to the growth were capital  additions,  offset
somewhat by lower accounts receivable, as a result of lower revenue.

wireless services
our  wireless  services  segment  offers  wireless  voice and data  services and
products  to  customers  in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and  1900  megahertz
(personal  communications  services,  or pcs)  markets.  wireless  services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the united  states  and  internationally,  aviation  communications
services and the results of our messaging  business through the october 2, 1998,
date of sale.

revenue
wireless  services revenue grew $2,221 million,  or 41.1%, in 1999 compared with
1998. wireless services' 1999 results include vanguard cellular systems, inc.

<page>

(vanguard),  since  its  acquisition  in may  1999,  and  1998  results  include
wireless'  messaging  business  until its sale on october 2, 1998.  adjusted  to
exclude  both  vanguard  and the  messaging  business,  revenue  grew to  $7,304
million,  up  39.0%  for the  year.  the  strength  in  revenue  was  driven  by
consolidated  subscriber  growth and higher  average  monthly  revenue  per user
(arpu), which demonstrates the continued successful execution of at&amp;t;'s wireless
strategy of  targeting  and  retaining  high-value  subscribers,  expanding  our
national  wireless  footprint,  focusing on digital  service and offering simple
rate plans.

at&amp;t; digital one rate service,  the first national,  one-rate  wireless  service
plan that eliminated  separate roaming and long distance charges,  significantly
contributed to the increases in both  subscribers  and arpu. for 1999,  arpu was
approximately $66, an increase of 14.2% over 1998. consolidated subscribers grew
33.4%  to  approximately  9.6  million  at  december  31,  1999.  this  included
approximately  700,000  subscribers from our acquisition of vanguard and 125,000
subscribers  from our august 1999  acquisition  of honolulu  cellular  telephone
company (honolulu).  total subscribers,  including  partnership markets in which
at&amp;t; does not own a controlling interest, were nearly 12.2 million at the end of
1999.  we continue to rapidly  migrate  customers to digital  service,  which we
believe improves capital  efficiency,  lowers network operating costs and allows
us to offer higher quality  services.  at the end of 1999, 79.2% of consolidated
subscribers were being provided digital service,  compared with 60.7% at the end
of 1998. including partnership markets, digital subscribers represented 77.1% of
customers, compared with 54.9% at the end of 1998.

[included  in the 1999  annual  report is bar graph  entitled  "average  monthly
revenue per user (arpu) and  consolidated  subscribers."  the graph depicts arpu
and consolidated subscribers for each quarter of 1998 and 1999.]

wireless  services  revenue grew $738 million,  or 15.8%,  in 1998.  adjusted to
exclude the messaging business, 1998 revenue increased 17.2% compared with 1997.
the increase  was  primarily  driven by the strong  response to at&amp;t; digital one
rate service,  which was rolled out in may 1998, and a full-year  impact in 1998
of eight new 1900  megahertz  markets  that were  launched in the second half of
1997.

as of  december  31,  1998,  we had 7.2  million  consolidated  subscribers,  an
increase of 20.3% from december 31, 1997. digital subscribers  represented 60.7%
of the consolidated  subscribers,  up from 29.3% at december 31, 1997. including
partnership  markets,  54.9% of the 9.6  million  total  subscribers  were being
provided digital service at december 31, 1998.

ebit/ebitda
during  1999,  ebit  decreased  $656  million.  excluding a $529  million  asset
impairment  charge  recorded  in 1999,  and the gain on the sale of  smartone in
1998,  ebit  decreased  $24 million,  or 31.4%,  for the year.  this decline was
primarily driven by higher network  operations  costs,  principally  off-network
roaming expenses as well as greater customer-acquisition and customer-care costs
associated  with the  rapid  growth  of  subscribers.  higher  depreciation  and
amortization of a larger  wireless asset base,  coupled with lower earnings from
our equity investments,  also contributed to the ebit decline.  these impacts to
ebit were partly offset by revenue growth.

<page>

ebitda,  excluding  other  income  (expense),  decreased  $307  million in 1999.
ebitda,  excluding  other  income  (expense)  and the asset  impairment  charge,
increased $222 million,  or 23.4%. on this basis,  ebitda was favorably impacted
by revenue growth,  partially offset by higher off-network roaming expenses,  as
well as the rise in  customer-acquisition  and customer-care spending related to
subscriber growth.

off-network  roaming  expenses  continue  to  negatively  impact  at&amp;t;  wireless
services' results.  however,  compared with 1998, our average incollect rate per
minute has  declined  18.2%.  the  decline in  incollect  rates is  expected  to
continue in 2000. initiatives have been introduced to address off-network costs,
including  aggressively  capturing  more  minutes  on the at&amp;t;  network  through
capital  expansion  within existing and new markets,  acquisitions and affiliate
launches.  intercarrier roaming rates have declined significantly as a result of
renegotiated  roaming  agreements  and the  deployment  of  intelligent  roaming
database  (irdb)  technology,  which assists in  identifying  favorable  roaming
partners in areas not included in our wireless network.

in 1998, ebit decreased  50.1%,  and ebitda,  excluding other income  (expense),
fell 1.8%.  adjusted  to  exclude  the 1998 gain on the sale of  smartone  and a
charge in 1997 related to the write-down of our two-way messaging business, ebit
fell $447 million,  or 84.8%. the decline in ebit was primarily  attributable to
higher costs associated with a growing subscriber base, higher  depreciation and
amortization  expenses due to our growing asset base and lower earnings from our
equity  investments.  these declines were partially offset by growth in revenue.
ebitda,  excluding other income (expense) and the 1997 two-way messaging charge,
declined $97 million, or 9.3%,  primarily due to greater costs associated with a
growing subscriber base partially offset by revenue growth.

other items
capital  additions  increased  by $277 million in 1999 and $250 million in 1998.
the buildout of the 1900 megahertz markets was substantially  completed in 1997.
since then,  spending has focused on increasing  the capacity and quality of our
national  wireless  network in existing  markets as well as the expansion of our
national footprint.

total assets  increased $3,363 million,  or 17.6%,  from december 31, 1998. this
increase  was  primarily  due to increases in  goodwill,  licensing  costs,  and
property,  plant and equipment  associated with our acquisitions of vanguard and
honolulu.  capital expenditures and increased accounts receivable resulting from
the growth in revenue also contributed to the 1999 increase in total assets.

broadband
our broadband  segment offers a variety of services  through our cable broadband
network,  including  traditional  analog video and new services  such as digital
cable and at&amp;t;@home, our high-speed cable internet access service. also included
in this segment are the operations associated with developing and installing the
infrastructure that supports broadband telephony.

million digital-cable customers.  broadband's high-speed cable internet service,
at&amp;t;@home, ended 1999 with approximately 207,000 customers.

broadband's  telephony pilot market initiatives are progressing on schedule.  as
of the end of 1999, we had introduced  broadband  telephony service to customers
in 16 cities within nine pilot markets and had nearly 8,300 broadband  telephony
customers.  the markets  include the  california bay area  (including  fremont),
chicago,  dallas,  denver,  pittsburgh,  seattle,  salt lake city, st. louis and
portland, oregon.

ebit/ebitda
since the date of acquisition, ebit for 1999 was a deficit of $2,276 million and
ebitda,  excluding  other  income  (expense),  was  $645  million.  included  in
broadband's  results was a $594  million  in-process  research  and  development
charge and a $50 million  charge  relating to a contribution  agreement  entered
into by broadband to satisfy certain  liabilities of  phoenixstar.  in addition,
our  equity  ownership  in  excite@home  and  cablevision   negatively  impacted

revenue
for 1999, revenue increased $1,498 million, or 113.4%.  excluding the results of
agns,  the  majority of which was  acquired in april 1999,  revenue for the year
increased  $285  million,  or 21.5%.  the increase was  primarily  driven by the
continued  strength  of at&amp;t;  solutions'  outsourcing  business,  and  growth in
international  operations and ventures. these increases were partially offset by
the increase in the  elimination  of  intercompany  revenue and the sale of at&amp;t;
solutions  customer care (ascc) in 1998.  the  elimination of revenue and profit
generated by the sale of services  between  segments is primarily  the result of
sales of business  long  distance  services  to other at&amp;t; units.  for the year,
intercompany  revenue  eliminated was $1,585 million,  an increase of 62.5% from
1998. this increase can be attributed to the rise in business services' sales to
at&amp;t; solutions (including the impact of agns) and wireless services.

<page>

revenue  increased  $433 million,  or 48.8%,  in 1998.  this revenue  growth was
primarily due to increases in  international  operations and ventures,  and at&amp;t;
solutions, partially offset by revenue of ascc, which we sold in 1998.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda deficits in 1999 improved $2,032 million,  or 67.2%,  and $2,274
million,  or 89.3%,  respectively.  adjusted  to exclude the impacts of gains on
sales of at&amp;t;  canada and  wood-tv in 1999 and ascc and lin-tv in 1998,  and net
restructuring  and  other  charges  in both 1999 and 1998,  ebit  improved  $217
million,  or 18.6%,  to a deficit of $959  million in 1999.  on the same  basis,
ebitda  improved  $460  million,  or 65.8%,  to a deficit of $240  million.  the
increases can be  attributed to  improvements  in the operating  performance  of
international  operations  and  ventures,  benefits  from  ongoing  cost-control
initiatives and the sales of miscellaneous investments. negatively impacting the
improvements  in ebit and  ebitda was less  interest  income due to a lower cash
balance and distributions on trust preferred securities.

in 1998, the ebit and ebitda deficits  increased 47.1% and 60.8%,  respectively,
over 1997. adjusted to exclude restructuring and other charges recorded in 1998,
gains on the 1998 sales of ascc and lin-tv  and the 1997  restructuring  reserve
reversal,  ebit improved $980 million, or 45.4%, to a deficit of $1,176 million,
and ebitda  improved  $987  million,  or 58.4%,  to a deficit of $700 million in
1998.  this was primarily due to lower corporate  overhead  related to headcount
reductions and lower employee benefit costs,  higher interest income  associated
with a larger cash balance,  and  improvements  in the operating  performance of
at&amp;t; solutions and international operations and ventures.

other items
capital additions increased $1,019 million in 1999 and decreased $276 million in
1998.  additional  spending in 1999  reflected  increased  international  equity
investments  that support our global  strategy.  the decrease in 1998  reflected
fewer international equity investments compared with 1997.

total assets increased $7,543 million at december 31, 1999, primarily due to the
acquisition of agns.

48.3%,  to $1,629  million.  for 1998  revenue  grew  33.2% to  $1,098  million.
throughout both 1999 and 1998,  revenue strength was associated with the signing
of new  contracts  as well as the  expansion  of  services  provided to existing
clients.

at&amp;t; solutions,  with more than 30,000 clients,  including ibm, citigroup,  bank
one,  mcgraw-hill,  united  health group,  textron,  jp morgan,  merrill  lynch,
mastercard international and the state of texas general services commission, has
the potential for more than $11 billion in outsourcing  revenue over the life of
signed  contracts.  during the fourth  quarter of 1999,  at&amp;t;  solutions  signed
multimillion dollar contracts with general motors and delphi automotive systems.
also, in january 2000,  at&amp;t; solutions  signed a contract with acer, the world's
third-largest  manufacturer of personal  computers,  its first global  agreement
with a non-u.s.-based multinational corporation.

ebit/ebitda
for 1999, ebit declined $43 million and ebitda  improved $175 million.  adjusted
to exclude the impact of agns, ebit improved $61 million,  or 192.0%, and ebitda
improved $85 million, or 27.4%. for 1998, ebit improved $182 million, or 120.7%,
and ebitda improved $172 million,  or 127.7%.  for both periods,  revenue growth
combined with margin improvement resulting from ongoing cost-control initiatives
drove the ebit and ebitda improvements.

other items
capital additions  increased $104 million in 1999 and declined slightly in 1998.
increased  spending  in  1999  related  to  agns'  purchases  of  client-support

and frame relay services volume increases drove revenue growth in both years. in
addition, nearly one-half of the revenue growth in 1998 can be attributed to the
1998  purchase of acc corp.  during  1998,  we  streamlined  our  operations  by
divesting certain nonstrategic businesses. such streamlining, which continued in
1999,  along with the exit from  additional  businesses that would have competed
directly with concert, negatively impacted our revenue growth in 1999.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda improved $17 million and $12 million, respectively, during 1999.
excluding  restructuring and other charges, and certain gains and losses in 1999
and 1998,  ebit improved $131 million,  or 52.9%,  to a deficit of $117 million,
and ebitda improved $126 million, or 70.5%, to a deficit of $53 million, for the
year.  such  improvements  can be attributed to the continued  restructuring  of
international operations, which included the disposition of certain nonstrategic
investments.  also  contributing  to the  growth  was  the  improving  financial
performance in other ventures and alliances,  international carrier services and
frame relay services.  negatively  impacting ebit and ebitda were costs incurred
during 1999 related to the launch of concert.

ebit improved $66 million and ebitda  improved $74 million in 1998 compared with
1997.  excluding an asset impairment charge recorded in 1998, ebit improved $151
million,  or 38.0%,  to a deficit  of $248  million,  and ebitda  improved  $159
million,  or 47.1%,  to a deficit of $179 million,  compared with 1997. the ebit
and ebitda  improvements  were  primarily  due to revenue  increases  and at&amp;t;'s
efforts to streamline its  international  operations and exit  nonstrategic  and
unprofitable businesses.

other items
capital  additions in 1999 increased $940 million over 1998, to $1,095  million,
driven by increased  investments in nonconsolidated  subsidiaries,  such as at&amp;t;
canada and japan  telecom.  capital  additions  decreased  $341  million in 1998
compared with 1997. the decrease was primarily due to the high level of spending
in 1997, which was directed toward the funding of start-up ventures.

total  assets were $2,777  million at december 31,  1999,  compared  with $1,915
million at december 31, 1998.  the increase was primarily due to  investments in
nonconsolidated  subsidiaries,  partially  offset by the  divestment  of certain
nonstrategic businesses.

liberty media group
liberty  media group (lmg)  produces,  acquires and  distributes  entertainment,
educational and informational programming services through all available formats
and  media.  lmg is  also  engaged  in  electronic  retailing  services,  direct
marketing  services,   advertising  sales  relating  to  programming   services,
infomercials  and  transaction  processing.  losses from lmg were $2,022 million
from the date of acquisition through december 31, 1999.

<page>

in 1999,  net cash provided by operating  activities  of  continuing  operations
increased  $1,418 million.  the increase was primarily  driven by an increase in
net income  excluding  the  noncash  impact of  depreciation  and  amortization,
restructuring  and other  charges,  and the  impact of  losses  from our  equity
investments.  partially  offsetting  this  source was an  increase  in  accounts
receivable,  driven by higher revenue,  and an increase in our 1999 tax payments
primarily  related to the 1998 gain on the sale of ucs. the increase in net cash
provided by operating  activities  in 1998 was  primarily  due to an increase in
operational net income from continuing operations.

at&amp;t;'s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of $27,043 million for
1999,  compared  with a net source of cash of $3,582  million  for 1998.  during
1999,  at&amp;t; used $14.3  billion for capital  expenditures  and other  additions,
contributed  $5.5  billion of cash to lmg,  purchased  agns for $4.9 billion and
loaned $1.5 billion to mediaone to pay termination  fees to comcast  corporation
(comcast).  during 1998,  we received $5.7 billion as settlement of a receivable
in conjunction with the sale of ucs as well as $3.5 billion in proceeds from the
sale.  also in 1998,  we received a total of $1.6  billion in proceeds  from the
sales of  lin-tv,  ascc and  smartone.  our  capital  spending  of $7.8  billion
partially  offset  these 1998 sources of cash.  during 1997,  the primary use of
cash was in connection with capital spending of $7.6 billion.

during 1999,  net cash  provided by  financing  activities  was $13,272  million
compared  with cash used in financing  activities  of $11,049  million for 1998.
during 1999, at&amp;t; received $8.4 billion in cash from 1999 bond issuances,  $10.2
billion from the issuance of  commercial  paper and  short-term  debt,  and $5.0
billion from the issuance of  convertible  securities  and warrants to microsoft
corporation  (microsoft).  significant  uses of cash were $3.9  billion  for the
repurchase of at&amp;t; common stock, $2.8 billion to retire long-term debt, and $2.7
billion  to pay  dividends  on common  stock.  in 1998,  cash used in  financing
activities  was largely  attributable  to the pay down of  commercial  paper and
debt, and the repurchase of  approximately  $3 billion of at&amp;t; common stock. the
at&amp;t; common stock  repurchased in 1998 and 1999 was reissued in connection  with
the  broadband  acquisition.  cash  used in  financing  activities  in 1997  was
primarily for the payment of dividends on common stock.

at&amp;t; has $4.6  billion  of  registered  notes and  warrants  to  purchase  notes
available  for  public  sale  under a  registration  statement  filed  with  the
securities and exchange commission.  at&amp;t; may sell notes under this registration
statement based on market conditions. the board of directors recently authorized
us to increase our long-term borrowing capacity by $10 billion. this would bring
total notes available for public or private sale to $14.6 billion. proceeds from
the potential sale of private or publicly-placed notes and warrants will be used
for funding  investments  in  subsidiary  companies,  acquisitions  of licenses,
assets or  businesses  and general  corporate  purposes.  in  addition,  we will
receive funds from the initial public offering of at&amp;t; wireless  tracking stock,
which is expected to take place in the first half of 2000.

in 2000, we expect cash  generated  from  operations to be the primary source of
funding  for our  dividend  requirements  and  capital  expenditures.  since the
majority of debt maturing  within one year is commercial  paper and debt with an
original  maturity of one year or less,  we expect to fund  repayments  of these
with other short-term borrowings.

at december 31, 1999,  we had a 364-day,  $7 billion  revolving-credit  facility
with a consortium of 42 lenders. we also had additional 364-day, revolving-

<page>

credit  facilities of $3 billion.  these lines were for commercial paper back-up
and were  unused  at  december  31,  1999.  in  addition,  we had a $20  billion
commitment  from multiple  lenders with credit  agreements to be finalized  upon
consummation  of the  proposed  merger  with  mediaone.  in  february  2000,  we
negotiated the syndication of a new 364-day, $10 billion facility.  as a result,
the $3 billion credit  facilities and the  commitments  associated  with the $20
billion  syndication   terminated.   also  in  february  2000,  the  $7  billion
revolving-credit facility expired.

[included  in the 1999 annual  report is a chart  entitled  "ebitda."  the chart
depicts ebitda on an as reported basis and an operational  basis, which excludes
restructuring  and other charges,  and certain gains and losses,  over the eight
quarters ended december 31, 1999.]

ebitda  [earnings,  including other income  (expense),  before interest,  taxes,
depreciation and amortization] is a measure of our ability to generate cash flow
and should be  considered  in addition  to, but not as a substitute  for,  other
measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles.  ebitda increased  $4,877 million,  or 36.4%, to $18,292
million in 1999 compared with 1998.  ebitda increased $2,088 million,  or 18.4%,
to  $13,415  million in 1998  compared  with 1997.  excluding  broadband,  agns,
restructuring and other charges, and certain gains and losses,  ebitda increased
24.5% to $18,873  million in 1999 from $15,159 million in 1998. the increase was
primarily due to increased  revenue and an improving cost  structure.  excluding
restructuring and other charges, and certain gains and losses,  ebitda increased
33.2% in 1998  compared with 1997,  primarily as a result of our  cost-reduction
efforts coupled with higher revenue.

risk management
we are exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign  exchange
rates, as well as changes in equity prices associated with affiliate  companies.
on a limited basis, we use certain derivative financial  instruments,  including
interest  rate swaps,  options,  forwards,  equity  hedges and other  derivative
contracts,  to manage  these  risks.  we do not use  financial  instruments  for
trading  or  speculative  purposes.   all  financial  instruments  are  used  in
accordance with board-approved policies.

we use  interest  rate swaps to manage the impact of  interest  rate  changes on
earnings  and cash  flows  and also to lower our  overall  borrowing  costs.  we
monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value. assuming a
10% downward  shift in interest  rates at december  31, 1999 and 1998,  the fair
value of interest rate swaps and the  underlying  hedged debt would have changed
by $3 million in both periods.  assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest rates
at  december  31,  1999 and 1998,  the fair  value of  unhedged  debt would have
increased by $938 million and $290 million, respectively.

we use  forward  and  option  contracts  to reduce our  exposure  to the risk of
adverse changes in currency  exchange rates. we are subject to foreign  exchange
risk related to reimbursements to foreign telephone  companies for their portion
of the revenue billed by at&amp;t; for calls placed in the united states to a foreign
country.  in addition,  we are also subject to foreign  exchange risk related to
other foreign-currency-denominated transactions. as of december 31, 1999, we had
a net unrealized  loss on forward  contracts of $27 million.  as of december 31,
1998,  we  had a  net  unrealized  gain  on  forward  contracts  of $9  million.
unrealized gains and losses are calculated  based on the difference  between the
contract rate and the rate available to terminate the contracts. we monitor our

<page>

foreign exchange rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value. assuming a 10%
appreciation in the u.s. dollar at december 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair value of
these  contracts  would have  resulted in  additional  unrealized  losses of $29
million and $20 million, respectively.  because these contracts are entered into
for hedging  purposes,  we believe that these losses would be largely  offset by
gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transactions.

we use  equity  hedges  to manage  our  exposure  to  changes  in equity  prices
associated with stock appreciation  rights of affiliated  companies.  assuming a
10% decrease in equity  prices of  affiliated  companies,  the fair value of the
equity hedge would have  decreased by $81 million.  because these  contracts are
entered  into for hedging  purposes,  we believe that the decrease in fair value
would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transaction.

the changes in fair value, as discussed above,  assume the occurrence of certain
adverse  market  conditions.  they  do not  consider  the  potential  effect  of
favorable  changes in market  factors and do not represent  projected  losses in
fair  value  that we expect to incur.  future  impacts  would be based on actual
developments  in global  financial  markets.  we do not foresee any  significant
changes in the strategies  used to manage interest rate risk,  foreign  currency
rate risk or equity price risk in the near future.

euro conversion
on january 1, 1999,  certain  members of the european  union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the european  union's
currency (euro).  the transition period is anticipated to extend through july 1,
2002. we have assessed the impact of the conversion on  information-  technology
systems,   currency   exchange  rate  risk,   derivatives  and  other  financial
instruments,  continuity  of  material  contracts  as  well  as  income  tax and
accounting  issues.  to date,  the  conversion has not had, nor do we expect the
conversion  during  the  transition  period to have,  a  material  effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

financial condition

total assets                              $169,406     $59,550
total liabilities                           81,762      33,919
total shareowners' equity                   78,927      25,522

total  assets  increased  $109,856  million,  or 184.5%,  at december  31, 1999,
primarily  due to the impact of the  broadband  acquisition,  which  resulted in
franchise costs; increased other investments including cablevision,  excite@home
and  lenfest  communications,  inc.;  and the  addition of  property,  plant and
equipment.   property,  plant  and  equipment  also  increased  due  to  capital
expenditures made during the year. in addition,  assets increased due to liberty
media  group,  which  is  recorded  as  an  equity  investment,   and  the  agns
acquisition,   which  resulted  in  increased  goodwill.  these  increases  were
partially  offset by a net decrease in cash,  which was used to  partially  fund
capital expenditures, the common stock repurchases and the purchase of agns.

[included in the 1999 annual report is a bar graph entitled "capital investments
support growth  opportunities."  the graph depicts our capital  investments  for
1998 and 1999 for data/ip, wireless, broadband, local and long distance.]

<page>

total liabilities at december 31, 1999,  increased  $47,843 million,  or 141.0%,
primarily due to the impact of the broadband acquisition,  particularly debt and
deferred income taxes. in addition, we issued $8.5 billion of long-term debt and
$10.2 billion of short-term debt to fund acquisitions,  capital expenditures and
the common stock  repurchases.  these  increases  were  partially  offset by the
retirement of $2.8 billion of long-term debt.

at the  time  of the  acquisition,  tci  had  mandatorily  redeemable  preferred
securities  that were issued  through a  subsidiary  trust and  preferred  stock
outstanding.  in june 1999,  microsoft  corporation  purchased  $5.0  billion of
quarterly convertible income preferred  securities,  which at&amp;t; issued through a
subsidiary  trust.  these  securities  are  reflected  between  liabilities  and
shareowners' equity in the balance sheet. the preferred stock is recorded within
minority interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries.

total  shareowners'  equity was $78,927  million at  december  31,  1999.  total
shareowners'  equity includes the equity  attributable to both at&amp;t; common stock
and liberty media tracking  stock.  the at&amp;t; common stock equity at december 31,
1999, was $40,406 million, an increase of 58.3% from $25,522 million at december
31, 1998.  this increase was primarily due to the issuance of shares  related to
broadband, partially offset by shares repurchased. liberty media group equity at
december 31, 1999, was $38,521 million.

the ratio of total debt to total at&amp;t; group  capital  (debt divided by debt plus
equity of at&amp;t; group) at december 31,  1999,  was 44.3%  compared  with 20.9% at
december 31, 1998. for purposes of this calculation,  debt included $1.6 billion
of redeemable preferred securities issued through a subsidiary trust of tci, and
equity included $5.0 billion of convertible  preferred securities issued through
a  subsidiary  trust of at&amp;t.;  the  increase  was  primarily  due to higher debt
partially offset by a higher equity base.

new accounting pronouncements
in june 1998, the financial  accounting  standards board (fasb) issued statement
of financial  accounting  standard  (sfas) no. 133,  "accounting  for derivative
instruments and hedging  activities."  among other provisions,  it requires that
entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
qualifies for hedge accounting. the effective date for this standard was delayed
via the issuance of sfas no. 137. the effective date for sfas no. 133 is now for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  june  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.  for at&amp;t;, this means that
the standard  must be adopted no later than january 1, 2001.  based on the types
of derivatives we currently have, we do not expect the adoption of this standard
will have a material impact on at&amp;t;'s results of operations,  financial position
or cash flows.

in  december  1999,  the sec issued  staff  accounting  bulletin  (sab) no. 101,
"revenue  recognition in financial  statements,"  which must be adopted by march
31, 2000.  we are  currently  assessing  the impact of sab 101 on our results of
operations.

year 2000
at&amp;t;'s  year 2000  (y2k)  program  addressed  the use of  two-digit,  instead of
four-digit,  year fields in computer  systems.  if  computer  systems  could not
distinguish between the year 1900 and the year 2000, system failures or other

<page>

computer  errors  could have  resulted.  the  potential  for failures and errors
spanned all aspects of our business,  including computer systems, voice and data
networks,  and  building   infrastructures.   we  also  needed  to  address  our
interdependencies  with our suppliers,  connecting carriers and major customers,
all of whom  faced the same  concern.  all  computer  systems  were  tested  and
repaired  as of  december  31,  1999,  and no major  y2k-related  problems  were
reported  as the  calendars  rolled to january  1, 2000.  the cost of at&amp;t;'s y2k
program was $725 million since inception in 1997. total costs for 1999 were $275
million,  of which  approximately $45 million  represented  capital spending for
upgrading and replacing  noncompliant  computer  systems.  less than half of the
1999  costs  represent  internal  information  technology  resources  that  were
redeployed  from other  projects and are expected to return to these projects in
2000.

subsequent events

on january 5,  2000,  at&amp;t; and  british  telecommunications  plc (bt)  announced
financial  closure of concert.  concert began  operations in 2000 as the leading
global  telecommunications  company serving  multinational  business  customers,
international carriers and internet service providers worldwide.

on january 18,  2000,  we sold our  ownership  in lenfest  communications,  inc.
(lenfest),  to a subsidiary of comcast. in connection with the sale, we received
48,555,280 shares of comcast class special a common stock,  which had a value of
$2,510 million at the date of disposition.

on  february 3, 2000,  a  registration  statement  was filed with the sec for an
initial public offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock.  the new tracking
stock will provide current shareowners and future investors with a security tied
directly to the economic performance of at&amp;t;'s wireless business.  at&amp;t; wireless
group  will  include  voice  and  data  mobility,  fixed  wireless  and  certain
international wireless investments.  at a special shareowner meeting in march, a
proposal  to create the  tracking  stock was  approved.  we intend to conduct an
initial  public  offering of at&amp;t; wireless  group  tracking  stock in the second
quarter. a distribution, which may be in the form of a dividend, exchange offer,
or a combination of these, of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock is intended
to be made to shareowners of at&amp;t; common stock sometime  thereafter.  holders of
liberty media group tracking stock will not be entitled to this distribution.

in february  2000,  at&amp;t; entered into an agreement  with telecorp pcs,  inc., to
swap certain  licenses that we currently own in the midwestern  united states as
well as cash of  approximately  $100 million in exchange for licenses in several
new england markets.  the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter
of 2000.
