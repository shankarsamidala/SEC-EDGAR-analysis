                management's discussion and analysis of financial
                       condition and results of operations


results of operations


         on may 20, 1996 the company's  reorganization plan was confirmed by the
united  states   bankruptcy  court  and  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy
reorganization.   the  plan  of  reorganization   resulted  in  a  reduction  of
approximately  $174 million in principal  and accrued  interest on the company's
debt  obligations  and  in  liquidation  amount  and  accrued  dividends  on its
preferred  stock.  as a  result  of the  reorganization,  the  recording  of the
restructuring  transaction and the implementation of fresh start reporting,  the
company's  results of  operations  after may 31,  1996 (the cutoff date used for
financial  reporting  purposes) are not comparable to results  reported in prior
periods.  see note 3 to the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements for
information on consummation of the plan of reorganization  and implementation of
fresh start reporting.


         to facilitate a meaningful  comparison  of the company's  quarterly and
year-to-date  operating  performance  in fiscal years 1997,  1996 and 1995,  the
following  discussion  of  results  of  operations  on a  consolidated  basis is
presented on a traditional comparative basis for all periods.  consequently, the
prior  years'  information  presented  below  does not  comply  with  accounting
requirements  for companies upon emergence from bankruptcy,  which  requirements
call  for  separate  reporting  for  the  newly  reorganized   company  and  the
predecessor company.

results of operations-fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995

         general

         anacomp  reported  a net  loss of  $67.8  million  for the  year  ended
september  30, 1997 as compared to net income of $143  million and a net loss of
$238.3  million for the years ended  september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
included in the fiscal 1997 net loss is non-cash  amortization  of the company's
reorganization  value asset of $75.8  million and an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment  of debt comprised of a 3% call premium and unamortized  discount
on the company's  existing 13% subordinated notes totalling $11.0 million net of
income taxes.

         pursuant to a 1990 oem  agreement  kodak was  obligated  to purchase an
additional  151 xfp 2000  systems by october  1997 or pay a cash  penalty to the
company.  the company and kodak  negotiated  an amendment to the oem  agreement,
whereby the company  accepted a $3.6 million  cash payment from kodak,  which is
included in the current period  results,  a commitment to purchase an additional
28 xfp 2000  systems by the end of  calendar  1997,  and a one-time  purchase of
spare parts. as of september 30, 1997, 12 systems remained to be purchased under
this  agreement.  kodak  purchased all the remaining xfp 2000 systems during the
quarter ended december 31, 1997.

         net  income  for  fiscal  1996  included   $25.7  million  in  non-cash
amortization  of the  company's  reorganization  value  asset,  a gain of  $92.8
million for  reorganization  items and an extraordinary  gain resulting from the
discharge of indebtedness of $52.4 million. included in the fiscal 1995 loss are
special charges of $136.9 million,  representing a write-off of goodwill of $108
million and $28.9 million of costs  associated with software  investments.  also
included in the fiscal 1995 loss is a $29 million  deferred  tax  provision  and
$32.7 million of restructuring charges.

         earnings before interest,  other income,  reorganization items, special
and   restructuring   charges,   taxes,   depreciation   and   amortization  and
extraordinary  items ("ebitda") was $83.7 million,  or 18.1% of revenues for the
year ended  september  30, 1997.  this compares to ebitda of $84.2  million,  or
17.3% of revenues,  and $77.4 million,  or 13.1% of revenues for the years ended
september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  excluding the kodak payment of $3.6
million  described  above,  ebitda was $80.1  million for the current  period or
17.5% of revenues.

         total  revenues  for fiscal  1997 of $462.5  million  represent a $23.6
million  decrease from fiscal 1996, which had experienced a decrease from fiscal
1995 of $105 million.  approximately $9.8 million of the fiscal 1997 decrease is
due to the  discontinuance  and downsizing of selected product lines,  including
ics ($1.5 million),  readers and reader/printers ($5.5 million), source document
film ($.5 million) and micrographics  accessories ($2.3 million).  the remaining
$13.8  million  decrease in revenues is due  primarily to the  expected  general
downward trend in both the  micrographics  supplies and magnetics  product lines
offset by revenue contributions from the company's  acquisitions and new digital
products.  approximately $60.1 million of the fiscal 1996 decrease is due to the
discontinuance  or  downsizing  of  certain  product  lines  including  ics ($20
million),  flexible  diskette media ($20.2  million),  reader and reader printer
products ($12.7 million) and source document film ($7.2 million).

         cost of services  provided as a percentage of services  revenue was 52%
in fiscal 1997, compared to 55% and 58% for fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
the decrease is due primarily to cost reduction efforts in maintenance  services
initiated by new management. cost of equipment and supplies sold as a percentage
of equipment and supplies  sales,  excluding  the one-time $3.6 million  payment
noted above, was 76% for fiscal years 1997 and 1996,  compared to 78% for fiscal
1995.

         selling,  general and  administrative  expenses were 20% of revenues in
fiscal 1997,  excluding the one-time $3.6 million payment noted above,  compared
to 19% in  fiscal  1996.  the  slight  increase  was  primarily  the  result  of
amortization  and transition  costs  associated  with the company's  fiscal 1997
acquisition activity.  selling,  general and administrative expenses were 22% of
revenues in fiscal 1995.

output services

         output  services  revenues  increased  $1.3  million  in  fiscal  1997,
compared  to fiscal  1996  (excluding  the effect of the ics sale).  com service
volumes  increased by 9% while  average  selling  prices  decreased by 12%. data
center  acquisitions  and several large customer gains have  contributed to both
the  increase  in volumes  and the  decrease in average  selling  prices.  gross
margins as a percentage of revenue  decreased by 3 percentage  points due to the
aforementioned  impact of lower average selling prices. output services revenues
were down $8.4  million in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal 1995  (excluding  the
effect of the ics sale),  primarily due to an 11% decrease in volume.  decreases
in average  selling  prices during fiscal 1996 also  adversely  affected  output
services gross margins as a percent of revenue,  which  decreased 1% from fiscal
1995 to fiscal  1996.  alva cd services  grew by $2.5 million in fiscal 1997 and
now comprise approximately 4% of total output services revenue as compared to 1%
in fiscal 1996.


technical services

         technical  services  (primarily  maintenance)  revenues  decreased $5.0
million in fiscal  1997,  compared to fiscal 1996 and $4.0  million  from fiscal
1995 to fiscal 1996, in part due to the effect of replacing older generation com
systems with the xfp, which has a significantly  greater capacity than the older
com  systems.  gross  margins as a percentage  of revenue  improved 7 percentage
points over the prior year in each of fiscal 1997 and 1996 primarily as a result
of the cost reduction efforts mentioned above.



<page>




output systems

         output  systems  revenues,  which is  comprised of both com and digital
output  systems,  increased $3.9 million in fiscal 1997 primarily as a result of
contributions  from the  company's  acquisition  of data/ware  in january  1997.
output systems gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by 12% due to
the  change  in  product  mix with a greater  portion  of sales  represented  by
refurbished sytems which have higher margins.

         com systems  revenues in fiscal 1997 decreased by $5.4 million compared
to fiscal 1996,  which had  experienced  an $18.5  million  decrease from fiscal
1995. included in com systems revenues for fiscal 1995 are $3.5 million in sales
of  equipment  for  use  in  anacomp  data  centers  under  sale  and  leaseback
arrangements.  the  company  sold or leased  135  xfp2000  units in fiscal  1997
compared to 122 and 156 in fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  the decrease in
revenue is  attributable  to an increase in 1997 in the number of units  shipped
under  operating  lease  arrangements,  and a decrease  in the number of systems
shipped under  straight  sales  arrangements  along with a change in the mix and
pricing  of new and  used  systems.  fiscal  1997 and 1996  gross  margins  as a
percentage of revenues  improved several  percentage points due to the change in
product mix.

         digital  systems  revenues  in fiscal 1997 were $9.3  million  with the
second quarter  acquisition of data/ware  contributing $6.4 million in revenues.
there were no digital systems sold during fiscal 1996 or 1995.


micrographics supplies

         micrographics  supplies revenues decreased $18.8 million in fiscal 1997
compared to fiscal 1996 consistent  with the projected  market trends for reader
and  reader/printers,  original com film,  duplicate film and other accessories.
gross margins as a percentage of revenue were comparable between periods.

micrographics supplies revenues decreased $40.2 million from fiscal 1996 to 1995
principally as a result of the  discontinuance  and downsizing of product lines,
as well as the projected market trends noted above. micrographics supplies gross
margins as a percent of revenue  increased 5% in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal
1995 as a  result  of  changes  in  product  mix due  primarily  to the sale and
downsizing of product lines.


magnetic media

         magnetic media revenues  decreased $9.4 million in fiscal 1997 compared
to fiscal 1996. the major product categories  experiencing a decrease in revenue
include 3480 tape cartridges  ($5.9 million),  open reel tape ($7.7 million) and
tk 50/52 tape ($2.0 million).  these decreases were partially  offset by the new
contributions  of $5.8 million from metal particle tape products.  gross margins
as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 1997  increased  slightly from fiscal 1996.
magnetic  media  revenues  decreased  $16.2  million in fiscal 1996  compared to
fiscal 1995. the decrease was due to the closure of the omaha, nebraska factory,
which produced  flexible  diskette  media, as well as reduced unit sales of open
reel tape.  magnetic media gross margins had remained level in fiscal years 1996
and 1995.

decreased  $3.7  million  over the prior year due to the  company's  refinancing
efforts  in  fiscal  1997 and its  improved  debt  structure  as a result of the
reorganization  in fiscal 1996.  interest  expense and fee amortization of $39.6
million for fiscal 1996,  decreased  $31.3 million  compared to fiscal 1995. the
decrease  relates to the  discontinuance  of interest accrued on the predecessor
company's old subordinated  debt during the bankruptcy  proceedings,  as well as
reduced interest expense on the new debt instruments.

         income taxes

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1997 includes $5.4 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $4.2 million of domestic taxes
after  considering the impact of the extrordinary  loss. of the $4.2 million net
domestic tax provision,  approximately  $0.7 million is currently  payable.  see
note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1996 includes $6.1 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $2 million of domestic  income
taxes  primarily  related to the non-cash charge in lieu of taxes of $1.3 milion
along with the alternative  minimum tax and state and local taxes. the effective
rate as a  percentage  of  income  before  reorganization  items,  extraordinary
credit, and cumulative effect of accounting change (8.2%) is lower than the u.s.
statutory rate because of non-taxable  reorganization income partially offset by
increases resulting from non-deductible amortization.

         included in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995 is a deferred
tax provision of $29 million.  the deferred tax  provision  includes u.s. tax on
undistributed foreign earnings of $9 million and a write-off of net deferred tax
assets of $20 million. this write-off results from the uncertainty regarding the
financial  restructuring that was in progress and, accordingly,  the uncertainty
regarding  the  ultimate   benefit  to  be  derived  from   anacomp's  tax  loss
carryforwards.  the  remaining  components  of the provision for income taxes in
fiscal  1995  were  taxes of $4.8  million  on  earnings  of  anacomp's  foreign
subsidiaries and a tax reserve adjustment of $1.2 million.

liquidity and capital resources

         during the period ended  september  30,  1997,  anacomp  completed  the
refinancing of  substantially  all of its significant debt obligations (see note
13 to the consolidated  financial  statements).  the refinancings will result in
significant  interest savings to the company.  anacomp's cash interest cost will
now  be  at  an  annual  rate  of  approximately  $30  million  as  compared  to
approximately  $40 million upon the  company's  exit from  bankruptcy on may 31,
1996. the company's debt amortization has also been  significantly  reduced as a
result of the refinancings.  anacomp made no principal  payments on the new debt
during fiscal 1997 and now has scheduled  principal  payments of $8.7 million in
fiscal 1998 and $13.8  million in fiscal  1999.  as of september  30, 1997,  the
current  portion of long-term debt was $9.6 million as compared to $31.8 million
at september 30, 1996.

         anacomp's working capital at september 30, 1997,  excluding the current
portion  of  long-term  debt was $41.4  million,  compared  to $26.4  million at
september 30, 1996. net cash provided by operating activities increased to $57.8
million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 1997,  compared to $49.8 million
in the comparable prior period. net cash used in investing  activities was $32.8
million in the  current  period,  compared  to net cash  provided  by  investing
activities  of $3.9  million in the  comparable  prior  period.  this change was
primarily the result of the company using $22.4 million of cash for acquisitions
in the current period while the company generated $13.6 million in cash from the
sale of the ics division in the prior period.  also,  the company  increased its
capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment by $4.6 million during
the current period.

     net cash used in  financing  activities  decreased  to $5.1 million for the
fiscal  year  ended  september  30,  1997,  compared  to  $35.5  million  in the
comparable   prior  period.   the  company's   successful   rights  offering  of
approximately  3.6 million shares of common stock provided  approximately  $24.5
million in cash in the current  period and the company's  debt  refinancing  and
principal  reductions used approximately  $30.1 million in net cash. fiscal 1996
financing  activities include a $13 million repayment of debt with proceeds from
the sale of the ics division and $24.9 million in principal reductions on debt.

         the company's cash balance (including  restricted cash) as of september
30, 1997 was $65.5 million, compared to $47.8 million at september 30, 1996. the
company  also has  availability  of $22.6  million on its $25 million  revolving
credit facility at september 30, 1997.

         the company has significant  debt service  obligations.  the ability of
the company to meet its debt service and other  obligations will depend upon its
future performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some
of which are beyond its control. however, the company believes that cash on hand
and cash generated from  operations  will be sufficient to fund its debt service
requirements,  acquisition  strategies and working  capital  requirements in the
foreseeable future.

accounting pronouncements

         in february  1997,  the  financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb)
issued a pronouncement related to the calculation and disclosure of earnings per
share  information.  this  pronouncement  is effective for periods  ending after
december  15,  1997 and,  consequently,  no  adjustments  are  reflected  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  for the period  ended  september  30, 1997.
adoption  of this  pronouncement  would  not have a  significant  impact  on eps
reported for the twelve month period ended september 30, 1997.

         in june 1997,  fasb  issued two  additional  pronouncements  related to
reporting comprehensive income and disclosure of segment information.  these two
pronouncements  are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 1997. the
company has not yet  determined  the  additional  disclosures  specified by this
pronouncement  on the  consolidated  financial  statements  for the period ended
september 30, 1977.

                    report of independent public accountants

to the board of directors and stockholders of anacomp, inc.:

         we  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
anacomp, inc. (an indiana corporation) and subsidiaries as of september 30, 1997
and 1996, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30, 1997,
the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  the eight months ended may 31, 1996
and the twelve months ended  september 30, 1995.  these  consolidated  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management.   our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

         we conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  an audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         as  more  fully  described  in  note  2 to the  consolidated  financial
statements,  effective june 4, 1996, the company emerged from  protection  under
chapter 11 of the u.s.  bankruptcy code pursuant to a reorganization  plan which
was confirmed by the bankruptcy  court on may 20, 1996. in accordance with aicpa
statement of position 90-7, the company adopted "fresh start reporting"  whereby
its assets,  liabilities  and new  capital  structure  were  adjusted to reflect
estimated  fair  values  as of may  31,  1996.  as a  result,  the  consolidated
financial  statements  for the periods  subsequent  to may 31, 1996  reflect the
successor  company's  new  basis of  accounting  and are not  comparable  to the
predecessor company's pre-reorganization consolidated financial statements.

         in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of anacomp,
inc.  and  subsidiaries  as of september  30, 1997 and 1996,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30,
1997,  the four months ended  september 30, 1996, the eight months ended may 31,
1996 and the twelve months ended september 30, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

         as  explained  in  note 1 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
effective  june 30, 1995,  the company  changed its method of accounting for the
measurement of goodwill impairment.

notes to consolidated
 financial statements
anacomp, inc. and subsidiaries


note 1.
summary of significant accounting policies:

consolidation

the  consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of anacomp,  inc.
("anacomp"  or  the  "company")  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  material
intercompany  transactions  have been  eliminated.  certain amounts in the prior
year consolidated  financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

due to the  reorganization  and  implementation  of fresh start  reporting,  the
consolidated  financial  statements for the reorganized company (period starting
may 31,  1996)  are not  comparable  to those of the  predecessor  company.  for
financial  reporting  purposes,   the  effective  date  of  the  emergence  from
bankruptcy is considered to be the close of business on may 31, 1996.

a  black  line  has  been  drawn  on  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements to distinguish  between the  reorganized  company and the predecessor
company.

foreign currency translation

substantially all assets and liabilities of anacomp's  international  operations
are  translated  at  the  year-end  exchange  rates;  income  and  expenses  are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. translation
adjustments  are  accumulated  in a separate  section of  stockholders'  equity.
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income.

segment reporting

anacomp operates in a single business segment providing equipment,  supplies and
services for document management, including storage, processing and retrieval.

significant estimates

the preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
actual results could differ from these estimates.

revenue recognition

revenues  from sales of products and  services or from lease of equipment  under
sales-type  leases are recorded  based on shipment of products or performance of
services.  under sales-type  leases, the present value of all payments due under
the lease  contracts  is recorded as revenue,  cost of sales is charged with the
book value of the equipment plus installation  costs, and future interest income
is deferred and  recognized  over the lease term.  operating  lease revenues are
recognized  during  the  applicable  period of  customer  usage.  revenues  from
maintenance  contracts  are  deferred and  recognized  in earnings on a pro rata
basis over the period of the agreements.



<page>



inventories

inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of  cost or  market,  with  cost  being
determined by methods approximating the first-in, first-out basis.

the cost of the inventories is distributed as follows:

restricted cash

restricted  cash  represents  cash reserved as collateral  for letters of credit
issued  by the  company  or cash  held in escrow  primarily  to  secure  certain
contingent  obligations of the company. the contingent obligations are primarily
related to environmental liabilities and certain insurance policies.

property and equipment

property and equipment are carried at cost.  depreciation  and  amortization  of
property and equipment are generally provided under the straight-line method for
financial  reporting  purposes over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or
the lease terms.  tooling costs are amortized over the total  estimated units of
production, not to exceed three years. in accordance with fresh start reporting,
property and equipment  were  reflected at fair market values as of may 31, 1996
(see note 3).

debt issuance costs

the company  capitalizes all costs related to its issuance of debt and amortizes
those costs  using the  effective  interest  method over the life of the related
debt instruments. unamortized debt issuance costs were $6.6 million at september
30, 1997 and are  included in "other  assets" in the  accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets.  during the twelve months ended  september 30, 1997,  the eight
months ended may 31, 1996 and the twelve months ended  september  30, 1995,  the
company  amortized $.9 million,  $1 million and $5.7 million,  respectively,  of
debt   issuance   costs  which  are  included  in  "interest   expense  and  fee
amortization" in the accompanying  consolidated statements of operations.  also,
in accordance  with aicpa  statement of position 90-7,  "financial  reporting by
entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy  code" (sop 90-7), the company
wrote off deferred  debt  issuance  costs of $11.1  million upon the date of the
bankruptcy  filing.  these costs are included in  "reorganization  items" in the
accompanying  consolidated  statements of operations  for the eight months ended
may 31, 1996.

goodwill

excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired  ("goodwill") is
amortized  on the  straight-line  method  over the  estimated  periods of future
demand for the related  products  acquired.  goodwill at  september  30, 1997 is
being amortized over periods of three to five years.  effective with fresh start
reporting, the company now measures impairment based on future cash flows of the
related products.

for the predecessor company,  effective june 30, 1995, anacomp elected to modify
its method of measuring goodwill impairment to a fair value approach.  if it was
determined that impairment had occurred,  the excess of the unamortized goodwill
over the fair value of the goodwill  applicable to the business unit was charged
to operations.  for purposes of determining  fair value,  the company valued the
goodwill  using a multiple of cash flow from  operations  based on  consultation
with its  investment  advisors.  anacomp  concluded that fair value was a better
measurement of goodwill  considering the company's  highly  leveraged  financial
condition. anacomp revised its projected operating results in fiscal 1995 which,
along with applying anacomp's revised goodwill accounting policy,  resulted in a
write-off  of $108 million of goodwill  for the year ended  september  30, 1995.
this   write-off  is  reflected  in  "special   charges"  in  the   accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

reorganization value in excess of amounts allocated to identifiable assets

as more fully  discussed  in note 3, the  company has  "reorganization  value in
excess of amounts  allocated to  identifiable  assets" of $163.9  million net of
accumulated  amortization of $101.4 million at september 30, 1997. this asset is
being  amortized  over a 3.5 year period  beginning  may 31, 1996.  the carrying
value of the reorganization asset will be periodically reviewed if the facts and
circumstances  suggest  that it may be  impaired.  the company  will measure the
impairment  based upon  future  cash  flows of the  company  over the  remaining
amortization period.


research and development

the  engineering  costs  associated  specifically  with research and development
programs are expensed as  incurred,  and amounted to $4.8 for the twelve  months
ended  september 30, 1997,  $1.3 million for the four months ended september 30,
1996,  $2.4 million for the eight months ended may 31, 1996 and $2.2 million for
the twelve  months  ended  september  30,  1995.  the company  supports  several
engineering   processes,   including  basic  technological   research,   product
development   and   sustaining   engineering   support  for  existing   customer
installations.  the majority of the operating costs for engineering  programs in
fiscal year 1995 related to continued software  development for the xfp 2000 com
recorder, which were recorded as deferred software costs.

deferred  software costs are the  capitalized  costs of software  products to be
sold in future  periods with com systems or as stand alone  products for current
com system users. the unamortized costs are evaluated for impairment each period
by  determining  their net realizable  value.  such costs are amortized over the
greater of the estimated units of sale or under the straight-line  method not to
exceed five years.  due to lower than  expected  sales of new software  products
introduced in 1995,  anacomp  revised its  projected  future sales and operating
results of software  products  through  1999.  as a result,  during 1995 anacomp
wrote off $20.3 million of deferred  software costs and established a reserve of
$8.6 million for future payments to ibm pennant systems for software royalty and
system support  obligations  which were not  recoverable  based on these revised
projections  (see note 17). these charges are reflected in "special  charges" in
the accompanying  consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
september  30,  1995.  unamortized  deferred  software  costs  remaining  as  of
september 30, 1997 total $2.5 million and are included in "other  assets" on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

sale-leaseback transactions

anacomp  entered  into  sale-leaseback  transactions  of $19.3  million  in 1995
relating to com systems installed in the company's data service centers. part of
the  proceeds  were  treated as fixed asset sales and the  remainder as sales of
equipment.  revenues of $3.5 million were recorded for the year ended  september
30,  1995.  all  profits  were  deferred  and  were  being  recognized  over the
applicable  leaseback  periods.  in  connection  with fresh start  reporting  as
discussed  in  note  3,  the  deferred   profit  amount  was  reduced  to  zero.
concurrently,  the company  established an unfavorable  lease reserve related to
these leases which is being amortized over the applicable lease periods.
at september 30, 1997 $4.4 million of this reserve remained to be amortized.

accrued lease reserves

other  noncurrent  liabilities  include  reserves  established  for  unfavorable
facility and equipment lease  commitments,  vacant facilities and related future
lease costs. total obligations  recorded for these unfavorable lease commitments
and future  lease and related  costs at their  estimated  amounts  were $6.2 and
$11.4 million at september 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  the current portion
of these  obligations  was $4.9 and $6.8  million as of  september  30, 1997 and
1996, respectively, and is included in "other accrued liabilities" and "accounts
payable" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

income taxes

anacomp  accounts for income taxes based on the  liability  method for computing
deferred income taxes. the benefit of certain loss  carryforwards  are estimated
and  recorded as an asset  unless it is "more  likely than not" that the benefit
will not be realized.

during 1995,  the valuation  allowance was increased to reduce the company's net
deferred tax asset to zero as a result of the company's  deteriorating financial
condition.

 in general, anacomp's practice has been to reinvest the earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries in those  operations and to repatriate  those earnings only when it
was  advantageous to do so. in 1995,  anacomp  changed its practice  whereby the
company now repatriates these earnings.  as a result,  anacomp recorded deferred
taxes of $8.8 million on all undistributed foreign earnings in 1995.

cash and cash equivalents

anacomp  considers  all highly  liquid  investments  purchased  with an original
maturity  of  three  months  or  less to be cash  equivalents.  these  temporary
investments,  primarily repurchase  agreements and other overnight  investments,
are recorded at cost, which approximates market.

note  2.
financial reorganization:

on may 20, 1996 (the "confirmation  date"), the u.s.  bankruptcy court confirmed
the company's third amended joint plan of reorganization (the "reorganization"),
and on june 4, 1996,  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  pursuant  to the
reorganization, on such date certain indebtedness of the company was canceled in
exchange  for cash,  new  indebtedness,  and /or new equity  interests,  certain
indebtedness was reinstated,  certain other prepetition  claims were discharged,
certain  claims were settled,  executory  contracts  and  unexpired  leases were
assumed or rejected,  and the members of a new board of directors of the company
were   designated.   the  company   simultaneously   distributed   to  creditors
approximately  $22  million  in cash,  $112.2  million  principal  amount of its
11-5/8%  senior  secured  notes due 1999 (the "senior  secured  notes") and $160
million  principal  amount of its 13%  senior  subordinated  notes due 2002 (the
"senior subordinated notes"),  equity securities consisting of 10 million shares
of new common  stock and 362,694  warrants,  each of which is  convertible  into
1.0566  shares of new common  stock  during the five year period  ending june 3,
2001 at an exercise price of $11.57 per share.

the process began january 5, 1996,  when anacomp filed a  prenegotiated  plan of
reorganization  with the u.s.  bankruptcy  court in delaware under chapter 11 of
the u.s.  bankruptcy code. the company was in default under substantially all of
its  debt  agreements  as a result  of its  failure  to make  $89.7  million  of
principal  payments  scheduled  for april 26,  1995 and  october 26, 1995 on the
senior  secured  credit  facilities  (including  $60  million  relating  to  the
revolving  loan agreement  which expired on october 26, 1995),  $11.4 million of
principal and interest  payments on the 9% convertible  subordinated  debentures
which were due january 15, 1996,  $34.1 million of interest  payments  scheduled
for may 1, 1995 and november 1, 1995 on its senior  subordinated notes, and $3.2
million of interest payments scheduled for july 15, 1995 and january 15, 1996 on
the  13.875%  subordinated  debentures,  as well as certain  financial  covenant
violations, and the cross-default provisions of the other debt agreements.

note  3.
fresh start reporting and bankruptcy reorganization:

as noted above,  upon emerging from  bankruptcy,  the company's  revolving loan,
multi-currency  revolving  loan, term loans,  series b senior notes,  15% senior
subordinated  notes,   13.875%  convertible   subordinated   debentures  and  9%
convertible  subordinated  debentures were canceled. in addition,  the company's
8.25% cumulative  convertible  redeemable  exchangeable  preferred stock, common
stock, warrants and stock options were canceled.  in connection  therewith,  the
company issued new debt and equity  securities as mentioned  above and described
in more detail in notes 13 and 15.


as of may 31, 1996, the company adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with
the american  institute of certified public  accountant's  statement of position
90-7  "financial  reporting by entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy
code" ("sop 90-7").  fresh start reporting  resulted in material  changes to the
condensed consolidated balance sheet, including valuation of assets,  intangible
assets  (including  goodwill) and liabilities at fair market value and valuation
of equity based on the appraised  reorganization  value of the ongoing business.
the net result of the  valuation of  identifiable  assets,  the  recognition  of
liabilities at fair market value and the valuation of equity was the reorganized
company  recognizing an asset  "reorganization  value in excess of  identifiable
assets" totaling $267.5 million as of may 31, 1996.











as a result of the bankruptcy  reorganization,  the predecessor company recorded
an  extraordinary  gain  resulting from the discharge of  indebtedness  of $52.4
million calculated as follows:

sale of ics division:

effective  november 1, 1995,  anacomp sold its ics  division  for  approximately
$13.5 million,  which resulted in a net gain to the company of $6.2 million that
is  reflected  in "other  income  (expense)"  in the  accompanying  consolidated
statement of  operations.  the  proceeds  from this sale were used to reduce the
principal  balance on certain  senior debt.  the ics division  performed  source
document  microfilm services at several facilities around the country generating
approximately $20 million of revenues per year.

note 5.
restructuring charges:

included in the operating  results for 1995 are  restructuring  charges of $32.7
million.  these  charges were the result of the  company's  reassessment  of its
strategy for ongoing  financial  improvement  and a decision to downsize or exit
certain  areas of its  business.  specifically,  the  company  closed its omaha,
nebraska  magnetic  media  manufacturing  facility,  exited the  manufacture  of
readers and reader/printers at its san diego, california  manufacturing facility
and reduced headcount  worldwide.  the restructuring  charges included severance
costs of $5.9  million,  which  included  personnel  related to magnetics  media
manufacturing,   reader  and  reader/printer  manufacturing  and  other  various
personnel associated with the worldwide headcount  reduction.  approximately 400
people were terminated  pursuant to these plans.  also included in restructuring
charges were inventory write downs of $9.1 million,  excess facility reserves of
$7.7 million and other  reserves of $10  million.  the company  completed  these
restructuring  activities  during fiscal 1996. the actual costs  associated with
the  restructuring  did not  vary  significantly  from the  previously  reported
amounts.


note 6.
financial restructuring costs:

on april 6, 1995,  anacomp announced that it had withdrawn its proposed offering
of $225 million  senior  secured notes and a related offer to purchase up to $50
million of the  company's  outstanding  15%  senior  subordinated  notes.  costs
directly  related to these  activities  of $6 million are included as "financial
restructuring costs" in the accompanying  consolidated  statements of operations
for fiscal year 1995.

senior secured credit facility

on february 28, 1997, the company and certain foreign  subsidiaries entered into
a credit and guarantee  agreement  (the "credit  facility")  with a syndicate of
banks  and other  financial  institutions  (collectively,  the  "senior  secured
lenders"),  lehman commerical paper inc., as arranger and syndication agent, and
the  first  national  bank  of  chicago  (in  its  individual  capacity,  "first
chicago"),  as  administrative  agent.  the credit  facility  provides for a $55
million term loan facility  ("the term  facility")  and a $25 million  revolving
credit  facility (the "revolving  facility").  the proceeds of the term facility
and available  cash were used to repay the existing 11 5/8% senior secured notes
due 1999 (the "old senior secured notes"). the balance of the old senior secured
notes at february 28, 1997, was $83.6 million,  reflecting the prepayment of the
march 31, 1997 installment of $14.3 million made on february 20, 1997.

as of september 30, 1997, $55 million was  outstanding  under the term facility,
and $2.4  million  was  outstanding  under the  revolving  facility.  the entire
revolving  facility  is  available  for loans  denominated  in u.s.  dollars and
certain foreign currencies ("multicurrency loans"), and up to $10 million of the
revolving  facility is available for letters of credit of which $2.7 million was
outstanding  at september  30, 1997.  the term facility is repayable in thirteen
quarterly installments commencing march 31, 1998, with the final installment due
on march 31, 2001. the revolving facility terminates on february 28, 2001.

the  company may elect to have loans  under the term  facility or the  revolving
facility  bear  interest  at (a)  the  alternate  base  rate  plus 2% or (b) the
eurodollar rate, or in the case of multicurrency  loans, the eurocurrency  rate,
plus 3%. interest is payable quarterly and at the end of the interest period (as
defined in the credit facility). the "alternate base rate" for any day means the
higher of (i) the corporate base rate of interest announced by first chicago and
(ii) the federal funds rate published by the federal reserve bank of new york on
the next business day plus 1/2%. the  "eurodollar  rate" for any interest period
means (a) the  applicable  london  interbank  offered  rate for deposits in u.s.
dollars two business days prior to the first day of the interest  period divided
by (b) one minus the "eurocurrency  liabilities" under regulation d of the board
of governors of the federal  reserve  system.  the  "eurocurrency  rate" for any
interest  period means the rate at which first chicago  offers to place deposits
in the  applicable  foreign  currency  with  first-class  banks  in  the  london
interbank  market  two  business  days  prior to the first  day of the  interest
period.



the term facility and the revolving facility are secured by all of the company's
tangible and intangible assets (including  intellectual property,  real property
and all of the  capital  stock  of  each of the  company's  direct  or  indirect
domestic  subsidiaries  and 65% of the  capital  stock of each of the  company's
material direct foreign  subsidiaries).  all of the company's  obligations under
the credit facility are  unconditionally  guaranteed by the company's  direct or
indirect domestic subsidiaries.  in addition to customary covenants,  the credit
facility requires that the company:  (a) maintain certain ratios of consolidated
ebitda (as defined in the credit facility), (b) not incur any indebtedness other
than the 10 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2004 (the "notes"),  indebtedness
under the credit  facility and certain  other  indebtedness,  (c) not permit any
lien to exist on any of its  property,  assets or revenues,  except the liens in
favor of the senior secured lenders,  existing liens and certain other liens (d)
not to incur any guarantee obligations, except the guarantee obligations related
to the credit facility and certain other guarantee obligations and (e) prohibits
payment of dividends to common shareholders.

the  company  must use 25% of  consolidated  excess cash flow (as defined in the
credit  facility)  in  fiscal  1997 and 50% of  consolidated  excess  cash  flow
thereafter to repay the term facility and reduce revolving facility commitments.
additionally,  100% of the net proceeds  (as defined in the credit  facility) of
any asset sale (as defined in the credit  facility) and 75% of proceeds from the
sale of  capital  stock  (as  defined  in the  credit  facility)  not  used  for
acquisitions  or the repurchase of  subordinated  debt, must be applied to repay
the term  facility  and  reduce the  revolving  facility  commitments.  the term
facility repayment schedule, after considering the terms of the excess cash flow
requirements, is as follows:

10 7/8% senior subordinated notes

on  march  24,  1997,  the  company  issued  $200  million  of  10  7/8%  senior
subordinated  notes ("the  notes").  the notes were sold at 98.2071% of the face
amount to yield proceeds of $196.4 million.  the proceeds of the notes were used
to repay the existing  13% senior  subordinated  notes due 2002,  including a 3%
call  premium  and  accrued  interest,  to reduce  the skc trade  payable by $10
million and associated  accrued interest,  and to pay certain fees and expenses.
as a result of the call premium ($5.2 million) and existing  discount on the 13%
notes  ($11.6  million),  the  company  recorded  an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment of debt of $11.0 million, net of tax benefits.

the notes are not  redeemable  at the  option of the  company  prior to april 1,
2000. on or after such date until april 1, 2003, the notes will be redeemable at
the option of the company in whole or in part at prices ranging from 108.156% to
102.710% plus accrued and unpaid interest.  on or after april 1, 2003, the notes
may be  redeemable at 100% plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  prior to april 1,
2000,  the company may, at its option,  use the net cash proceeds of one or more
public equity  offerings (as defined in the  indenture),  to redeem up to 35% of
the  aggregate  principal  amount at a redemption  price equal to 110.875%  plus
unpaid  interest to the date of redemption,  provided that at least $130 million
of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued remains outstanding
after any such redemption.

also,  upon a change of control  (as defined in the  indenture),  the company is
required to make an offer to purchase the notes then  outstanding  at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the  principal  amount  thereof,  plus accrued and unpaid
interest.  the notes have no sinking  fund  requirements  and are due in full on
april 1, 2004.

the notes  are  general  unsecured  obligations  of the  company  and  expressly
subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior  indebtedness
(as defined in the  indenture)  of the  company.  the notes will rank pari passu
with any future senior  subordinated  indebtedness (as defined in the indenture)
and senior to all subordinated indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) of the
company.

the indenture relating to the notes contains covenants related to limitations of
indebtedness  of  the  company  and  restricted  subsidiaries,   limitations  on
restricted   payments,   limitations  on  restrictions  on  distributions   from
restricted subsidiaries, limitations on sale of assets and restricted subsidiary
stock,  limitations  on  liens,  a  prohibition  on  layering,   limitations  on
transactions with affiliates,  limitations on issuance and sale of capital stock
of restricted  subsidiaries,  limitations  of  sale/leaseback  transactions  and
prohibits payment of dividends to common shareholders.

on  september  18,  1996,  the  company  distributed  0.36 rights to purchase an

reorganized company

preferred stock

the board of  directors of the company has the ability,  at its  discretion,  to
create  one  or  more  series  of  preferred   stock  and  shall  determine  the
preferences,  limitations,  and relative  voting and other rights of one or more
series of preferred stock.

stock option plans

on july 22, 1996, the company's board of directors approved the 1996 restructure
recognition  incentive  plan.  under this plan,  effective  august 22, 1996, the
company  awarded to employees  947,500 stock options to acquire new common stock
and 99,050 shares of restricted new common stock.

with regard to the stock options,  the options were granted at an exercise price
of $4.63 per share of new common stock which will result in  approximately  $3.2
million of compensation  expense over the vesting period of the options based on
the  market  value of the stock at august  22,  1996.  75% of the  options  vest
ratably  during  the  period  from june 30,  1997 to june 30,  1999.  25% of the
options vest on september 30, 1999, provided certain performance goals have been
met;  otherwise  the  options  vest on june 30,  2003.  during  1997  and  1996,
approximately  $1  million  and  $200,000,   respectively,   was  recognized  as
compensation expense related to the options and the above noted restricted stock
award.  the options expire 10 years after the date of the grant. as of september
30, 1997, 164,950 options were exercisable.

with  regard to the  restricted  shares of new common  stock,  the  shares  vest
immediately  and thus the  company  recognized  approximately  $0.8  million  of
compensation  expense  immediately  upon  granting the award based on the market
value of the company's  stock on august 22, 1996. the shares are restricted from
sale or transfer by the  recipient  employees  until after  september  30, 1997.
effective  december 6, 1996,  34,650 shares of restricted stock were returned by
employees to the company.

in addition,  on february 3, 1997 the company's  shareholders  approved the 1996
long-term  incentive  plan,  which  provides for the future  issuance of various
forms of stock related awards including options,  stock appreciation  rights and
restricted shares. the company has reserved 1,400,000 shares of new common stock
for issuance  under this plan.  awards,  including  the nature of the awards and
related  exercise  prices,  are  to be  determined  at  the  discretion  of  the
compensation  committee of the board of directors  in  accordance  with the plan
provisions.

the company  accounts for its stock option plans in accordance  with apb opinion
no. 25 ("apb 25"),  under which  compensation  expense is recognized only to the
extent the exercise  price of the option is less than the fair market value of a
share of stock at the date of  grant.  during  1995,  the  financial  accounting
standards  board issued  statement of financial  accounting  standards  no. 123,
accounting for stock based  compensations  (sfas 123), which considers the stock
options as compensation expense to the company, based on their fair value at the
date of grant. under this new standard, the company has the option of accounting
for employee  stock  option plans as it currently  does or under the new method.
the company intends to continue to use the apb 25 method for accounting, but has
adopted the  disclosure  requirements  of sfas 123. had  compensation  costs for
these plans been  determined  consistant with sfas 123, the company's net income
would have been as follows:

exercised  subject to such  restrictions as the board may impose at the time the
option was granted. in any event, each option terminated not later than 10 years
after the date on which it was granted.

at september 30, 1997, the reorganized company has nols of approximately  $149.6
million available to offset future taxable income.  this amount will increase to
$199.1 million as certain temporary differences reverse in future periods. usage
of these nols by the reorganized  company is limited to approximately $4 million
annually.  however,  the reorganized  company may authorize the use of other tax
planning  techniques  to utilize a portion of the  remaining  nols  before  they
expire. in any event, the reorganized  company expects that substantial  amounts
of the nols will expire unused.

the reorganized  company has tax credit  carryforwards  of  approximately  $16.9
million.  these tax credits  are  principally  foreign tax credit  carryforwards
resulting  from  inclusion  of  the  accumulated  earnings  and  profits  of the
reorganized  company's foreign  subsidiaries in u.s. taxable income in 1996. the
reorganized company expects that these credits will expire unused.

the tax benefits of pre-reorganization  net deferred tax assets will be reported
first as a reduction of "reorganization  value in excess of identifiable assets"
and then as a credit to equity.  these tax benefits  will not reduce  income tax
expense.

commitments and contingencies:

anacomp has  commitments  under  long-term  operating  leases,  principally  for
building space and data service center  equipment.  lease terms  generally cover
periods from five to twelve years.  the following  summarizes the future minimum
lease payments under all noncancelable  operating lease  obligations,  including
the unfavorable  lease  commitments and vacant  facilities  discussed in note 1,
which extend beyond one year:

the total of future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable subleases
related to the above  leases is  $752,000.  no material  losses in excess of the
liabilities recorded are expected in the future.

in november 1993,  anacomp and pennant systems,  a division of ibm,  announced a
joint effort to develop  software which will allow anacomp's xfp 2000 to process
and image ibm  advanced  function  presentation  ("afp")  formatted  data.  this
program  resulted  in the xfp  2000  being  able to  output  afp  data  streams,
including  those  containing  fonts,  logos,  signatures and other images,  onto
microfiche.

as consideration  for the development of the afp, anacomp paid pennant systems a
development  fee of $6.5  million.  anacomp  was also  required  to pay  pennant
systems minimum annual royalty  payments for the licensed  system  installations
for six years and for ongoing  system  support  which began in december 1995 and
continues  for 10 years.  during  1995,  anacomp  established  a reserve of $8.6
million for future payments to pennant systems for software  royalty and systems
support  obligations  which were not recoverable as more fully discussed in note
1. in connection with the company's  financial  restructuring  during 1996, this
contract was renegotiated  with pennant such that the reserve  requirements were
greatly  reduced.  the  renegotiated  contract  requires  anacomp to make future
license fee payments to pennant systems of $625,000 annually through fiscal year
1999, of which $0.6 million is reserved at 9/30/97.

the company sold $10.5 million of lease  receivables  in the twelve months ended
september 30, 1995. under the terms of the sale, the purchasers have recourse to
the company  should the  receivables  prove to be  uncollectable.  the amount of
recourse remaining at september 30, 1997 is $1.2 million.

anacomp  also is  involved  in various  claims and  lawsuits  incidental  to its
business and  management  believes that the outcome of any of those matters will
not have a material  adverse effect on its  consolidated  financial  position or
results of operations.

xidex  corporation,  a  predecessor  company of anacomp,  was  designated by the
united  states   environmental   protection  agency  ("epa")  as  a  potentially
responsible  party for  investigatory  and cleanup  costs  incurred by state and
federal  authorities  involving  locations  included on a list of epa's priority
sites for  investigation  and remedial  action  under the federal  comprehensive
environmental response,  compensation,  and liability act. the epa reserve noted
above   relates  to  its   estimated   liability   for  cleanup  costs  for  the
aforementioned  locations  and other sites.  no material  losses are expected in
excess of the liabilities recorded above.

note 20.
earnings (loss) per share:

the computation of earnings (loss) per share is based upon the weighted  average
number of common shares  outstanding during the period plus (in periods in which
they have a dilutive effect) the effect of common shares contingently  issuable,
primarily  from stock options and exercise of warrants.  fully diluted  earnings
(loss) per share also reflect  additional  dilution related to stock options due
to the use of the market  price at the end of the  period,  when higher than the
average price for the period.  for the twelve  months ended  september 30, 1997,
and the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  earnings per share is presented
based  on  the  weighted  average  shares   outstanding  before  the  effect  of
continently  issuable  shares,  stock  options  or  warrants  due to the  losses
reported for the periods.

the weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding and net income (loss)
per  common  share for  periods  prior to may 31,  1996 have not been  presented
because,  due to the reorganization and implementation of fresh start reporting,
they are not comparable to subsequent periods.

                management's discussion and analysis of financial
                       condition and results of operations


results of operations


         on may 20, 1996 the company's  reorganization plan was confirmed by the
united  states   bankruptcy  court  and  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy
reorganization.   the  plan  of  reorganization   resulted  in  a  reduction  of
approximately  $174 million in principal  and accrued  interest on the company's
debt  obligations  and  in  liquidation  amount  and  accrued  dividends  on its
preferred  stock.  as a  result  of the  reorganization,  the  recording  of the
restructuring  transaction and the implementation of fresh start reporting,  the
company's  results of  operations  after may 31,  1996 (the cutoff date used for
financial  reporting  purposes) are not comparable to results  reported in prior
periods.  see note 3 to the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements for
information on consummation of the plan of reorganization  and implementation of
fresh start reporting.


         to facilitate a meaningful  comparison  of the company's  quarterly and
year-to-date  operating  performance  in fiscal years 1997,  1996 and 1995,  the
following  discussion  of  results  of  operations  on a  consolidated  basis is
presented on a traditional comparative basis for all periods.  consequently, the
prior  years'  information  presented  below  does not  comply  with  accounting
requirements  for companies upon emergence from bankruptcy,  which  requirements
call  for  separate  reporting  for  the  newly  reorganized   company  and  the
predecessor company.

results of operations-fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995

         general

         anacomp  reported  a net  loss of  $67.8  million  for the  year  ended
september  30, 1997 as compared to net income of $143  million and a net loss of
$238.3  million for the years ended  september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
included in the fiscal 1997 net loss is non-cash  amortization  of the company's
reorganization  value asset of $75.8  million and an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment  of debt comprised of a 3% call premium and unamortized  discount
on the company's  existing 13% subordinated notes totalling $11.0 million net of
income taxes.

         pursuant to a 1990 oem  agreement  kodak was  obligated  to purchase an
additional  151 xfp 2000  systems by october  1997 or pay a cash  penalty to the
company.  the company and kodak  negotiated  an amendment to the oem  agreement,
whereby the company  accepted a $3.6 million  cash payment from kodak,  which is
included in the current period  results,  a commitment to purchase an additional
28 xfp 2000  systems by the end of  calendar  1997,  and a one-time  purchase of
spare parts. as of september 30, 1997, 12 systems remained to be purchased under
this  agreement.  kodak  purchased all the remaining xfp 2000 systems during the
quarter ended december 31, 1997.

         net  income  for  fiscal  1996  included   $25.7  million  in  non-cash
amortization  of the  company's  reorganization  value  asset,  a gain of  $92.8
million for  reorganization  items and an extraordinary  gain resulting from the
discharge of indebtedness of $52.4 million. included in the fiscal 1995 loss are
special charges of $136.9 million,  representing a write-off of goodwill of $108
million and $28.9 million of costs  associated with software  investments.  also
included in the fiscal 1995 loss is a $29 million  deferred  tax  provision  and
$32.7 million of restructuring charges.

         earnings before interest,  other income,  reorganization items, special
and   restructuring   charges,   taxes,   depreciation   and   amortization  and
extraordinary  items ("ebitda") was $83.7 million,  or 18.1% of revenues for the
year ended  september  30, 1997.  this compares to ebitda of $84.2  million,  or
17.3% of revenues,  and $77.4 million,  or 13.1% of revenues for the years ended
september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  excluding the kodak payment of $3.6
million  described  above,  ebitda was $80.1  million for the current  period or
17.5% of revenues.

         total  revenues  for fiscal  1997 of $462.5  million  represent a $23.6
million  decrease from fiscal 1996, which had experienced a decrease from fiscal
1995 of $105 million.  approximately $9.8 million of the fiscal 1997 decrease is
due to the  discontinuance  and downsizing of selected product lines,  including
ics ($1.5 million),  readers and reader/printers ($5.5 million), source document
film ($.5 million) and micrographics  accessories ($2.3 million).  the remaining
$13.8  million  decrease in revenues is due  primarily to the  expected  general
downward trend in both the  micrographics  supplies and magnetics  product lines
offset by revenue contributions from the company's  acquisitions and new digital
products.  approximately $60.1 million of the fiscal 1996 decrease is due to the
discontinuance  or  downsizing  of  certain  product  lines  including  ics ($20
million),  flexible  diskette media ($20.2  million),  reader and reader printer
products ($12.7 million) and source document film ($7.2 million).

         cost of services  provided as a percentage of services  revenue was 52%
in fiscal 1997, compared to 55% and 58% for fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
the decrease is due primarily to cost reduction efforts in maintenance  services
initiated by new management. cost of equipment and supplies sold as a percentage
of equipment and supplies  sales,  excluding  the one-time $3.6 million  payment
noted above, was 76% for fiscal years 1997 and 1996,  compared to 78% for fiscal
1995.

         selling,  general and  administrative  expenses were 20% of revenues in
fiscal 1997,  excluding the one-time $3.6 million payment noted above,  compared
to 19% in  fiscal  1996.  the  slight  increase  was  primarily  the  result  of
amortization  and transition  costs  associated  with the company's  fiscal 1997
acquisition activity.  selling,  general and administrative expenses were 22% of
revenues in fiscal 1995.

output services

         output  services  revenues  increased  $1.3  million  in  fiscal  1997,
compared  to fiscal  1996  (excluding  the effect of the ics sale).  com service
volumes  increased by 9% while  average  selling  prices  decreased by 12%. data
center  acquisitions  and several large customer gains have  contributed to both
the  increase  in volumes  and the  decrease in average  selling  prices.  gross
margins as a percentage of revenue  decreased by 3 percentage  points due to the
aforementioned  impact of lower average selling prices. output services revenues
were down $8.4  million in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal 1995  (excluding  the
effect of the ics sale),  primarily due to an 11% decrease in volume.  decreases
in average  selling  prices during fiscal 1996 also  adversely  affected  output
services gross margins as a percent of revenue,  which  decreased 1% from fiscal
1995 to fiscal  1996.  alva cd services  grew by $2.5 million in fiscal 1997 and
now comprise approximately 4% of total output services revenue as compared to 1%
in fiscal 1996.


technical services

         technical  services  (primarily  maintenance)  revenues  decreased $5.0
million in fiscal  1997,  compared to fiscal 1996 and $4.0  million  from fiscal
1995 to fiscal 1996, in part due to the effect of replacing older generation com
systems with the xfp, which has a significantly  greater capacity than the older
com  systems.  gross  margins as a percentage  of revenue  improved 7 percentage
points over the prior year in each of fiscal 1997 and 1996 primarily as a result
of the cost reduction efforts mentioned above.



<page>




output systems

         output  systems  revenues,  which is  comprised of both com and digital
output  systems,  increased $3.9 million in fiscal 1997 primarily as a result of
contributions  from the  company's  acquisition  of data/ware  in january  1997.
output systems gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by 12% due to
the  change  in  product  mix with a greater  portion  of sales  represented  by
refurbished sytems which have higher margins.

         com systems  revenues in fiscal 1997 decreased by $5.4 million compared
to fiscal 1996,  which had  experienced  an $18.5  million  decrease from fiscal
1995. included in com systems revenues for fiscal 1995 are $3.5 million in sales
of  equipment  for  use  in  anacomp  data  centers  under  sale  and  leaseback
arrangements.  the  company  sold or leased  135  xfp2000  units in fiscal  1997
compared to 122 and 156 in fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  the decrease in
revenue is  attributable  to an increase in 1997 in the number of units  shipped
under  operating  lease  arrangements,  and a decrease  in the number of systems
shipped under  straight  sales  arrangements  along with a change in the mix and
pricing  of new and  used  systems.  fiscal  1997 and 1996  gross  margins  as a
percentage of revenues  improved several  percentage points due to the change in
product mix.

         digital  systems  revenues  in fiscal 1997 were $9.3  million  with the
second quarter  acquisition of data/ware  contributing $6.4 million in revenues.
there were no digital systems sold during fiscal 1996 or 1995.


micrographics supplies

         micrographics  supplies revenues decreased $18.8 million in fiscal 1997
compared to fiscal 1996 consistent  with the projected  market trends for reader
and  reader/printers,  original com film,  duplicate film and other accessories.
gross margins as a percentage of revenue were comparable between periods.

micrographics supplies revenues decreased $40.2 million from fiscal 1996 to 1995
principally as a result of the  discontinuance  and downsizing of product lines,
as well as the projected market trends noted above. micrographics supplies gross
margins as a percent of revenue  increased 5% in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal
1995 as a  result  of  changes  in  product  mix due  primarily  to the sale and
downsizing of product lines.


magnetic media

         magnetic media revenues  decreased $9.4 million in fiscal 1997 compared
to fiscal 1996. the major product categories  experiencing a decrease in revenue
include 3480 tape cartridges  ($5.9 million),  open reel tape ($7.7 million) and
tk 50/52 tape ($2.0 million).  these decreases were partially  offset by the new
contributions  of $5.8 million from metal particle tape products.  gross margins
as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 1997  increased  slightly from fiscal 1996.
magnetic  media  revenues  decreased  $16.2  million in fiscal 1996  compared to
fiscal 1995. the decrease was due to the closure of the omaha, nebraska factory,
which produced  flexible  diskette  media, as well as reduced unit sales of open
reel tape.  magnetic media gross margins had remained level in fiscal years 1996
and 1995.

             interest expense

         interest expense and fee amortization of $35.9 million for fiscal 1997,
decreased  $3.7  million  over the prior year due to the  company's  refinancing
efforts  in  fiscal  1997 and its  improved  debt  structure  as a result of the
reorganization  in fiscal 1996.  interest  expense and fee amortization of $39.6
million for fiscal 1996,  decreased  $31.3 million  compared to fiscal 1995. the
decrease  relates to the  discontinuance  of interest accrued on the predecessor
company's old subordinated  debt during the bankruptcy  proceedings,  as well as
reduced interest expense on the new debt instruments.

         income taxes

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1997 includes $5.4 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $4.2 million of domestic taxes
after  considering the impact of the extrordinary  loss. of the $4.2 million net
domestic tax provision,  approximately  $0.7 million is currently  payable.  see
note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1996 includes $6.1 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $2 million of domestic  income
taxes  primarily  related to the non-cash charge in lieu of taxes of $1.3 milion
along with the alternative  minimum tax and state and local taxes. the effective
rate as a  percentage  of  income  before  reorganization  items,  extraordinary
credit, and cumulative effect of accounting change (8.2%) is lower than the u.s.
statutory rate because of non-taxable  reorganization income partially offset by
increases resulting from non-deductible amortization.

         included in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995 is a deferred
tax provision of $29 million.  the deferred tax  provision  includes u.s. tax on
undistributed foreign earnings of $9 million and a write-off of net deferred tax
assets of $20 million. this write-off results from the uncertainty regarding the
financial  restructuring that was in progress and, accordingly,  the uncertainty
regarding  the  ultimate   benefit  to  be  derived  from   anacomp's  tax  loss
carryforwards.  the  remaining  components  of the provision for income taxes in
fiscal  1995  were  taxes of $4.8  million  on  earnings  of  anacomp's  foreign
subsidiaries and a tax reserve adjustment of $1.2 million.

liquidity and capital resources

         during the period ended  september  30,  1997,  anacomp  completed  the
refinancing of  substantially  all of its significant debt obligations (see note
13 to the consolidated  financial  statements).  the refinancings will result in
significant  interest savings to the company.  anacomp's cash interest cost will
now  be  at  an  annual  rate  of  approximately  $30  million  as  compared  to
approximately  $40 million upon the  company's  exit from  bankruptcy on may 31,
1996. the company's debt amortization has also been  significantly  reduced as a
result of the refinancings.  anacomp made no principal  payments on the new debt
during fiscal 1997 and now has scheduled  principal  payments of $8.7 million in
fiscal 1998 and $13.8  million in fiscal  1999.  as of september  30, 1997,  the
current  portion of long-term debt was $9.6 million as compared to $31.8 million
at september 30, 1996.

         anacomp's working capital at september 30, 1997,  excluding the current
portion  of  long-term  debt was $41.4  million,  compared  to $26.4  million at
september 30, 1996. net cash provided by operating activities increased to $57.8
million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 1997,  compared to $49.8 million
in the comparable prior period. net cash used in investing  activities was $32.8
million in the  current  period,  compared  to net cash  provided  by  investing
activities  of $3.9  million in the  comparable  prior  period.  this change was
primarily the result of the company using $22.4 million of cash for acquisitions
in the current period while the company generated $13.6 million in cash from the
sale of the ics division in the prior period.  also,  the company  increased its
capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment by $4.6 million during
the current period.

     net cash used in  financing  activities  decreased  to $5.1 million for the
fiscal  year  ended  september  30,  1997,  compared  to  $35.5  million  in the
comparable   prior  period.   the  company's   successful   rights  offering  of
approximately  3.6 million shares of common stock provided  approximately  $24.5
million in cash in the current  period and the company's  debt  refinancing  and
principal  reductions used approximately  $30.1 million in net cash. fiscal 1996
financing  activities include a $13 million repayment of debt with proceeds from
the sale of the ics division and $24.9 million in principal reductions on debt.

         the company's cash balance (including  restricted cash) as of september
30, 1997 was $65.5 million, compared to $47.8 million at september 30, 1996. the
company  also has  availability  of $22.6  million on its $25 million  revolving
credit facility at september 30, 1997.

         the company has significant  debt service  obligations.  the ability of
the company to meet its debt service and other  obligations will depend upon its
future performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some
of which are beyond its control. however, the company believes that cash on hand
and cash generated from  operations  will be sufficient to fund its debt service
requirements,  acquisition  strategies and working  capital  requirements in the
foreseeable future.

accounting pronouncements

         in february  1997,  the  financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb)
issued a pronouncement related to the calculation and disclosure of earnings per
share  information.  this  pronouncement  is effective for periods  ending after
december  15,  1997 and,  consequently,  no  adjustments  are  reflected  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  for the period  ended  september  30, 1997.
adoption  of this  pronouncement  would  not have a  significant  impact  on eps
reported for the twelve month period ended september 30, 1997.

         in june 1997,  fasb  issued two  additional  pronouncements  related to
reporting comprehensive income and disclosure of segment information.  these two
pronouncements  are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 1997. the
company has not yet  determined  the  additional  disclosures  specified by this
pronouncement  on the  consolidated  financial  statements  for the period ended
september 30, 1977.

                    report of independent public accountants

to the board of directors and stockholders of anacomp, inc.:

         we  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
anacomp, inc. (an indiana corporation) and subsidiaries as of september 30, 1997
and 1996, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30, 1997,
the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  the eight months ended may 31, 1996
and the twelve months ended  september 30, 1995.  these  consolidated  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management.   our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

         we conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  an audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         as  more  fully  described  in  note  2 to the  consolidated  financial
statements,  effective june 4, 1996, the company emerged from  protection  under
chapter 11 of the u.s.  bankruptcy code pursuant to a reorganization  plan which
was confirmed by the bankruptcy  court on may 20, 1996. in accordance with aicpa
statement of position 90-7, the company adopted "fresh start reporting"  whereby
its assets,  liabilities  and new  capital  structure  were  adjusted to reflect
estimated  fair  values  as of may  31,  1996.  as a  result,  the  consolidated
financial  statements  for the periods  subsequent  to may 31, 1996  reflect the
successor  company's  new  basis of  accounting  and are not  comparable  to the
predecessor company's pre-reorganization consolidated financial statements.

         in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of anacomp,
inc.  and  subsidiaries  as of september  30, 1997 and 1996,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30,
1997,  the four months ended  september 30, 1996, the eight months ended may 31,
1996 and the twelve months ended september 30, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

         as  explained  in  note 1 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
effective  june 30, 1995,  the company  changed its method of accounting for the
measurement of goodwill impairment.

notes to consolidated
 financial statements
anacomp, inc. and subsidiaries


note 1.
summary of significant accounting policies:

consolidation

the  consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of anacomp,  inc.
("anacomp"  or  the  "company")  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  material
intercompany  transactions  have been  eliminated.  certain amounts in the prior
year consolidated  financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

due to the  reorganization  and  implementation  of fresh start  reporting,  the
consolidated  financial  statements for the reorganized company (period starting
may 31,  1996)  are not  comparable  to those of the  predecessor  company.  for
financial  reporting  purposes,   the  effective  date  of  the  emergence  from
bankruptcy is considered to be the close of business on may 31, 1996.

a  black  line  has  been  drawn  on  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements to distinguish  between the  reorganized  company and the predecessor
company.

foreign currency translation

substantially all assets and liabilities of anacomp's  international  operations
are  translated  at  the  year-end  exchange  rates;  income  and  expenses  are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. translation
adjustments  are  accumulated  in a separate  section of  stockholders'  equity.
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income.

segment reporting

anacomp operates in a single business segment providing equipment,  supplies and
services for document management, including storage, processing and retrieval.

significant estimates

the preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
actual results could differ from these estimates.

revenue recognition

revenues  from sales of products and  services or from lease of equipment  under
sales-type  leases are recorded  based on shipment of products or performance of
services.  under sales-type  leases, the present value of all payments due under
the lease  contracts  is recorded as revenue,  cost of sales is charged with the
book value of the equipment plus installation  costs, and future interest income
is deferred and  recognized  over the lease term.  operating  lease revenues are
recognized  during  the  applicable  period of  customer  usage.  revenues  from
maintenance  contracts  are  deferred and  recognized  in earnings on a pro rata
basis over the period of the agreements.

inventories

inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of  cost or  market,  with  cost  being
determined by methods approximating the first-in, first-out basis.

the cost of the inventories is distributed as follows:

restricted cash

restricted  cash  represents  cash reserved as collateral  for letters of credit
issued  by the  company  or cash  held in escrow  primarily  to  secure  certain
contingent  obligations of the company. the contingent obligations are primarily
related to environmental liabilities and certain insurance policies.

property and equipment

property and equipment are carried at cost.  depreciation  and  amortization  of
property and equipment are generally provided under the straight-line method for
financial  reporting  purposes over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or
the lease terms.  tooling costs are amortized over the total  estimated units of
production, not to exceed three years. in accordance with fresh start reporting,
property and equipment  were  reflected at fair market values as of may 31, 1996
(see note 3).

debt issuance costs

the company  capitalizes all costs related to its issuance of debt and amortizes
those costs  using the  effective  interest  method over the life of the related
debt instruments. unamortized debt issuance costs were $6.6 million at september
30, 1997 and are  included in "other  assets" in the  accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets.  during the twelve months ended  september 30, 1997,  the eight
months ended may 31, 1996 and the twelve months ended  september  30, 1995,  the
company  amortized $.9 million,  $1 million and $5.7 million,  respectively,  of
debt   issuance   costs  which  are  included  in  "interest   expense  and  fee
amortization" in the accompanying  consolidated statements of operations.  also,
in accordance  with aicpa  statement of position 90-7,  "financial  reporting by
entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy  code" (sop 90-7), the company
wrote off deferred  debt  issuance  costs of $11.1  million upon the date of the
bankruptcy  filing.  these costs are included in  "reorganization  items" in the
accompanying  consolidated  statements of operations  for the eight months ended
may 31, 1996.

goodwill

excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired  ("goodwill") is
amortized  on the  straight-line  method  over the  estimated  periods of future
demand for the related  products  acquired.  goodwill at  september  30, 1997 is
being amortized over periods of three to five years.  effective with fresh start
reporting, the company now measures impairment based on future cash flows of the
related products.

for the predecessor company,  effective june 30, 1995, anacomp elected to modify
its method of measuring goodwill impairment to a fair value approach.  if it was
determined that impairment had occurred,  the excess of the unamortized goodwill
over the fair value of the goodwill  applicable to the business unit was charged
to operations.  for purposes of determining  fair value,  the company valued the
goodwill  using a multiple of cash flow from  operations  based on  consultation
with its  investment  advisors.  anacomp  concluded that fair value was a better
measurement of goodwill  considering the company's  highly  leveraged  financial
condition. anacomp revised its projected operating results in fiscal 1995 which,
along with applying anacomp's revised goodwill accounting policy,  resulted in a
write-off  of $108 million of goodwill  for the year ended  september  30, 1995.
this   write-off  is  reflected  in  "special   charges"  in  the   accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

reorganization value in excess of amounts allocated to identifiable assets

as more fully  discussed  in note 3, the  company has  "reorganization  value in
excess of amounts  allocated to  identifiable  assets" of $163.9  million net of
accumulated  amortization of $101.4 million at september 30, 1997. this asset is
being  amortized  over a 3.5 year period  beginning  may 31, 1996.  the carrying
value of the reorganization asset will be periodically reviewed if the facts and
circumstances  suggest  that it may be  impaired.  the company  will measure the
impairment  based upon  future  cash  flows of the  company  over the  remaining
amortization period.


research and development

the  engineering  costs  associated  specifically  with research and development
programs are expensed as  incurred,  and amounted to $4.8 for the twelve  months
ended  september 30, 1997,  $1.3 million for the four months ended september 30,
1996,  $2.4 million for the eight months ended may 31, 1996 and $2.2 million for
the twelve  months  ended  september  30,  1995.  the company  supports  several
engineering   processes,   including  basic  technological   research,   product
development   and   sustaining   engineering   support  for  existing   customer
installations.  the majority of the operating costs for engineering  programs in
fiscal year 1995 related to continued software  development for the xfp 2000 com
recorder, which were recorded as deferred software costs.

deferred  software costs are the  capitalized  costs of software  products to be
sold in future  periods with com systems or as stand alone  products for current
com system users. the unamortized costs are evaluated for impairment each period
by  determining  their net realizable  value.  such costs are amortized over the
greater of the estimated units of sale or under the straight-line  method not to
exceed five years.  due to lower than  expected  sales of new software  products
introduced in 1995,  anacomp  revised its  projected  future sales and operating
results of software  products  through  1999.  as a result,  during 1995 anacomp
wrote off $20.3 million of deferred  software costs and established a reserve of
$8.6 million for future payments to ibm pennant systems for software royalty and
system support  obligations  which were not  recoverable  based on these revised
projections  (see note 17). these charges are reflected in "special  charges" in
the accompanying  consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
september  30,  1995.  unamortized  deferred  software  costs  remaining  as  of
september 30, 1997 total $2.5 million and are included in "other  assets" on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

sale-leaseback transactions

anacomp  entered  into  sale-leaseback  transactions  of $19.3  million  in 1995
relating to com systems installed in the company's data service centers. part of
the  proceeds  were  treated as fixed asset sales and the  remainder as sales of
equipment.  revenues of $3.5 million were recorded for the year ended  september
30,  1995.  all  profits  were  deferred  and  were  being  recognized  over the
applicable  leaseback  periods.  in  connection  with fresh start  reporting  as
discussed  in  note  3,  the  deferred   profit  amount  was  reduced  to  zero.
concurrently,  the company  established an unfavorable  lease reserve related to
these leases which is being amortized over the applicable lease periods.
at september 30, 1997 $4.4 million of this reserve remained to be amortized.

accrued lease reserves

other  noncurrent  liabilities  include  reserves  established  for  unfavorable
facility and equipment lease  commitments,  vacant facilities and related future
lease costs. total obligations  recorded for these unfavorable lease commitments
and future  lease and related  costs at their  estimated  amounts  were $6.2 and
$11.4 million at september 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  the current portion
of these  obligations  was $4.9 and $6.8  million as of  september  30, 1997 and
1996, respectively, and is included in "other accrued liabilities" and "accounts
payable" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

income taxes

anacomp  accounts for income taxes based on the  liability  method for computing
deferred income taxes. the benefit of certain loss  carryforwards  are estimated
and  recorded as an asset  unless it is "more  likely than not" that the benefit
will not be realized.

during 1995,  the valuation  allowance was increased to reduce the company's net
deferred tax asset to zero as a result of the company's  deteriorating financial
condition.

 in general, anacomp's practice has been to reinvest the earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries in those  operations and to repatriate  those earnings only when it
was  advantageous to do so. in 1995,  anacomp  changed its practice  whereby the
company now repatriates these earnings.  as a result,  anacomp recorded deferred
taxes of $8.8 million on all undistributed foreign earnings in 1995.

cash and cash equivalents

anacomp  considers  all highly  liquid  investments  purchased  with an original
maturity  of  three  months  or  less to be cash  equivalents.  these  temporary
investments,  primarily repurchase  agreements and other overnight  investments,
are recorded at cost, which approximates market.

note  2.
financial reorganization:

on may 20, 1996 (the "confirmation  date"), the u.s.  bankruptcy court confirmed
the company's third amended joint plan of reorganization (the "reorganization"),
and on june 4, 1996,  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  pursuant  to the
reorganization, on such date certain indebtedness of the company was canceled in
exchange  for cash,  new  indebtedness,  and /or new equity  interests,  certain
indebtedness was reinstated,  certain other prepetition  claims were discharged,
certain  claims were settled,  executory  contracts  and  unexpired  leases were
assumed or rejected,  and the members of a new board of directors of the company
were   designated.   the  company   simultaneously   distributed   to  creditors
approximately  $22  million  in cash,  $112.2  million  principal  amount of its
11-5/8%  senior  secured  notes due 1999 (the "senior  secured  notes") and $160
million  principal  amount of its 13%  senior  subordinated  notes due 2002 (the
"senior subordinated notes"),  equity securities consisting of 10 million shares
of new common  stock and 362,694  warrants,  each of which is  convertible  into
1.0566  shares of new common  stock  during the five year period  ending june 3,
2001 at an exercise price of $11.57 per share.

the process began january 5, 1996,  when anacomp filed a  prenegotiated  plan of
reorganization  with the u.s.  bankruptcy  court in delaware under chapter 11 of
the u.s.  bankruptcy code. the company was in default under substantially all of
its  debt  agreements  as a result  of its  failure  to make  $89.7  million  of
principal  payments  scheduled  for april 26,  1995 and  october 26, 1995 on the
senior  secured  credit  facilities  (including  $60  million  relating  to  the
revolving  loan agreement  which expired on october 26, 1995),  $11.4 million of
principal and interest  payments on the 9% convertible  subordinated  debentures
which were due january 15, 1996,  $34.1 million of interest  payments  scheduled
for may 1, 1995 and november 1, 1995 on its senior  subordinated notes, and $3.2
million of interest payments scheduled for july 15, 1995 and january 15, 1996 on
the  13.875%  subordinated  debentures,  as well as certain  financial  covenant
violations, and the cross-default provisions of the other debt agreements.

note  3.
fresh start reporting and bankruptcy reorganization:

as noted above,  upon emerging from  bankruptcy,  the company's  revolving loan,
multi-currency  revolving  loan, term loans,  series b senior notes,  15% senior
subordinated  notes,   13.875%  convertible   subordinated   debentures  and  9%
convertible  subordinated  debentures were canceled. in addition,  the company's
8.25% cumulative  convertible  redeemable  exchangeable  preferred stock, common
stock, warrants and stock options were canceled.  in connection  therewith,  the
company issued new debt and equity  securities as mentioned  above and described
in more detail in notes 13 and 15.


as of may 31, 1996, the company adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with
the american  institute of certified public  accountant's  statement of position
90-7  "financial  reporting by entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy
code" ("sop 90-7").  fresh start reporting  resulted in material  changes to the
condensed consolidated balance sheet, including valuation of assets,  intangible
assets  (including  goodwill) and liabilities at fair market value and valuation
of equity based on the appraised  reorganization  value of the ongoing business.
the net result of the  valuation of  identifiable  assets,  the  recognition  of
liabilities at fair market value and the valuation of equity was the reorganized
company  recognizing an asset  "reorganization  value in excess of  identifiable
assets" totaling $267.5 million as of may 31, 1996.











as a result of the bankruptcy  reorganization,  the predecessor company recorded
an  extraordinary  gain  resulting from the discharge of  indebtedness  of $52.4
million calculated as follows:

sale of ics division:

effective  november 1, 1995,  anacomp sold its ics  division  for  approximately
$13.5 million,  which resulted in a net gain to the company of $6.2 million that
is  reflected  in "other  income  (expense)"  in the  accompanying  consolidated
statement of  operations.  the  proceeds  from this sale were used to reduce the
principal  balance on certain  senior debt.  the ics division  performed  source
document  microfilm services at several facilities around the country generating
approximately $20 million of revenues per year.

note 5.
restructuring charges:

included in the operating  results for 1995 are  restructuring  charges of $32.7
million.  these  charges were the result of the  company's  reassessment  of its
strategy for ongoing  financial  improvement  and a decision to downsize or exit
certain  areas of its  business.  specifically,  the  company  closed its omaha,
nebraska  magnetic  media  manufacturing  facility,  exited the  manufacture  of
readers and reader/printers at its san diego, california  manufacturing facility
and reduced headcount  worldwide.  the restructuring  charges included severance
costs of $5.9  million,  which  included  personnel  related to magnetics  media
manufacturing,   reader  and  reader/printer  manufacturing  and  other  various
personnel associated with the worldwide headcount  reduction.  approximately 400
people were terminated  pursuant to these plans.  also included in restructuring
charges were inventory write downs of $9.1 million,  excess facility reserves of
$7.7 million and other  reserves of $10  million.  the company  completed  these
restructuring  activities  during fiscal 1996. the actual costs  associated with
the  restructuring  did not  vary  significantly  from the  previously  reported
amounts.


note 6.
financial restructuring costs:

on april 6, 1995,  anacomp announced that it had withdrawn its proposed offering
of $225 million  senior  secured notes and a related offer to purchase up to $50
million of the  company's  outstanding  15%  senior  subordinated  notes.  costs
directly  related to these  activities  of $6 million are included as "financial
restructuring costs" in the accompanying  consolidated  statements of operations

skc agreement:

anacomp has entered into a supply  agreement (the "supply  agreement")  with skc
america,  inc., a new jersey corporation ("skca"),  and skc limited ("skcl"), an
affiliated corporation of skca organized pursuant to the laws of the republic of
korea. skca and skcl are collectively referred to as "skc". the supply agreement
expires in december 2003.  pursuant to the supply  agreement,  anacomp purchases
substantially  all of its requirements for coated duplicate  microfilm from skc.
pursuant  to  the  supply  agreement,  skc  also  provides  the  company  with a
substantial  portion  of its  polyester  requirements  for  its  magnetic  media
products.

in connection  with the supply  agreement,  skc also provided the company with a
$25 million  trade  credit  facility  which was reduced to $15 million in fiscal
1997 (secured by up to $10 million of products sold to the company by skc),  all
of which is  outstanding  at september  30, 1997.  the trade credit  arrangement
bears interest at 1.75% over the prime rate of the first national bank of boston
(10.25% as of september 30, 1997).

in connection with an amendment to the supply agreement as of the effective date
under the plan of reorganization, the company agreed to certain price increases,
retroactive to 1994, and agreed to make the following  deferred payments related
to the retroactive  price increases to skc (which were accrued in "other accrued
liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets): (a) $400,000 paid
in 1997: (b) $600,000 due in 1998; (c) $800,000 due in 1999; (d) $800,000 due in

senior secured credit facility

on february 28, 1997, the company and certain foreign  subsidiaries entered into
a credit and guarantee  agreement  (the "credit  facility")  with a syndicate of
banks  and other  financial  institutions  (collectively,  the  "senior  secured
lenders"),  lehman commerical paper inc., as arranger and syndication agent, and
the  first  national  bank  of  chicago  (in  its  individual  capacity,  "first
chicago"),  as  administrative  agent.  the credit  facility  provides for a $55
million term loan facility  ("the term  facility")  and a $25 million  revolving
credit  facility (the "revolving  facility").  the proceeds of the term facility
and available  cash were used to repay the existing 11 5/8% senior secured notes
due 1999 (the "old senior secured notes"). the balance of the old senior secured
notes at february 28, 1997, was $83.6 million,  reflecting the prepayment of the
march 31, 1997 installment of $14.3 million made on february 20, 1997.

as of september 30, 1997, $55 million was  outstanding  under the term facility,
and $2.4  million  was  outstanding  under the  revolving  facility.  the entire
revolving  facility  is  available  for loans  denominated  in u.s.  dollars and
certain foreign currencies ("multicurrency loans"), and up to $10 million of the
revolving  facility is available for letters of credit of which $2.7 million was
outstanding  at september  30, 1997.  the term facility is repayable in thirteen
quarterly installments commencing march 31, 1998, with the final installment due
on march 31, 2001. the revolving facility terminates on february 28, 2001.

the  company may elect to have loans  under the term  facility or the  revolving
facility  bear  interest  at (a)  the  alternate  base  rate  plus 2% or (b) the
eurodollar rate, or in the case of multicurrency  loans, the eurocurrency  rate,
plus 3%. interest is payable quarterly and at the end of the interest period (as
defined in the credit facility). the "alternate base rate" for any day means the
higher of (i) the corporate base rate of interest announced by first chicago and
(ii) the federal funds rate published by the federal reserve bank of new york on
the next business day plus 1/2%. the  "eurodollar  rate" for any interest period
means (a) the  applicable  london  interbank  offered  rate for deposits in u.s.
dollars two business days prior to the first day of the interest  period divided
by (b) one minus the "eurocurrency  liabilities" under regulation d of the board
of governors of the federal  reserve  system.  the  "eurocurrency  rate" for any
interest  period means the rate at which first chicago  offers to place deposits
in the  applicable  foreign  currency  with  first-class  banks  in  the  london
interbank  market  two  business  days  prior to the first  day of the  interest
period.



the term facility and the revolving facility are secured by all of the company's
tangible and intangible assets (including  intellectual property,  real property
and all of the  capital  stock  of  each of the  company's  direct  or  indirect
domestic  subsidiaries  and 65% of the  capital  stock of each of the  company's
material direct foreign  subsidiaries).  all of the company's  obligations under
the credit facility are  unconditionally  guaranteed by the company's  direct or
indirect domestic subsidiaries.  in addition to customary covenants,  the credit
facility requires that the company:  (a) maintain certain ratios of consolidated
ebitda (as defined in the credit facility), (b) not incur any indebtedness other
than the 10 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2004 (the "notes"),  indebtedness
under the credit  facility and certain  other  indebtedness,  (c) not permit any
lien to exist on any of its  property,  assets or revenues,  except the liens in
favor of the senior secured lenders,  existing liens and certain other liens (d)
not to incur any guarantee obligations, except the guarantee obligations related
to the credit facility and certain other guarantee obligations and (e) prohibits
payment of dividends to common shareholders.

the  company  must use 25% of  consolidated  excess cash flow (as defined in the
credit  facility)  in  fiscal  1997 and 50% of  consolidated  excess  cash  flow
thereafter to repay the term facility and reduce revolving facility commitments.
additionally,  100% of the net proceeds  (as defined in the credit  facility) of
any asset sale (as defined in the credit  facility) and 75% of proceeds from the
sale of  capital  stock  (as  defined  in the  credit  facility)  not  used  for
acquisitions  or the repurchase of  subordinated  debt, must be applied to repay
the term  facility  and  reduce the  revolving  facility  commitments.  the term
facility repayment schedule, after considering the terms of the excess cash flow
requirements, is as follows:

10 7/8% senior subordinated notes

on  march  24,  1997,  the  company  issued  $200  million  of  10  7/8%  senior
subordinated  notes ("the  notes").  the notes were sold at 98.2071% of the face
amount to yield proceeds of $196.4 million.  the proceeds of the notes were used
to repay the existing  13% senior  subordinated  notes due 2002,  including a 3%
call  premium  and  accrued  interest,  to reduce  the skc trade  payable by $10
million and associated  accrued interest,  and to pay certain fees and expenses.
as a result of the call premium ($5.2 million) and existing  discount on the 13%
notes  ($11.6  million),  the  company  recorded  an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment of debt of $11.0 million, net of tax benefits.

the notes are not  redeemable  at the  option of the  company  prior to april 1,
2000. on or after such date until april 1, 2003, the notes will be redeemable at
the option of the company in whole or in part at prices ranging from 108.156% to
102.710% plus accrued and unpaid interest.  on or after april 1, 2003, the notes
may be  redeemable at 100% plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  prior to april 1,
2000,  the company may, at its option,  use the net cash proceeds of one or more
public equity  offerings (as defined in the  indenture),  to redeem up to 35% of
the  aggregate  principal  amount at a redemption  price equal to 110.875%  plus
unpaid  interest to the date of redemption,  provided that at least $130 million
of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued remains outstanding
after any such redemption.

also,  upon a change of control  (as defined in the  indenture),  the company is
required to make an offer to purchase the notes then  outstanding  at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the  principal  amount  thereof,  plus accrued and unpaid
interest.  the notes have no sinking  fund  requirements  and are due in full on
april 1, 2004.

the notes  are  general  unsecured  obligations  of the  company  and  expressly
subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior  indebtedness
(as defined in the  indenture)  of the  company.  the notes will rank pari passu
with any future senior  subordinated  indebtedness (as defined in the indenture)
and senior to all subordinated indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) of the
company.

the indenture relating to the notes contains covenants related to limitations of
indebtedness  of  the  company  and  restricted  subsidiaries,   limitations  on
restricted   payments,   limitations  on  restrictions  on  distributions   from
restricted subsidiaries, limitations on sale of assets and restricted subsidiary
stock,  limitations  on  liens,  a  prohibition  on  layering,   limitations  on
transactions with affiliates,  limitations on issuance and sale of capital stock
of restricted  subsidiaries,  limitations  of  sale/leaseback  transactions  and
prohibits payment of dividends to common shareholders.


note 14.
rights offering:

on october 30,  1996,  the company  completed a rights  offering to its existing
shareholders  that  resulted in the  issuance  of 3.6  million  shares of common
stock.  for each share of anacomp  common stock held as of the close of business
on  september  18,  1996,  the  company  distributed  0.36 rights to purchase an
additional  share of common stock at a  subscription  price of $6.875 per share.
the company is using the  proceeds  of the rights  offering,  approximately  $25
million, for the acquisition of businesses, assets and technologies.

note 15.
capital stock:

reorganized company

preferred stock

the board of  directors of the company has the ability,  at its  discretion,  to
create  one  or  more  series  of  preferred   stock  and  shall  determine  the
preferences,  limitations,  and relative  voting and other rights of one or more
series of preferred stock.

stock option plans

on july 22, 1996, the company's board of directors approved the 1996 restructure
recognition  incentive  plan.  under this plan,  effective  august 22, 1996, the
company  awarded to employees  947,500 stock options to acquire new common stock
and 99,050 shares of restricted new common stock.

with regard to the stock options,  the options were granted at an exercise price
of $4.63 per share of new common stock which will result in  approximately  $3.2
million of compensation  expense over the vesting period of the options based on
the  market  value of the stock at august  22,  1996.  75% of the  options  vest
ratably  during  the  period  from june 30,  1997 to june 30,  1999.  25% of the
options vest on september 30, 1999, provided certain performance goals have been
met;  otherwise  the  options  vest on june 30,  2003.  during  1997  and  1996,
approximately  $1  million  and  $200,000,   respectively,   was  recognized  as
compensation expense related to the options and the above noted restricted stock
award.  the options expire 10 years after the date of the grant. as of september
30, 1997, 164,950 options were exercisable.

with  regard to the  restricted  shares of new common  stock,  the  shares  vest
immediately  and thus the  company  recognized  approximately  $0.8  million  of
compensation  expense  immediately  upon  granting the award based on the market
value of the company's  stock on august 22, 1996. the shares are restricted from
sale or transfer by the  recipient  employees  until after  september  30, 1997.
effective  december 6, 1996,  34,650 shares of restricted stock were returned by
employees to the company.

in addition,  on february 3, 1997 the company's  shareholders  approved the 1996
long-term  incentive  plan,  which  provides for the future  issuance of various
forms of stock related awards including options,  stock appreciation  rights and
restricted shares. the company has reserved 1,400,000 shares of new common stock
for issuance  under this plan.  awards,  including  the nature of the awards and
related  exercise  prices,  are  to be  determined  at  the  discretion  of  the
compensation  committee of the board of directors  in  accordance  with the plan
provisions.

the company  accounts for its stock option plans in accordance  with apb opinion
no. 25 ("apb 25"),  under which  compensation  expense is recognized only to the
extent the exercise  price of the option is less than the fair market value of a
share of stock at the date of  grant.  during  1995,  the  financial  accounting
standards  board issued  statement of financial  accounting  standards  no. 123,
accounting for stock based  compensations  (sfas 123), which considers the stock
options as compensation expense to the company, based on their fair value at the
date of grant. under this new standard, the company has the option of accounting
for employee  stock  option plans as it currently  does or under the new method.
the company intends to continue to use the apb 25 method for accounting, but has
adopted the  disclosure  requirements  of sfas 123. had  compensation  costs for
these plans been  determined  consistant with sfas 123, the company's net income
would have been as follows:

stock option plans

anacomp's  stock option plans provided that the exercise price of the options be
determined by the board of directors (the "board"),  and in no case be less than
100% of fair market value at the time of grant for  qualified  options,  or less
than the par value of the stock for  non-qualified  options.  an option could be
exercised  subject to such  restrictions as the board may impose at the time the
option was granted. in any event, each option terminated not later than 10 years
after the date on which it was granted.

no shares were available for grant at may 31, 1996.  shares  available for grant
under the plans were 1,401,328 at september 30, 1995.

at september 30, 1997, the reorganized company has nols of approximately  $149.6
million available to offset future taxable income.  this amount will increase to
$199.1 million as certain temporary differences reverse in future periods. usage
of these nols by the reorganized  company is limited to approximately $4 million
annually.  however,  the reorganized  company may authorize the use of other tax
planning  techniques  to utilize a portion of the  remaining  nols  before  they
expire. in any event, the reorganized  company expects that substantial  amounts
of the nols will expire unused.

the reorganized  company has tax credit  carryforwards  of  approximately  $16.9
million.  these tax credits  are  principally  foreign tax credit  carryforwards
resulting  from  inclusion  of  the  accumulated  earnings  and  profits  of the
reorganized  company's foreign  subsidiaries in u.s. taxable income in 1996. the
reorganized company expects that these credits will expire unused.

the tax benefits of pre-reorganization  net deferred tax assets will be reported
first as a reduction of "reorganization  value in excess of identifiable assets"
and then as a credit to equity.  these tax benefits  will not reduce  income tax
expense.

the total of future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable subleases
related to the above  leases is  $752,000.  no material  losses in excess of the
liabilities recorded are expected in the future.

in november 1993,  anacomp and pennant systems,  a division of ibm,  announced a
joint effort to develop  software which will allow anacomp's xfp 2000 to process
and image ibm  advanced  function  presentation  ("afp")  formatted  data.  this
program  resulted  in the xfp  2000  being  able to  output  afp  data  streams,
including  those  containing  fonts,  logos,  signatures and other images,  onto
microfiche.

as consideration  for the development of the afp, anacomp paid pennant systems a
development  fee of $6.5  million.  anacomp  was also  required  to pay  pennant
systems minimum annual royalty  payments for the licensed  system  installations
for six years and for ongoing  system  support  which began in december 1995 and
continues  for 10 years.  during  1995,  anacomp  established  a reserve of $8.6
million for future payments to pennant systems for software  royalty and systems
support  obligations  which were not recoverable as more fully discussed in note
1. in connection with the company's  financial  restructuring  during 1996, this
contract was renegotiated  with pennant such that the reserve  requirements were
greatly  reduced.  the  renegotiated  contract  requires  anacomp to make future
license fee payments to pennant systems of $625,000 annually through fiscal year
1999, of which $0.6 million is reserved at 9/30/97.

the company sold $10.5 million of lease  receivables  in the twelve months ended
september 30, 1995. under the terms of the sale, the purchasers have recourse to
the company  should the  receivables  prove to be  uncollectable.  the amount of
recourse remaining at september 30, 1997 is $1.2 million.

anacomp  also is  involved  in various  claims and  lawsuits  incidental  to its
business and  management  believes that the outcome of any of those matters will
not have a material  adverse effect on its  consolidated  financial  position or
results of operations.

xidex  corporation,  a  predecessor  company of anacomp,  was  designated by the
united  states   environmental   protection  agency  ("epa")  as  a  potentially
responsible  party for  investigatory  and cleanup  costs  incurred by state and
federal  authorities  involving  locations  included on a list of epa's priority
sites for  investigation  and remedial  action  under the federal  comprehensive
environmental response,  compensation,  and liability act. the epa reserve noted
above   relates  to  its   estimated   liability   for  cleanup  costs  for  the
aforementioned  locations  and other sites.  no material  losses are expected in
excess of the liabilities recorded above.

note 20.
earnings (loss) per share:

the computation of earnings (loss) per share is based upon the weighted  average
number of common shares  outstanding during the period plus (in periods in which
they have a dilutive effect) the effect of common shares contingently  issuable,
primarily  from stock options and exercise of warrants.  fully diluted  earnings
(loss) per share also reflect  additional  dilution related to stock options due
to the use of the market  price at the end of the  period,  when higher than the
average price for the period.  for the twelve  months ended  september 30, 1997,
and the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  earnings per share is presented
based  on  the  weighted  average  shares   outstanding  before  the  effect  of
continently  issuable  shares,  stock  options  or  warrants  due to the  losses
reported for the periods.

the weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding and net income (loss)
per  common  share for  periods  prior to may 31,  1996 have not been  presented
because,  due to the reorganization and implementation of fresh start reporting,
they are not comparable to subsequent periods.

the  weighted  average  number of common and common  equivalent  shares  used to
compute earnings per share is:

                management's discussion and analysis of financial
                       condition and results of operations


results of operations


         on may 20, 1996 the company's  reorganization plan was confirmed by the
united  states   bankruptcy  court  and  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy
reorganization.   the  plan  of  reorganization   resulted  in  a  reduction  of
approximately  $174 million in principal  and accrued  interest on the company's
debt  obligations  and  in  liquidation  amount  and  accrued  dividends  on its
preferred  stock.  as a  result  of the  reorganization,  the  recording  of the
restructuring  transaction and the implementation of fresh start reporting,  the
company's  results of  operations  after may 31,  1996 (the cutoff date used for
financial  reporting  purposes) are not comparable to results  reported in prior
periods.  see note 3 to the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements for
information on consummation of the plan of reorganization  and implementation of
fresh start reporting.


         to facilitate a meaningful  comparison  of the company's  quarterly and
year-to-date  operating  performance  in fiscal years 1997,  1996 and 1995,  the
following  discussion  of  results  of  operations  on a  consolidated  basis is
presented on a traditional comparative basis for all periods.  consequently, the
prior  years'  information  presented  below  does not  comply  with  accounting
requirements  for companies upon emergence from bankruptcy,  which  requirements
call  for  separate  reporting  for  the  newly  reorganized   company  and  the
predecessor company.

results of operations-fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995

         general

         anacomp  reported  a net  loss of  $67.8  million  for the  year  ended
september  30, 1997 as compared to net income of $143  million and a net loss of
$238.3  million for the years ended  september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
included in the fiscal 1997 net loss is non-cash  amortization  of the company's
reorganization  value asset of $75.8  million and an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment  of debt comprised of a 3% call premium and unamortized  discount
on the company's  existing 13% subordinated notes totalling $11.0 million net of
income taxes.

         pursuant to a 1990 oem  agreement  kodak was  obligated  to purchase an
additional  151 xfp 2000  systems by october  1997 or pay a cash  penalty to the
company.  the company and kodak  negotiated  an amendment to the oem  agreement,
whereby the company  accepted a $3.6 million  cash payment from kodak,  which is
included in the current period  results,  a commitment to purchase an additional
28 xfp 2000  systems by the end of  calendar  1997,  and a one-time  purchase of
spare parts. as of september 30, 1997, 12 systems remained to be purchased under
this  agreement.  kodak  purchased all the remaining xfp 2000 systems during the
quarter ended december 31, 1997.

         net  income  for  fiscal  1996  included   $25.7  million  in  non-cash
amortization  of the  company's  reorganization  value  asset,  a gain of  $92.8
million for  reorganization  items and an extraordinary  gain resulting from the
discharge of indebtedness of $52.4 million. included in the fiscal 1995 loss are
special charges of $136.9 million,  representing a write-off of goodwill of $108
million and $28.9 million of costs  associated with software  investments.  also
included in the fiscal 1995 loss is a $29 million  deferred  tax  provision  and
$32.7 million of restructuring charges.

         earnings before interest,  other income,  reorganization items, special
and   restructuring   charges,   taxes,   depreciation   and   amortization  and
extraordinary  items ("ebitda") was $83.7 million,  or 18.1% of revenues for the
year ended  september  30, 1997.  this compares to ebitda of $84.2  million,  or
17.3% of revenues,  and $77.4 million,  or 13.1% of revenues for the years ended
september 30, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  excluding the kodak payment of $3.6
million  described  above,  ebitda was $80.1  million for the current  period or
17.5% of revenues.

         total  revenues  for fiscal  1997 of $462.5  million  represent a $23.6
million  decrease from fiscal 1996, which had experienced a decrease from fiscal
1995 of $105 million.  approximately $9.8 million of the fiscal 1997 decrease is
due to the  discontinuance  and downsizing of selected product lines,  including
ics ($1.5 million),  readers and reader/printers ($5.5 million), source document
film ($.5 million) and micrographics  accessories ($2.3 million).  the remaining
$13.8  million  decrease in revenues is due  primarily to the  expected  general
downward trend in both the  micrographics  supplies and magnetics  product lines
offset by revenue contributions from the company's  acquisitions and new digital
products.  approximately $60.1 million of the fiscal 1996 decrease is due to the
discontinuance  or  downsizing  of  certain  product  lines  including  ics ($20
million),  flexible  diskette media ($20.2  million),  reader and reader printer
products ($12.7 million) and source document film ($7.2 million).

         cost of services  provided as a percentage of services  revenue was 52%
in fiscal 1997, compared to 55% and 58% for fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
the decrease is due primarily to cost reduction efforts in maintenance  services
initiated by new management. cost of equipment and supplies sold as a percentage
of equipment and supplies  sales,  excluding  the one-time $3.6 million  payment
noted above, was 76% for fiscal years 1997 and 1996,  compared to 78% for fiscal
1995.

         selling,  general and  administrative  expenses were 20% of revenues in
fiscal 1997,  excluding the one-time $3.6 million payment noted above,  compared
to 19% in  fiscal  1996.  the  slight  increase  was  primarily  the  result  of
amortization  and transition  costs  associated  with the company's  fiscal 1997
acquisition activity.  selling,  general and administrative expenses were 22% of
revenues in fiscal 1995.

output services

         output  services  revenues  increased  $1.3  million  in  fiscal  1997,
compared  to fiscal  1996  (excluding  the effect of the ics sale).  com service
volumes  increased by 9% while  average  selling  prices  decreased by 12%. data
center  acquisitions  and several large customer gains have  contributed to both
the  increase  in volumes  and the  decrease in average  selling  prices.  gross
margins as a percentage of revenue  decreased by 3 percentage  points due to the
aforementioned  impact of lower average selling prices. output services revenues
were down $8.4  million in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal 1995  (excluding  the
effect of the ics sale),  primarily due to an 11% decrease in volume.  decreases
in average  selling  prices during fiscal 1996 also  adversely  affected  output
services gross margins as a percent of revenue,  which  decreased 1% from fiscal
1995 to fiscal  1996.  alva cd services  grew by $2.5 million in fiscal 1997 and
now comprise approximately 4% of total output services revenue as compared to 1%
in fiscal 1996.


technical services

         technical  services  (primarily  maintenance)  revenues  decreased $5.0
million in fiscal  1997,  compared to fiscal 1996 and $4.0  million  from fiscal
1995 to fiscal 1996, in part due to the effect of replacing older generation com
systems with the xfp, which has a significantly  greater capacity than the older
com  systems.  gross  margins as a percentage  of revenue  improved 7 percentage
points over the prior year in each of fiscal 1997 and 1996 primarily as a result
of the cost reduction efforts mentioned above.



<page>




output systems

         output  systems  revenues,  which is  comprised of both com and digital
output  systems,  increased $3.9 million in fiscal 1997 primarily as a result of
contributions  from the  company's  acquisition  of data/ware  in january  1997.
output systems gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by 12% due to
the  change  in  product  mix with a greater  portion  of sales  represented  by
refurbished sytems which have higher margins.

         com systems  revenues in fiscal 1997 decreased by $5.4 million compared
to fiscal 1996,  which had  experienced  an $18.5  million  decrease from fiscal
1995. included in com systems revenues for fiscal 1995 are $3.5 million in sales
of  equipment  for  use  in  anacomp  data  centers  under  sale  and  leaseback
arrangements.  the  company  sold or leased  135  xfp2000  units in fiscal  1997
compared to 122 and 156 in fiscal 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  the decrease in
revenue is  attributable  to an increase in 1997 in the number of units  shipped
under  operating  lease  arrangements,  and a decrease  in the number of systems
shipped under  straight  sales  arrangements  along with a change in the mix and
pricing  of new and  used  systems.  fiscal  1997 and 1996  gross  margins  as a
percentage of revenues  improved several  percentage points due to the change in
product mix.

         digital  systems  revenues  in fiscal 1997 were $9.3  million  with the
second quarter  acquisition of data/ware  contributing $6.4 million in revenues.
there were no digital systems sold during fiscal 1996 or 1995.


micrographics supplies

         micrographics  supplies revenues decreased $18.8 million in fiscal 1997
compared to fiscal 1996 consistent  with the projected  market trends for reader
and  reader/printers,  original com film,  duplicate film and other accessories.
gross margins as a percentage of revenue were comparable between periods.

micrographics supplies revenues decreased $40.2 million from fiscal 1996 to 1995
principally as a result of the  discontinuance  and downsizing of product lines,
as well as the projected market trends noted above. micrographics supplies gross
margins as a percent of revenue  increased 5% in fiscal 1996  compared to fiscal
1995 as a  result  of  changes  in  product  mix due  primarily  to the sale and
downsizing of product lines.


magnetic media

         magnetic media revenues  decreased $9.4 million in fiscal 1997 compared
to fiscal 1996. the major product categories  experiencing a decrease in revenue
include 3480 tape cartridges  ($5.9 million),  open reel tape ($7.7 million) and
tk 50/52 tape ($2.0 million).  these decreases were partially  offset by the new
contributions  of $5.8 million from metal particle tape products.  gross margins
as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 1997  increased  slightly from fiscal 1996.
magnetic  media  revenues  decreased  $16.2  million in fiscal 1996  compared to
fiscal 1995. the decrease was due to the closure of the omaha, nebraska factory,
which produced  flexible  diskette  media, as well as reduced unit sales of open
reel tape.  magnetic media gross margins had remained level in fiscal years 1996
and 1995.





<page>



             interest expense

         interest expense and fee amortization of $35.9 million for fiscal 1997,
decreased  $3.7  million  over the prior year due to the  company's  refinancing
efforts  in  fiscal  1997 and its  improved  debt  structure  as a result of the
reorganization  in fiscal 1996.  interest  expense and fee amortization of $39.6
million for fiscal 1996,  decreased  $31.3 million  compared to fiscal 1995. the
decrease  relates to the  discontinuance  of interest accrued on the predecessor
company's old subordinated  debt during the bankruptcy  proceedings,  as well as
reduced interest expense on the new debt instruments.

         income taxes

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1997 includes $5.4 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $4.2 million of domestic taxes
after  considering the impact of the extrordinary  loss. of the $4.2 million net
domestic tax provision,  approximately  $0.7 million is currently  payable.  see
note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

         the  provision for income taxes in fiscal 1996 includes $6.1 million on
earnings of anacomp's  foreign  subsidiaries  and $2 million of domestic  income
taxes  primarily  related to the non-cash charge in lieu of taxes of $1.3 milion
along with the alternative  minimum tax and state and local taxes. the effective
rate as a  percentage  of  income  before  reorganization  items,  extraordinary
credit, and cumulative effect of accounting change (8.2%) is lower than the u.s.
statutory rate because of non-taxable  reorganization income partially offset by
increases resulting from non-deductible amortization.

         included in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 1995 is a deferred
tax provision of $29 million.  the deferred tax  provision  includes u.s. tax on
undistributed foreign earnings of $9 million and a write-off of net deferred tax
assets of $20 million. this write-off results from the uncertainty regarding the
financial  restructuring that was in progress and, accordingly,  the uncertainty
regarding  the  ultimate   benefit  to  be  derived  from   anacomp's  tax  loss
carryforwards.  the  remaining  components  of the provision for income taxes in
fiscal  1995  were  taxes of $4.8  million  on  earnings  of  anacomp's  foreign

         during the period ended  september  30,  1997,  anacomp  completed  the
refinancing of  substantially  all of its significant debt obligations (see note
13 to the consolidated  financial  statements).  the refinancings will result in
significant  interest savings to the company.  anacomp's cash interest cost will
now  be  at  an  annual  rate  of  approximately  $30  million  as  compared  to
approximately  $40 million upon the  company's  exit from  bankruptcy on may 31,
1996. the company's debt amortization has also been  significantly  reduced as a
result of the refinancings.  anacomp made no principal  payments on the new debt
during fiscal 1997 and now has scheduled  principal  payments of $8.7 million in
fiscal 1998 and $13.8  million in fiscal  1999.  as of september  30, 1997,  the
current  portion of long-term debt was $9.6 million as compared to $31.8 million
at september 30, 1996.

         anacomp's working capital at september 30, 1997,  excluding the current
portion  of  long-term  debt was $41.4  million,  compared  to $26.4  million at
september 30, 1996. net cash provided by operating activities increased to $57.8
million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 1997,  compared to $49.8 million
in the comparable prior period. net cash used in investing  activities was $32.8
million in the  current  period,  compared  to net cash  provided  by  investing
activities  of $3.9  million in the  comparable  prior  period.  this change was
primarily the result of the company using $22.4 million of cash for acquisitions
in the current period while the company generated $13.6 million in cash from the
sale of the ics division in the prior period.  also,  the company  increased its
capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment by $4.6 million during
the current period.

     net cash used in  financing  activities  decreased  to $5.1 million for the
fiscal  year  ended  september  30,  1997,  compared  to  $35.5  million  in the
comparable   prior  period.   the  company's   successful   rights  offering  of
approximately  3.6 million shares of common stock provided  approximately  $24.5
million in cash in the current  period and the company's  debt  refinancing  and
principal  reductions used approximately  $30.1 million in net cash. fiscal 1996
financing  activities include a $13 million repayment of debt with proceeds from
the sale of the ics division and $24.9 million in principal reductions on debt.

         the company's cash balance (including  restricted cash) as of september
30, 1997 was $65.5 million, compared to $47.8 million at september 30, 1996. the
company  also has  availability  of $22.6  million on its $25 million  revolving
credit facility at september 30, 1997.

         the company has significant  debt service  obligations.  the ability of
the company to meet its debt service and other  obligations will depend upon its
future performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some
of which are beyond its control. however, the company believes that cash on hand
and cash generated from  operations  will be sufficient to fund its debt service
requirements,  acquisition  strategies and working  capital  requirements in the
foreseeable future.

accounting pronouncements

         in february  1997,  the  financial  accounting  standards  board (fasb)
issued a pronouncement related to the calculation and disclosure of earnings per
share  information.  this  pronouncement  is effective for periods  ending after
december  15,  1997 and,  consequently,  no  adjustments  are  reflected  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  for the period  ended  september  30, 1997.
adoption  of this  pronouncement  would  not have a  significant  impact  on eps
reported for the twelve month period ended september 30, 1997.

         in june 1997,  fasb  issued two  additional  pronouncements  related to
reporting comprehensive income and disclosure of segment information.  these two
pronouncements  are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 1997. the
company has not yet  determined  the  additional  disclosures  specified by this
pronouncement  on the  consolidated  financial  statements  for the period ended
september 30, 1977.

                    report of independent public accountants

to the board of directors and stockholders of anacomp, inc.:

         we  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
anacomp, inc. (an indiana corporation) and subsidiaries as of september 30, 1997
and 1996, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30, 1997,
the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  the eight months ended may 31, 1996
and the twelve months ended  september 30, 1995.  these  consolidated  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   company's   management.   our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

         we conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  an audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         as  more  fully  described  in  note  2 to the  consolidated  financial
statements,  effective june 4, 1996, the company emerged from  protection  under
chapter 11 of the u.s.  bankruptcy code pursuant to a reorganization  plan which
was confirmed by the bankruptcy  court on may 20, 1996. in accordance with aicpa
statement of position 90-7, the company adopted "fresh start reporting"  whereby
its assets,  liabilities  and new  capital  structure  were  adjusted to reflect
estimated  fair  values  as of may  31,  1996.  as a  result,  the  consolidated
financial  statements  for the periods  subsequent  to may 31, 1996  reflect the
successor  company's  new  basis of  accounting  and are not  comparable  to the
predecessor company's pre-reorganization consolidated financial statements.

         in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of anacomp,
inc.  and  subsidiaries  as of september  30, 1997 and 1996,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for the twelve months ended september 30,
1997,  the four months ended  september 30, 1996, the eight months ended may 31,
1996 and the twelve months ended september 30, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

         as  explained  in  note 1 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
effective  june 30, 1995,  the company  changed its method of accounting for the
measurement of goodwill impairment.

notes to consolidated
 financial statements
anacomp, inc. and subsidiaries


note 1.
summary of significant accounting policies:

consolidation

the  consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of anacomp,  inc.
("anacomp"  or  the  "company")  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  material
intercompany  transactions  have been  eliminated.  certain amounts in the prior
year consolidated  financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

due to the  reorganization  and  implementation  of fresh start  reporting,  the
consolidated  financial  statements for the reorganized company (period starting
may 31,  1996)  are not  comparable  to those of the  predecessor  company.  for
financial  reporting  purposes,   the  effective  date  of  the  emergence  from
bankruptcy is considered to be the close of business on may 31, 1996.

a  black  line  has  been  drawn  on  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements to distinguish  between the  reorganized  company and the predecessor
company.

foreign currency translation

substantially all assets and liabilities of anacomp's  international  operations
are  translated  at  the  year-end  exchange  rates;  income  and  expenses  are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. translation
adjustments  are  accumulated  in a separate  section of  stockholders'  equity.
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income.

segment reporting

anacomp operates in a single business segment providing equipment,  supplies and
services for document management, including storage, processing and retrieval.

significant estimates

the preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
actual results could differ from these estimates.

revenue recognition

revenues  from sales of products and  services or from lease of equipment  under
sales-type  leases are recorded  based on shipment of products or performance of
services.  under sales-type  leases, the present value of all payments due under
the lease  contracts  is recorded as revenue,  cost of sales is charged with the
book value of the equipment plus installation  costs, and future interest income
is deferred and  recognized  over the lease term.  operating  lease revenues are
recognized  during  the  applicable  period of  customer  usage.  revenues  from
maintenance  contracts  are  deferred and  recognized  in earnings on a pro rata
basis over the period of the agreements.



<page>



inventories

inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of  cost or  market,  with  cost  being
determined by methods approximating the first-in, first-out basis.

the cost of the inventories is distributed as follows:

restricted cash

restricted  cash  represents  cash reserved as collateral  for letters of credit
issued  by the  company  or cash  held in escrow  primarily  to  secure  certain
contingent  obligations of the company. the contingent obligations are primarily
related to environmental liabilities and certain insurance policies.

property and equipment

property and equipment are carried at cost.  depreciation  and  amortization  of
property and equipment are generally provided under the straight-line method for
financial  reporting  purposes over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or
the lease terms.  tooling costs are amortized over the total  estimated units of
production, not to exceed three years. in accordance with fresh start reporting,
property and equipment  were  reflected at fair market values as of may 31, 1996
(see note 3).

debt issuance costs

the company  capitalizes all costs related to its issuance of debt and amortizes
those costs  using the  effective  interest  method over the life of the related
debt instruments. unamortized debt issuance costs were $6.6 million at september
30, 1997 and are  included in "other  assets" in the  accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets.  during the twelve months ended  september 30, 1997,  the eight
months ended may 31, 1996 and the twelve months ended  september  30, 1995,  the
company  amortized $.9 million,  $1 million and $5.7 million,  respectively,  of
debt   issuance   costs  which  are  included  in  "interest   expense  and  fee
amortization" in the accompanying  consolidated statements of operations.  also,
in accordance  with aicpa  statement of position 90-7,  "financial  reporting by
entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy  code" (sop 90-7), the company
wrote off deferred  debt  issuance  costs of $11.1  million upon the date of the
bankruptcy  filing.  these costs are included in  "reorganization  items" in the
accompanying  consolidated  statements of operations  for the eight months ended
may 31, 1996.

goodwill

excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired  ("goodwill") is
amortized  on the  straight-line  method  over the  estimated  periods of future
demand for the related  products  acquired.  goodwill at  september  30, 1997 is
being amortized over periods of three to five years.  effective with fresh start
reporting, the company now measures impairment based on future cash flows of the
related products.

for the predecessor company,  effective june 30, 1995, anacomp elected to modify
its method of measuring goodwill impairment to a fair value approach.  if it was
determined that impairment had occurred,  the excess of the unamortized goodwill
over the fair value of the goodwill  applicable to the business unit was charged
to operations.  for purposes of determining  fair value,  the company valued the
goodwill  using a multiple of cash flow from  operations  based on  consultation
with its  investment  advisors.  anacomp  concluded that fair value was a better
measurement of goodwill  considering the company's  highly  leveraged  financial
condition. anacomp revised its projected operating results in fiscal 1995 which,
along with applying anacomp's revised goodwill accounting policy,  resulted in a
write-off  of $108 million of goodwill  for the year ended  september  30, 1995.
this   write-off  is  reflected  in  "special   charges"  in  the   accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

reorganization value in excess of amounts allocated to identifiable assets

as more fully  discussed  in note 3, the  company has  "reorganization  value in
excess of amounts  allocated to  identifiable  assets" of $163.9  million net of
accumulated  amortization of $101.4 million at september 30, 1997. this asset is
being  amortized  over a 3.5 year period  beginning  may 31, 1996.  the carrying
value of the reorganization asset will be periodically reviewed if the facts and
circumstances  suggest  that it may be  impaired.  the company  will measure the
impairment  based upon  future  cash  flows of the  company  over the  remaining
amortization period.


research and development

the  engineering  costs  associated  specifically  with research and development
programs are expensed as  incurred,  and amounted to $4.8 for the twelve  months
ended  september 30, 1997,  $1.3 million for the four months ended september 30,
1996,  $2.4 million for the eight months ended may 31, 1996 and $2.2 million for
the twelve  months  ended  september  30,  1995.  the company  supports  several
engineering   processes,   including  basic  technological   research,   product
development   and   sustaining   engineering   support  for  existing   customer
installations.  the majority of the operating costs for engineering  programs in
fiscal year 1995 related to continued software  development for the xfp 2000 com
recorder, which were recorded as deferred software costs.

deferred  software costs are the  capitalized  costs of software  products to be
sold in future  periods with com systems or as stand alone  products for current
com system users. the unamortized costs are evaluated for impairment each period
by  determining  their net realizable  value.  such costs are amortized over the
greater of the estimated units of sale or under the straight-line  method not to
exceed five years.  due to lower than  expected  sales of new software  products
introduced in 1995,  anacomp  revised its  projected  future sales and operating
results of software  products  through  1999.  as a result,  during 1995 anacomp
wrote off $20.3 million of deferred  software costs and established a reserve of
$8.6 million for future payments to ibm pennant systems for software royalty and
system support  obligations  which were not  recoverable  based on these revised
projections  (see note 17). these charges are reflected in "special  charges" in
the accompanying  consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
september  30,  1995.  unamortized  deferred  software  costs  remaining  as  of
september 30, 1997 total $2.5 million and are included in "other  assets" on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

sale-leaseback transactions

anacomp  entered  into  sale-leaseback  transactions  of $19.3  million  in 1995
relating to com systems installed in the company's data service centers. part of
the  proceeds  were  treated as fixed asset sales and the  remainder as sales of
equipment.  revenues of $3.5 million were recorded for the year ended  september
30,  1995.  all  profits  were  deferred  and  were  being  recognized  over the
applicable  leaseback  periods.  in  connection  with fresh start  reporting  as
discussed  in  note  3,  the  deferred   profit  amount  was  reduced  to  zero.
concurrently,  the company  established an unfavorable  lease reserve related to
these leases which is being amortized over the applicable lease periods.
at september 30, 1997 $4.4 million of this reserve remained to be amortized.

accrued lease reserves

other  noncurrent  liabilities  include  reserves  established  for  unfavorable
facility and equipment lease  commitments,  vacant facilities and related future
lease costs. total obligations  recorded for these unfavorable lease commitments
and future  lease and related  costs at their  estimated  amounts  were $6.2 and
$11.4 million at september 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  the current portion
of these  obligations  was $4.9 and $6.8  million as of  september  30, 1997 and
1996, respectively, and is included in "other accrued liabilities" and "accounts
payable" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

income taxes

anacomp  accounts for income taxes based on the  liability  method for computing
deferred income taxes. the benefit of certain loss  carryforwards  are estimated
and  recorded as an asset  unless it is "more  likely than not" that the benefit
will not be realized.

during 1995,  the valuation  allowance was increased to reduce the company's net
deferred tax asset to zero as a result of the company's  deteriorating financial
condition.

 in general, anacomp's practice has been to reinvest the earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries in those  operations and to repatriate  those earnings only when it
was  advantageous to do so. in 1995,  anacomp  changed its practice  whereby the
company now repatriates these earnings.  as a result,  anacomp recorded deferred
taxes of $8.8 million on all undistributed foreign earnings in 1995.

cash and cash equivalents

anacomp  considers  all highly  liquid  investments  purchased  with an original
maturity  of  three  months  or  less to be cash  equivalents.  these  temporary
investments,  primarily repurchase  agreements and other overnight  investments,
are recorded at cost, which approximates market.

note  2.
financial reorganization:

on may 20, 1996 (the "confirmation  date"), the u.s.  bankruptcy court confirmed
the company's third amended joint plan of reorganization (the "reorganization"),
and on june 4, 1996,  the  company  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  pursuant  to the
reorganization, on such date certain indebtedness of the company was canceled in
exchange  for cash,  new  indebtedness,  and /or new equity  interests,  certain
indebtedness was reinstated,  certain other prepetition  claims were discharged,
certain  claims were settled,  executory  contracts  and  unexpired  leases were
assumed or rejected,  and the members of a new board of directors of the company
were   designated.   the  company   simultaneously   distributed   to  creditors
approximately  $22  million  in cash,  $112.2  million  principal  amount of its
11-5/8%  senior  secured  notes due 1999 (the "senior  secured  notes") and $160
million  principal  amount of its 13%  senior  subordinated  notes due 2002 (the
"senior subordinated notes"),  equity securities consisting of 10 million shares
of new common  stock and 362,694  warrants,  each of which is  convertible  into
1.0566  shares of new common  stock  during the five year period  ending june 3,
2001 at an exercise price of $11.57 per share.

the process began january 5, 1996,  when anacomp filed a  prenegotiated  plan of
reorganization  with the u.s.  bankruptcy  court in delaware under chapter 11 of
the u.s.  bankruptcy code. the company was in default under substantially all of
its  debt  agreements  as a result  of its  failure  to make  $89.7  million  of
principal  payments  scheduled  for april 26,  1995 and  october 26, 1995 on the
senior  secured  credit  facilities  (including  $60  million  relating  to  the
revolving  loan agreement  which expired on october 26, 1995),  $11.4 million of
principal and interest  payments on the 9% convertible  subordinated  debentures
which were due january 15, 1996,  $34.1 million of interest  payments  scheduled
for may 1, 1995 and november 1, 1995 on its senior  subordinated notes, and $3.2
million of interest payments scheduled for july 15, 1995 and january 15, 1996 on
the  13.875%  subordinated  debentures,  as well as certain  financial  covenant
violations, and the cross-default provisions of the other debt agreements.

note  3.
fresh start reporting and bankruptcy reorganization:

as noted above,  upon emerging from  bankruptcy,  the company's  revolving loan,
multi-currency  revolving  loan, term loans,  series b senior notes,  15% senior
subordinated  notes,   13.875%  convertible   subordinated   debentures  and  9%
convertible  subordinated  debentures were canceled. in addition,  the company's
8.25% cumulative  convertible  redeemable  exchangeable  preferred stock, common
stock, warrants and stock options were canceled.  in connection  therewith,  the
company issued new debt and equity  securities as mentioned  above and described
in more detail in notes 13 and 15.


as of may 31, 1996, the company adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with
the american  institute of certified public  accountant's  statement of position
90-7  "financial  reporting by entities in  reorganization  under the bankruptcy
code" ("sop 90-7").  fresh start reporting  resulted in material  changes to the
condensed consolidated balance sheet, including valuation of assets,  intangible
assets  (including  goodwill) and liabilities at fair market value and valuation
of equity based on the appraised  reorganization  value of the ongoing business.
the net result of the  valuation of  identifiable  assets,  the  recognition  of
liabilities at fair market value and the valuation of equity was the reorganized
company  recognizing an asset  "reorganization  value in excess of  identifiable
assets" totaling $267.5 million as of may 31, 1996.











as a result of the bankruptcy  reorganization,  the predecessor company recorded
an  extraordinary  gain  resulting from the discharge of  indebtedness  of $52.4
million calculated as follows:

sale of ics division:

effective  november 1, 1995,  anacomp sold its ics  division  for  approximately
$13.5 million,  which resulted in a net gain to the company of $6.2 million that
is  reflected  in "other  income  (expense)"  in the  accompanying  consolidated
statement of  operations.  the  proceeds  from this sale were used to reduce the
principal  balance on certain  senior debt.  the ics division  performed  source
document  microfilm services at several facilities around the country generating
approximately $20 million of revenues per year.

note 5.
restructuring charges:

included in the operating  results for 1995 are  restructuring  charges of $32.7
million.  these  charges were the result of the  company's  reassessment  of its
strategy for ongoing  financial  improvement  and a decision to downsize or exit
certain  areas of its  business.  specifically,  the  company  closed its omaha,
nebraska  magnetic  media  manufacturing  facility,  exited the  manufacture  of
readers and reader/printers at its san diego, california  manufacturing facility
and reduced headcount  worldwide.  the restructuring  charges included severance
costs of $5.9  million,  which  included  personnel  related to magnetics  media
manufacturing,   reader  and  reader/printer  manufacturing  and  other  various
personnel associated with the worldwide headcount  reduction.  approximately 400
people were terminated  pursuant to these plans.  also included in restructuring
charges were inventory write downs of $9.1 million,  excess facility reserves of
$7.7 million and other  reserves of $10  million.  the company  completed  these
restructuring  activities  during fiscal 1996. the actual costs  associated with
the  restructuring  did not  vary  significantly  from the  previously  reported
amounts.


note 6.
financial restructuring costs:

on april 6, 1995,  anacomp announced that it had withdrawn its proposed offering
of $225 million  senior  secured notes and a related offer to purchase up to $50
million of the  company's  outstanding  15%  senior  subordinated  notes.  costs
directly  related to these  activities  of $6 million are included as "financial

set  forth  below,  each of which  has been  accounted  for as a  purchase.  the
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business
from the date of  acquisition.  pro forma  results of  operations  have not been

or the stock of nine businesses. total consideration was $25.5 million, of which
approximately  $18.3  million was assigned to excess of purchase  price over net
assets acquired.  the aggregate purchase prices consisted of $22.4 million cash,
$1.6 million in assumed liabilities and contingent cash and/or stock payments of
up to $10.0  million  based upon future  operating  results over the next two to
five years.

fiscal 1996

skc agreement:

anacomp has entered into a supply  agreement (the "supply  agreement")  with skc
america,  inc., a new jersey corporation ("skca"),  and skc limited ("skcl"), an
affiliated corporation of skca organized pursuant to the laws of the republic of
korea. skca and skcl are collectively referred to as "skc". the supply agreement
expires in december 2003.  pursuant to the supply  agreement,  anacomp purchases
substantially  all of its requirements for coated duplicate  microfilm from skc.
pursuant  to  the  supply  agreement,  skc  also  provides  the  company  with a
substantial  portion  of its  polyester  requirements  for  its  magnetic  media
products.

in connection  with the supply  agreement,  skc also provided the company with a
$25 million  trade  credit  facility  which was reduced to $15 million in fiscal

of which is  outstanding  at september  30, 1997.  the trade credit  arrangement
bears interest at 1.75% over the prime rate of the first national bank of boston
(10.25% as of september 30, 1997).

senior secured credit facility

on february 28, 1997, the company and certain foreign  subsidiaries entered into
a credit and guarantee  agreement  (the "credit  facility")  with a syndicate of
banks  and other  financial  institutions  (collectively,  the  "senior  secured
lenders"),  lehman commerical paper inc., as arranger and syndication agent, and
the  first  national  bank  of  chicago  (in  its  individual  capacity,  "first
chicago"),  as  administrative  agent.  the credit  facility  provides for a $55
million term loan facility  ("the term  facility")  and a $25 million  revolving
credit  facility (the "revolving  facility").  the proceeds of the term facility
and available  cash were used to repay the existing 11 5/8% senior secured notes
due 1999 (the "old senior secured notes"). the balance of the old senior secured
notes at february 28, 1997, was $83.6 million,  reflecting the prepayment of the
march 31, 1997 installment of $14.3 million made on february 20, 1997.

as of september 30, 1997, $55 million was  outstanding  under the term facility,
and $2.4  million  was  outstanding  under the  revolving  facility.  the entire
revolving  facility  is  available  for loans  denominated  in u.s.  dollars and
certain foreign currencies ("multicurrency loans"), and up to $10 million of the
revolving  facility is available for letters of credit of which $2.7 million was
outstanding  at september  30, 1997.  the term facility is repayable in thirteen
quarterly installments commencing march 31, 1998, with the final installment due
on march 31, 2001. the revolving facility terminates on february 28, 2001.

the  company may elect to have loans  under the term  facility or the  revolving
facility  bear  interest  at (a)  the  alternate  base  rate  plus 2% or (b) the
eurodollar rate, or in the case of multicurrency  loans, the eurocurrency  rate,
plus 3%. interest is payable quarterly and at the end of the interest period (as
defined in the credit facility). the "alternate base rate" for any day means the
higher of (i) the corporate base rate of interest announced by first chicago and
(ii) the federal funds rate published by the federal reserve bank of new york on
the next business day plus 1/2%. the  "eurodollar  rate" for any interest period
means (a) the  applicable  london  interbank  offered  rate for deposits in u.s.
dollars two business days prior to the first day of the interest  period divided
by (b) one minus the "eurocurrency  liabilities" under regulation d of the board
of governors of the federal  reserve  system.  the  "eurocurrency  rate" for any
interest  period means the rate at which first chicago  offers to place deposits
in the  applicable  foreign  currency  with  first-class  banks  in  the  london
interbank  market  two  business  days  prior to the first  day of the  interest
period.



the term facility and the revolving facility are secured by all of the company's
tangible and intangible assets (including  intellectual property,  real property
and all of the  capital  stock  of  each of the  company's  direct  or  indirect
domestic  subsidiaries  and 65% of the  capital  stock of each of the  company's
material direct foreign  subsidiaries).  all of the company's  obligations under
the credit facility are  unconditionally  guaranteed by the company's  direct or
indirect domestic subsidiaries.  in addition to customary covenants,  the credit
facility requires that the company:  (a) maintain certain ratios of consolidated
ebitda (as defined in the credit facility), (b) not incur any indebtedness other
than the 10 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2004 (the "notes"),  indebtedness
under the credit  facility and certain  other  indebtedness,  (c) not permit any
lien to exist on any of its  property,  assets or revenues,  except the liens in
favor of the senior secured lenders,  existing liens and certain other liens (d)
not to incur any guarantee obligations, except the guarantee obligations related
to the credit facility and certain other guarantee obligations and (e) prohibits
payment of dividends to common shareholders.

the  company  must use 25% of  consolidated  excess cash flow (as defined in the
credit  facility)  in  fiscal  1997 and 50% of  consolidated  excess  cash  flow
thereafter to repay the term facility and reduce revolving facility commitments.
additionally,  100% of the net proceeds  (as defined in the credit  facility) of
any asset sale (as defined in the credit  facility) and 75% of proceeds from the
sale of  capital  stock  (as  defined  in the  credit  facility)  not  used  for
acquisitions  or the repurchase of  subordinated  debt, must be applied to repay
the term  facility  and  reduce the  revolving  facility  commitments.  the term
facility repayment schedule, after considering the terms of the excess cash flow
requirements, is as follows:

10 7/8% senior subordinated notes

on  march  24,  1997,  the  company  issued  $200  million  of  10  7/8%  senior
subordinated  notes ("the  notes").  the notes were sold at 98.2071% of the face
amount to yield proceeds of $196.4 million.  the proceeds of the notes were used
to repay the existing  13% senior  subordinated  notes due 2002,  including a 3%
call  premium  and  accrued  interest,  to reduce  the skc trade  payable by $10
million and associated  accrued interest,  and to pay certain fees and expenses.
as a result of the call premium ($5.2 million) and existing  discount on the 13%
notes  ($11.6  million),  the  company  recorded  an  extraordinary  loss on the
extinguishment of debt of $11.0 million, net of tax benefits.

the notes are not  redeemable  at the  option of the  company  prior to april 1,
2000. on or after such date until april 1, 2003, the notes will be redeemable at
the option of the company in whole or in part at prices ranging from 108.156% to
102.710% plus accrued and unpaid interest.  on or after april 1, 2003, the notes
may be  redeemable at 100% plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  prior to april 1,
2000,  the company may, at its option,  use the net cash proceeds of one or more
public equity  offerings (as defined in the  indenture),  to redeem up to 35% of
the  aggregate  principal  amount at a redemption  price equal to 110.875%  plus
unpaid  interest to the date of redemption,  provided that at least $130 million
of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued remains outstanding
after any such redemption.

also,  upon a change of control  (as defined in the  indenture),  the company is
required to make an offer to purchase the notes then  outstanding  at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the  principal  amount  thereof,  plus accrued and unpaid
interest.  the notes have no sinking  fund  requirements  and are due in full on
april 1, 2004.

the notes  are  general  unsecured  obligations  of the  company  and  expressly
subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior  indebtedness
(as defined in the  indenture)  of the  company.  the notes will rank pari passu
with any future senior  subordinated  indebtedness (as defined in the indenture)
and senior to all subordinated indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) of the
company.

the indenture relating to the notes contains covenants related to limitations of
indebtedness  of  the  company  and  restricted  subsidiaries,   limitations  on
restricted   payments,   limitations  on  restrictions  on  distributions   from
restricted subsidiaries, limitations on sale of assets and restricted subsidiary
stock,  limitations  on  liens,  a  prohibition  on  layering,   limitations  on
transactions with affiliates,  limitations on issuance and sale of capital stock
of restricted  subsidiaries,  limitations  of  sale/leaseback  transactions  and
prohibits payment of dividends to common shareholders.


note 14.
rights offering:

on october 30,  1996,  the company  completed a rights  offering to its existing
shareholders  that  resulted in the  issuance  of 3.6  million  shares of common
stock.  for each share of anacomp  common stock held as of the close of business
on  september  18,  1996,  the  company  distributed  0.36 rights to purchase an
additional  share of common stock at a  subscription  price of $6.875 per share.
the company is using the  proceeds  of the rights  offering,  approximately  $25
million, for the acquisition of businesses, assets and technologies.

note 15.
capital stock:

reorganized company

preferred stock

the board of  directors of the company has the ability,  at its  discretion,  to
create  one  or  more  series  of  preferred   stock  and  shall  determine  the
preferences,  limitations,  and relative  voting and other rights of one or more
series of preferred stock.

stock option plans

on july 22, 1996, the company's board of directors approved the 1996 restructure
recognition  incentive  plan.  under this plan,  effective  august 22, 1996, the
company  awarded to employees  947,500 stock options to acquire new common stock
and 99,050 shares of restricted new common stock.

with regard to the stock options,  the options were granted at an exercise price
of $4.63 per share of new common stock which will result in  approximately  $3.2
million of compensation  expense over the vesting period of the options based on
the  market  value of the stock at august  22,  1996.  75% of the  options  vest
ratably  during  the  period  from june 30,  1997 to june 30,  1999.  25% of the
options vest on september 30, 1999, provided certain performance goals have been
met;  otherwise  the  options  vest on june 30,  2003.  during  1997  and  1996,
approximately  $1  million  and  $200,000,   respectively,   was  recognized  as
compensation expense related to the options and the above noted restricted stock
award.  the options expire 10 years after the date of the grant. as of september
30, 1997, 164,950 options were exercisable.

with  regard to the  restricted  shares of new common  stock,  the  shares  vest
immediately  and thus the  company  recognized  approximately  $0.8  million  of
compensation  expense  immediately  upon  granting the award based on the market
value of the company's  stock on august 22, 1996. the shares are restricted from
sale or transfer by the  recipient  employees  until after  september  30, 1997.
effective  december 6, 1996,  34,650 shares of restricted stock were returned by
employees to the company.

in addition,  on february 3, 1997 the company's  shareholders  approved the 1996
long-term  incentive  plan,  which  provides for the future  issuance of various
forms of stock related awards including options,  stock appreciation  rights and
restricted shares. the company has reserved 1,400,000 shares of new common stock
for issuance  under this plan.  awards,  including  the nature of the awards and
related  exercise  prices,  are  to be  determined  at  the  discretion  of  the
compensation  committee of the board of directors  in  accordance  with the plan
provisions.

the company  accounts for its stock option plans in accordance  with apb opinion
no. 25 ("apb 25"),  under which  compensation  expense is recognized only to the
extent the exercise  price of the option is less than the fair market value of a
share of stock at the date of  grant.  during  1995,  the  financial  accounting
standards  board issued  statement of financial  accounting  standards  no. 123,
accounting for stock based  compensations  (sfas 123), which considers the stock
options as compensation expense to the company, based on their fair value at the
date of grant. under this new standard, the company has the option of accounting
for employee  stock  option plans as it currently  does or under the new method.
the company intends to continue to use the apb 25 method for accounting, but has
adopted the  disclosure  requirements  of sfas 123. had  compensation  costs for
these plans been  determined  consistant with sfas 123, the company's net income
would have been as follows:

purchase  or 85% of the fair  market  value on the first  day of each  quarterly
offering  period.  a maximum of 500,000  shares of common stock is available for
purchase  under the stock  purchase  plan.  no shares are scheduled to be issued
prior to march 31, 1998.

determined by the board of directors (the "board"),  and in no case be less than
100% of fair market value at the time of grant for  qualified  options,  or less
than the par value of the stock for  non-qualified  options.  an option could be
exercised  subject to such  restrictions as the board may impose at the time the
option was granted. in any event, each option terminated not later than 10 years
after the date on which it was granted.

no shares were available for grant at may 31, 1996.  shares  available for grant
under the plans were 1,401,328 at september 30, 1995.

at september 30, 1997, the reorganized company has nols of approximately  $149.6
million available to offset future taxable income.  this amount will increase to
$199.1 million as certain temporary differences reverse in future periods. usage
of these nols by the reorganized  company is limited to approximately $4 million
annually.  however,  the reorganized  company may authorize the use of other tax
planning  techniques  to utilize a portion of the  remaining  nols  before  they
expire. in any event, the reorganized  company expects that substantial  amounts
of the nols will expire unused.

the reorganized  company has tax credit  carryforwards  of  approximately  $16.9
million.  these tax credits  are  principally  foreign tax credit  carryforwards
resulting  from  inclusion  of  the  accumulated  earnings  and  profits  of the
reorganized  company's foreign  subsidiaries in u.s. taxable income in 1996. the
reorganized company expects that these credits will expire unused.

the tax benefits of pre-reorganization  net deferred tax assets will be reported
first as a reduction of "reorganization  value in excess of identifiable assets"
and then as a credit to equity.  these tax benefits  will not reduce  income tax
expense.

commitments and contingencies:

anacomp has  commitments  under  long-term  operating  leases,  principally  for
building space and data service center  equipment.  lease terms  generally cover
periods from five to twelve years.  the following  summarizes the future minimum
lease payments under all noncancelable  operating lease  obligations,  including
the unfavorable  lease  commitments and vacant  facilities  discussed in note 1,
which extend beyond one year:

the total of future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable subleases
related to the above  leases is  $752,000.  no material  losses in excess of the
liabilities recorded are expected in the future.

in november 1993,  anacomp and pennant systems,  a division of ibm,  announced a
joint effort to develop  software which will allow anacomp's xfp 2000 to process
and image ibm  advanced  function  presentation  ("afp")  formatted  data.  this
program  resulted  in the xfp  2000  being  able to  output  afp  data  streams,
including  those  containing  fonts,  logos,  signatures and other images,  onto
microfiche.

as consideration  for the development of the afp, anacomp paid pennant systems a
development  fee of $6.5  million.  anacomp  was also  required  to pay  pennant
systems minimum annual royalty  payments for the licensed  system  installations
for six years and for ongoing  system  support  which began in december 1995 and
continues  for 10 years.  during  1995,  anacomp  established  a reserve of $8.6
million for future payments to pennant systems for software  royalty and systems
support  obligations  which were not recoverable as more fully discussed in note
1. in connection with the company's  financial  restructuring  during 1996, this
contract was renegotiated  with pennant such that the reserve  requirements were
greatly  reduced.  the  renegotiated  contract  requires  anacomp to make future
license fee payments to pennant systems of $625,000 annually through fiscal year
1999, of which $0.6 million is reserved at 9/30/97.

the company sold $10.5 million of lease  receivables  in the twelve months ended
september 30, 1995. under the terms of the sale, the purchasers have recourse to
the company  should the  receivables  prove to be  uncollectable.  the amount of
recourse remaining at september 30, 1997 is $1.2 million.

anacomp  also is  involved  in various  claims and  lawsuits  incidental  to its
business and  management  believes that the outcome of any of those matters will
not have a material  adverse effect on its  consolidated  financial  position or
results of operations.

xidex  corporation,  a  predecessor  company of anacomp,  was  designated by the
united  states   environmental   protection  agency  ("epa")  as  a  potentially
responsible  party for  investigatory  and cleanup  costs  incurred by state and
federal  authorities  involving  locations  included on a list of epa's priority
sites for  investigation  and remedial  action  under the federal  comprehensive
environmental response,  compensation,  and liability act. the epa reserve noted
above   relates  to  its   estimated   liability   for  cleanup  costs  for  the
aforementioned  locations  and other sites.  no material  losses are expected in
excess of the liabilities recorded above.

note 20.
earnings (loss) per share:

the computation of earnings (loss) per share is based upon the weighted  average
number of common shares  outstanding during the period plus (in periods in which
they have a dilutive effect) the effect of common shares contingently  issuable,
primarily  from stock options and exercise of warrants.  fully diluted  earnings
(loss) per share also reflect  additional  dilution related to stock options due
to the use of the market  price at the end of the  period,  when higher than the
average price for the period.  for the twelve  months ended  september 30, 1997,
and the four months ended  september  30, 1996,  earnings per share is presented
based  on  the  weighted  average  shares   outstanding  before  the  effect  of
continently  issuable  shares,  stock  options  or  warrants  due to the  losses
reported for the periods.

the weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding and net income (loss)
per  common  share for  periods  prior to may 31,  1996 have not been  presented
because,  due to the reorganization and implementation of fresh start reporting,
they are not comparable to subsequent periods.
