                                   (unaudited)


1.     basis of presentation:
       ----------------------
          in the opinion of management,  the accompanying unaudited consolidated
       condensed  financial  statements  of  ames  department  stores,  inc.  (a
       delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries  (collectively  "ames"  or  the
       "company")  contain  all  adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring
       adjustments)   necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  of  such  financial
       statements  for  the  interim  periods.  due  to the  seasonality  of the
       company's  operations,  the  results of its  operations  for the  interim
       period ended  october 31, 1998 may not be indicative of total results for
       the full year.  certain  information  and footnote  disclosures  normally
       included in financial  statements  prepared in accordance  with generally
       accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
       the rules and  regulations  promulgated  by the  securities  and exchange
       commission (the "sec"). certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
       to  conform  to  the   presentation   used  for  the  current  year.  the
       consolidated  condensed  balance  sheet at january 31, 1998 was  obtained
       from audited  financial  statements  previously filed with the sec in the
       company's  latest  form 10-k.  the  accompanying  unaudited  consolidated
       condensed  financial  statements  should be read in conjunction  with the
       financial  statements and notes thereto  included in the company's latest
       form 10-k.

2.     net income per common share:
       ----------------------------
          net income per share was determined  using the weighted average number
       of common shares  outstanding.  29,169 warrants were converted and 21,550
       options were exercised during the quarter ended october 31, 1998.  during
       the quarter ended october 25, 1997,  376,949  warrants were converted and
       273,650 options were exercised.

3.     inventories:
       ------------
          inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower of cost or market.  effective
       october 25, 1997,  the company changed from the retail last-in, first-out
      (lifo) method of accounting for inventories  to  the  first-in,  first-out
      (fifo) method and restated all prior periods for  the  change.  the change
       had no impact on the historical results of operations of the company.

4.     debt:
       -----
          on december 27,  1996,  the company  entered  into an  agreement  with
       bankamerica business credit,  inc., as agent, two financial  institutions
       as co-agents  (together with the agent,  the  "agents"),  and a syndicate
       consisting of five other banks and financial institutions,  for a secured
       revolving credit facility of up to $320 million,  with a sublimit of $100
       million  for  letters  of credit  and a $20  million  term  loan  portion
       available for capital expenditures (the "credit agreement").

          the credit  agreement is in effect until june 30, 2000,  is secured by
       substantially all of the assets of the company,  and requires the company
       to meet certain financial covenants.  in addition,  each year outstanding
       borrowings  under the credit  agreement  may not exceed any  balance  due
       under the term loan portion plus up to $20 million in revolver  loans for
       a consecutive  30-day period  between  november 15th and february 15th of
       the  following  year.  the company is in  compliance  with the  financial
       covenants through the quarter ended october 31, 1998.

<page>

          as of october 31, 1998,  borrowings of $136.1 million were outstanding
       under the  credit  agreement.  in  addition,  $19.5 and $2.6  million  of
       standby and trade letters of credit, respectively, were outstanding under
       the  credit  agreement.  the  weighted  average  interest  rates  on  the
       borrowings for the thirteen and thirty-nine  weeks ended october 31, 1998
       were 7.3% and 7.6% respectively. the peak borrowing level through october
       31, 1998 was $148.3 million.

          the amount of borrowing  under the credit  agreement  shall not exceed
       the sum of (i) an amount  equal to 60% of  inventory  not  covered by any
       outstanding  letter  of  credit  plus  (ii)  an  amount  equal  to 50% of
       inventory covered by any outstanding  letter of credit. in addition,  the
       credit  agreement  provides  for the  potential  establishment  of  other
       reserves contingent upon the company's financial performance. each agent,
       in  addition,  reserves  the right to adjust  the total  available  to be
       borrowed by  establishing  reserves,  making  determinations  of eligible
       inventory,  revising  standards of eligibility or decreasing from time to
       time the percentages set forth above. reference can be made to the latest
       form  10-k for  further  descriptions  of the  credit  agreement  and for
       descriptions of the company's other obligations not discussed herein.

 5.    stock options:
       --------------
          the company has three stock  option plans (the  "option  plans"):  the
       1994 management  stock option plan, the 1998  management  stock incentive
       plan and the 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan.

          in october 1995, the financial  accounting standards board issued sfas
       no.123 "accounting for stock-based compensation." sfas no.123 establishes
       a fair-value  based method of accounting  for  stock-based  compensation;
       however,   it  allows  entities  to  continue   accounting  for  employee
       stock-based  compensation  under the intrinsic value method prescribed by
       accounting  principles board opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued
       to employees."  the company elected to account for the option plans under
       apb opinion no. 25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized,
       and adopt sfas no. 123 through disclosure.

          if the  company  had elected to  recognize  compensation  cost for the
       option  plans based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under
       those plans,  consistent with the method  prescribed by sfas no. 123, net
       income and net income per diluted  common  share would have  approximated
       the pro forma amounts indicated below:


                                 for the thirteen        for the thirty-nine
                                   weeks ended               weeks ended

          the fair value of stock  options  used to compute pro forma net income
       and net income per diluted common share is the estimated present value at
       grant  date  using  the  black-scholes   option-pricing  model  with  the
       following  weighted  average  assumptions:  no dividend  yield,  expected
       option  volatilities,  a risk-free  interest rate equal to u.s.  treasury
       securities  with a maturity  equal to the expected life of the option and
       an expected life from date of grant until option expiration date.

6.     income taxes:
       -------------
          the company's estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year
       was applied to the income  before income taxes for each period to compute
       a non-cash  income tax provision.  the income tax provisions are included
       as  additions  to paid-in  capital on the  balance  sheet for all periods
       presented.

 7.    litigation:
       -----------
          reference  can be  made  to  the  latest  form  10-k  (note  12 to the
       consolidated  financial  statements) for various litigation involving the
       company,  for which there were no material  changes since the filing date
       of the form 10-k, except as follows:

          with regard to the second  complaint (the austin matter),  on july 15,
       1998, the court  approved a class action  settlement  (the  "settlement")
       which had been reached by the  parties.  notices of the  settlement  were
       sent to all potential  class members on august 19, 1998.  the  settlement
       provides that in exchange for a release of all claims against the company
       each class member who elected to opt-in to the settlement  will receive a
       benefit,  either cash or discounts on future  purchases at an ames store,
       based on the  number of days  worked  for the  company  during  the class
       period.  individuals who wished to opt-in to the settlement were required
       to sign and return a consent  and  release  form on or before  october 3,
       1998.  the maximum cost of the  settlement  to the company  cannot exceed
       $1.5  million in cash if all  participants  elect cash or $4.5 million in
       discounts on purchases if all participants  elect discounts.  the company
       believes it has adequately reserved for the settlement.

          with regard to the fifth complaint (the moschelle matter), pursuant to
       the terms of the  settlement,  the parties  jointly moved to dismiss this
       action  without  prejudice  to the rights of any class member who did not
       elect to opt-in to the  settlement  by the stated  deadline and the court
       has granted the motion.

 8. treasury stock:
    ---------------
          on august 10,  1998,  the  company's  board  of  directors  approved a
       stock repurchase program and authorized management to purchase up  to 1.5
       million common shares.   during the quarter ended  october 31, 1998,  the
       company acquired 76,481 shares of its common stock.  during the course of
       the quarter,  as a consequence of ongoing discussions with  hills  stores
       company, the company was precluded from making further purchases.

 9. subsequent event:
    -----------------
          on  november  12,  1998,  the company  announced  that it had signed a
       definitive   agreement   pursuant  to  which  the   company,   through  a
       wholly-owned  subsidiary,  hsc  acquisition  corp.,  would  acquire hills
       stores company ("hills"). under the terms of the transaction, the company
       has commenced a tender offer for all 11.2 million  outstanding  shares of
       hills' stock,  including the series a convertible  preferred stock,  (the
       "equity"),  at a price of $1.50 per share, and a separate tender offer at
       $550 (including  accrued  interest and consent fees) per $1,000 principal
       amount,  for  hills'  12 1/2 % senior  subordinated  notes  due 2003 (the
       "notes"),  of which there is $195 million in the  aggregate  outstanding.
       the company  will also share with the holders of the equity and the notes
       a potential recovery in the form of deferred  contingent cash rights with
       regard to litigation  initiated by hills against certain of hills' former
       directors.  any  potential  recovery  will be  divided  as  follows:  50%
       noteholders, 25% equity holders, and 25% ames.

<page>

          the transaction is contingent on each of the following: (i) the tender
       of at least 60% of the equity; (ii) the tender of at least 66 2/3% of the
       notes;  (iii)  the  consent  of at  least  66  2/3% of the  notes  to the
       modification  or elimination of certain  covenants;  and (iv)  regulatory
       approval and other customary closing conditions.

          the  acquisition,  if  consummated,  will be  accounted  for under the
       purchase method of accounting.  in connection with the  acquisition,  the
       company has  arranged for a new 42 month $650  million  revolving  credit
       facility   which  will  be  used:  (i)  to  refinance  the  secured  debt
       outstanding under the company's and hills'  existing  credit  facilities;
      (ii) to finance the purchase of the equity and the notes; (iii) to finance
       the  post-acquisition  remodeling and pre-opening  program for the hills'
       stores;  and (iv) to provide for the ongoing working capital needs of the
       company subsequent to the acquisition.

1997. during fiscal 1998, six (6) stores were opened, two (2) stores were closed
and  one (1)  store  was  temporarily  closed  as a  result  of a  fire.  in the
comparable prior-year period, nine (9) stores were opened,  thirteen (13) stores
were  closed  and the  company  determined  that it would  not  re-open  a store
previously closed as a result of flooding.

          net sales for the  thirteen  weeks ended  october  31, 1998  increased
       $71.6 million or 13.6% from the prior-year's  third quarter due primarily
       to an increase of 12.0% in comparable-store sales and the net addition of
       three (3) stores.  net sales for the thirty-nine  weeks ended october 31,
       1998 increased $170.8 million or 11.7% as compared to the same prior-year
       period.   comparable-store   sales   increased  by  9.6%  for  the  first
       thirty-nine weeks.

          gross  margin  increased  $15.0  million  and  $44.6  million  for the
       thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended october 31, 1998,  respectively,  as
       compared  to the  same  prior-year  periods.  gross  margin  rates,  as a
       percentage  of net  sales,  decreased  90 and 30  basis  points  for  the
       thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended october 31, 1998,  respectively,  as
       compared  to  the  same  prior-year  periods.  gross  margin  rates  were
       unfavorably  impacted by a higher percentage of sales consisting of lower
       margin items.

          selling,  general and  administrative  expenses for the thirteen weeks
       ended october 31, 1998  increased  $9.2 million,  but decreased 170 basis
       points as a  percentage  of net  sales  compared  to the same  prior-year
       period due primarily to net sales increases. the percentage decrease also
       reflected   a   favorable    performance   in   advertising   and   lower
       compensation-related  expenses  partially  offset by  increases in health
       insurance and  volume-related  expenses  compared to the same  prior-year
       period.   for  the  thirty-nine   week  period,   selling,   general  and
       administrative  expenses increased $31.9 million, but decreased 100 basis
       points as a  percentage  of net sales as compared to the same  prior-year
       period due primarily to favorable  performances  in store and advertising
       expenses.

          depreciation  and amortization  expense  increased by $1.2 million but
       remained flat as a percentage of net sales,  in the thirteen  weeks ended
       october  31,  1998,  compared  to the  same  prior-year  period.  for the
       thirty-nine  weeks ended october 31, 1998,  depreciation and amortization
       increased  $2.9 million or 10 basis points as a percentage  of net sales,
       compared with the same  prior-year  period.  the adoption of  fresh-start
       reporting as of december 26, 1992 resulted in the write-off of all of the
       company's non-current assets at that date, and therefore depreciation and
       amortization expense results only from capital additions after that date.

          the  amortization  of the excess of  revalued  net assets  over equity
       under  fresh-start  reporting  remained  the same in the current  periods
       presented as compared to the prior year.  the company is amortizing  this
       amount over a ten-year period.

          interest and debt  expense,  net of interest  income,  increased  $0.1
       million,  but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales, for
       the thirteen weeks ended october 31, 1998 as compared to the period ended
       october 31,  1997.  the  increase in interest  and debt  expenses was due
       primarily  to the  addition  of capital  lease  obligations  incurred  in
       connection  with  the  company's  installation  of new  store  automation
       systems and point-of-sale terminals (the "pos capital leases"), partially
       offset  by  lower  short-term  borrowing  rates  and the  payment  of the
       mortgage on the  distribution  center in mansfield,  ma, (the  "mansfield
       mortgage").  for the thirty-nine  weeks ended october 31, 1998,  interest
       and debt expense decreased $0.3 million but remained flat as a percentage
       of net sales,  compared with the same prior-year period. the reduction in
       year-to-date  interest and debt  expense was  attributable,  in part,  to
       lower  short-term  interest  rates  and  the  payment  of  the  mansfield
       mortgage, partially offset by the addition of the pos capital leases.

          the company's estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year
       was applied to the income  before income taxes for each period to compute
       a non-cash  income tax provision.  the income tax provisions are included
       as  additions  to paid-in  capital on the  balance  sheet for all periods
       presented.

liquidity and capital resources
- -------------------------------
          on december 27,  1996,  the company  entered  into an  agreement  with
       bankamerica business credit,  inc., as agent, two financial  institutions
       as co-agents  (together with the agent,  the  "agents"),  and a syndicate
       consisting of five other banks and financial institutions,  for a secured
       revolving credit facility of up to $320 million,  with a sublimit of $100
       million for letters of credit (the "credit agreement").

          the credit agreement is in effect until june 30, 2000. the company was
       in  compliance  with the  financial  covenants  of the  credit  agreement
       through the quarter ended october 31, 1998. reference can be made to note
       4 of  this  quarterly  report  and  the  latest  form  10-k  for  further
       descriptions of the credit agreement.

          merchandise inventories, increased $26.0 million from october 25, 1997
       to  october  31,  1998 due  primarily  to planned  increases  and the net
       addition  of three new stores.  the  increase  in  inventories  of $187.4
       million  from  january 31, 1998 to october 31, 1998 was  principally  the
       result of the normal seasonal build-up of inventories.

          trade accounts  payable  increased $17.0 million from october 25, 1997
       to  october  31,  1998  primarily  due to planned  merchandise  inventory
       increases,  the net  addition  of three new  stores  and  improved  trade
       payment  terms.  the  increase of $75.2  million from january 31, 1998 to
       october  31,  1998 was  principally  the  result of the  normal  seasonal
       build-up of merchandise inventories referenced above, the net addition of
       three new stores and improved trade payment terms.

          capital expenditures totaled $64.2 million (including $24.3 million in
       pos capital leases) for the thirty-nine weeks ended october 31, 1998. for
       the  balance  of the  year,  capital  expenditures  are  estimated  to be
       approximately $21 million.

          on  august 10,  1998,  the  company's  board of  directors  approved a
       stock  repurchase  program  and  authorized  management  to  purchase  up
       to 1.5 million common shares.  during the quarter ended october 31, 1998,
       the company acquired 76,481 shares of its common stock. during the course
       of the quarter, as a consequence of ongoing discussions with hills stores
       company, the company was precluded from making further purchases.

          the net operating loss  carryovers  remaining  after fiscal year 1997,
       subject to any  limitations  pursuant to internal  revenue code sec. 382,
       should offset income on which taxes would  otherwise be payable in future
       years.

          the company  believes that available cash and expected cash flows from
       the current fiscal year's operations and beyond,  and the availability of
       its  financing  facilities,  will enable the company to fund its expected
       needs  for  working  capital,   capital  expenditures  and  debt  service
       requirements.

accounting pronouncements
- -------------------------
          in april 1998, the accounting  standards  executive  committee (acsec)
       issued  statement  of  position  (sop) 98-5,  "reporting  on the costs of
       start-up  activities."  the sop is effective  for fiscal years  beginning
       after  december 15, 1998 although  earlier  adoption is allowed.  the sop
       will require  that the costs of start-up  activities,  excluding  capital
       expenditures, be expensed as incurred. the company currently expenses the
       costs  associated  with the  opening  of new  stores in the year they are
       opened.  these costs are carried as prepaid expenses prior to the opening
       of the new stores.  the  company  expects to adopt sop 98-5 as of january
       30, 1999 and does not anticipate the adoption will materially  affect the
       company's results of operations or financial position.

year 2000
- ---------
          as  previously  reported,  the company has  initiated a  comprehensive
       program to prepare its  computer  systems and  applications  for the year
       2000.  the  assessment  phase of the  company's  remediation  program  is
       complete and the systems  development and testing stages are in progress.
       the  company  has  spent  approximately  $3.1  million  on its year  2000
       initiatives to date and expects that full  implementation  of the program
       will involve an additional $2 to $3 million for conversion and testing of
       systems.  these costs  include  incremental  expenses  such as  software,
       outside  consulting  and other  expenses.  additionally,  the company has
       allocated existing systems development staff to year 2000 initiatives and
       estimates  these  internal  costs to be $3 to $4 million over the life of
       the project.

          the  company  has  formally  communicated  with all of its vendors and
       suppliers to determine  the extent to which the company may be vulnerable
       to any third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues. as
       previously  disclosed,  the first phase, which included sending year 2000
       surveys and questionnaires, is complete and the response evaluation phase
       is  currently in progress.  the company has not had  sufficient  response
       from  vendors  to  provide  an  estimate  of  the  potential   impact  of
       non-compliance  on the part of such  vendors.  management is currently in
       the final stages of developing  contingency plans which include,  but are
       not limited to, securing alternative vendors who are year 2000 compliant,
       developing  manual  merchandise   ordering   processes,   and  evaluating
       alternative merchandise assortments. it is too early to determine to what
       extent, if any, these contingency plans will have to be implemented.

          although the company expects to be year 2000 compliant by mid-1999 and
       does not expect to be  materially  impacted by the external  environment,
       such  future  events  cannot be known with  certainty.  furthermore,  the
       company's  estimates of future remediation costs and completion dates are
       based on presently available information and may be updated as additional
       information becomes available.

subsequent event
- ----------------
          on  november  12,  1998,  the company  announced  that it had signed a
       definitive   agreement   pursuant  to  which  the   company,   through  a
       wholly-owned  subsidiary,  hsc  acquisition  corp.,  would  acquire hills
       stores company ("hills"). under the terms of the transaction, the company
       has commenced a tender offer for all 11.2 million  outstanding  shares of
       hills' stock,  including the series a convertible  preferred stock,  (the
       "equity"),  at a price of $1.50 per share, and a separate tender offer at
       $550 (including  accrued  interest and consent fees) per $1,000 principal
       amount,  for  hills'  12 1/2 % senior  subordinated  notes  due 2003 (the
       "notes"),  of which there is $195 million in the  aggregate  outstanding.
       the company  will also share with the holders of the equity and the notes
       a potential recovery in the form of deferred  contingent cash rights with
       regard to litigation  initiated by hills against certain of hills' former
       directors.  any  potential  recovery  will be  divided  as  follows:  50%
       noteholders, 25% equity holders, and 25% ames.

          the transaction is contingent on each of the following: (i) the tender
       of at least 60% of the equity; (ii) the tender of at least 66 2/3% of the
       notes;  (iii)  the  consent  of at  least  66  2/3% of the  notes  to the
       modification  or elimination of certain  covenants;  and (iv)  regulatory
       approval and other customary closing conditions.

          the  acquisition,  if  consummated,  will be  accounted  for under the
       purchase method of accounting.  in connection with the  acquisition,  the
       company has  arranged for a new 42 month $650  million  revolving  credit
       facility   which  will  be  used:  (i)  to  refinance  the  secured  debt
       outstanding under the company's and hills'  existing  credit  facilities;
      (ii) to finance the purchase of the equity and the notes; (iii) to finance
       the  post-acquisition  remodeling  and pre-opening program for the hills'
       stores; and (iv) to provide for the ongoing working capital needs  of the
       company subsequent to the acquisition.

                                other information


item 1.        legal proceedings
               -----------------
                    reference  can  be  made  to  note  12 to  the  consolidated
               financial  statements  included in the company's most recent form
               10-k for various  litigation  involving  the  company,  for which
               there were no material  changes since the filing date of the form
               10-k, except as set forth in note 7 of this quarterly report.


item 4.        submission of matters to a vote of security holders
               ---------------------------------------------------
                    there  were  no  matters  submitted  to a vote  of  security
               holders during the third quarter ended october 31, 1998,  through
               the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.


item 5.        other information
               -----------------
                    any notice of a proposal submitted by a stockholder  outside
               of the  process of rule 14a-8  after  february  22,  1999 will be
               considered untimely.  therefore, the proxy solicited on behalf of
               the  company's  board  of  directors  will  confer  discretionary
               authority to vote on any such proposal properly coming before the
               1999 annual meeting.

                    stock  options  granted  to  many  of the  company's  senior
               executives pursuant to the 1994 management stock option plan will
               expire  in  march  1999.  as  previously  reported,  the  company
               anticipates  that in the normal  course of  business  some senior
               executives  may sell some shares of ames common  stock during the
               fourth  quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, in part to
               cover the cost of option  exercises  or for the  payment of taxes

1997. during fiscal 1998, six (6) stores were opened, two (2) stores were closed
and  one (1)  store  was  temporarily  closed  as a  result  of a  fire.  in the
comparable prior-year period, nine (9) stores were opened,  thirteen (13) stores
were  closed  and the  company  determined  that it would  not  re-open  a store
previously closed as a result of flooding.
