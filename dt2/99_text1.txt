notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)

1.the   accompanying   unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for interim financial  information  and  with
  the  instructions  to form 10-q and article 10  of  regulation  s-x.
  accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and
  footnotes  required by generally accepted accounting principles  for
  complete financial statements.  in the opinion of management,  these
  financial  statements contain all adjustments, consisting of  normal
  recurring  accruals,  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
  position,  results  of  operations and cash flows  for  the  periods
  indicated.   results of operations for the periods presented  herein
  are  not  necessarily indicative of results of  operations  for  the
  entire  year.   the  balance sheet at december  31,  1999  has  been
  derived  from  the audited financial statements at that  date.   the
  results  of  operations, cash flows and net assets for  sabre,  inc.
  (sabre),  amr  services,  amr combs and teleservice  resources  have
  been   reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial   statements   as
  discontinued  operations (see note 5 below),  including  restatement
  of  this information previously reported in the march 31, 1999  form
  10-q.   for further information, refer to the consolidated financial
  statements  and  footnotes thereto included in the  amr  corporation
  (amr  or the company) annual report on form 10-k for the year  ended
  december 31, 1999.

2.accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and property  at  march
  31,  2000  and december 31, 1999, was $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion,
  respectively.   accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital leases at march 31, 2000 and december 31,  1999,  was
  $1.3 billion.

3.as  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial  statements
  included  in the company's annual report on form 10-k for  the  year
  ended  december 31, 1999, the miami international airport  authority
  is  currently remediating various environmental conditions at  miami
  international  airport (airport) and funding the  remediation  costs
  through  landing  fee  revenues.  future costs  of  the  remediation
  effort  may be borne by carriers operating at the airport, including
  american  airlines,  inc. (american), a wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
  the  company,  through increased landing fees and/or other  charges.
  in  addition,  the  company is subject to  environmental  issues  at
  various   other  airport  and  non-airport  locations.    management
  believes,  after considering a number of factors, that the  ultimate
  disposition  of  these  environmental  issues  is  not  expected  to
  materially  affect  the company's consolidated  financial  position,
  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.   amounts  recorded   for
  environmental issues are based on the company's current  assessments
  of   the  ultimate  outcome  and,  accordingly,  could  increase  or
  decrease as these assessments change.

4.as of march 31, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the
  following  aircraft: 77 boeing 737-800s, 22 boeing  777-200igws,  83
  embraer  emb-135s and 25 bombardier crj-700s.  in addition,  in  may
  2000, the company announced its agreement to purchase 20 boeing 757-
  200  aircraft  and  retire  five mcdonnell douglas  md-90  aircraft.
  deliveries of all aircraft continue through 2006.  payments for  all
  aircraft will approximate $1.8 billion during the remainder of 2000,
  $2.3  billion  in  2001, $650 million in 2002 and  an  aggregate  of
  approximately $1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006.

5.during  the first quarter of 1999, the company completed  the  sales
  of  amr  services, amr combs and teleservice resources.  as a result
  of  these  sales,  the company recorded a gain of approximately  $64
  million, net of income taxes of approximately $19 million.

  effective  after  the  close of business  on  march  15,  2000,  amr
  distributed 0.722652 shares of sabre class a common stock  for  each
  share  of  amr stock owned by amr's shareholders.  the  record  date
  for  the dividend of sabre stock was the close of business on  march
  1,  2000.   in addition, on february 18, 2000, sabre paid a  special
  one-time cash dividend of $675 million to shareholders of record  of
  sabre  common stock at the close of business on february  15,  2000.
  based  upon  its  approximate  83 percent  interest  in  sabre,  amr
  received  approximately $559 million of this dividend.  these  funds
  will   be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including   the
  acquisition  of  aircraft.  the dividend of amr's  entire  ownership
  interest  in sabre's common stock resulted in a reduction  to  amr's
  retained  earnings in march of 2000 equal to the carrying  value  of
  the   company's  investment  in  sabre  on  march  15,  2000,  which
  approximated $581 million.  in addition, effective march  15,  2000,
  the  company reduced the exercise price and increased the number  of
  stock  options and awards by approximately 18 million to offset  the
  dilution  to  the holders, which occurred as a result of  the  spin-
  off.   these  changes  were made to keep the  holders  in  the  same
  economic position as before the spin-off.

  this  dilution adjustment was determined in accordance with emerging
  issues  task  force consensus no. 90-9, "changes to  fixed  employee
  stock  option  plans  as  a  result of  equity  restructuring,"  and
  accordingly, had no impact on earnings.

  the  results  of operations for sabre, amr services, amr  combs  and
  teleservice  resources  have  been  reflected  in  the  consolidated
  statements  of  operations  as  discontinued  operations.   the  net
  assets  of  sabre of approximately $1.0 billion were  classified  in
  the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 1999  in

item  2.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2000 and 1999

summary  amr's  income from continuing operations  during  the  first
quarter  of 2000 was $89 million, or $0.57 per common share  diluted,
as  compared  to $17 million, or $0.11 per common share diluted,  for
the  same  period  in 1999.  amr's operating income of  $212  million
increased  $166 million compared to the same period in  1999.   amr's
first  quarter  1999  results  include  a  labor  disagreement   that
disrupted  the  company's  operations  and  negatively  impacted  the
company's  1999 net earnings by an estimated $140 million,  or  $0.85
per  common  share  diluted, partially offset by an  approximate  $19
million after-tax gain, or $0.12 per common share diluted, related to
the  sale  of  a  portion  of  american's holdings  in  equant,  n.v.
(equant).

the  company's revenues increased $570 million, or 14.2  percent,  in
the  first  quarter  of  2000  versus  the  same  period  last  year.
american's  passenger  revenues increased by 13.6  percent,  or  $450
million.  american's yield (the average amount one passenger pays  to
fly one mile) of 13.95 cents increased by 6.2 percent compared to the
same period in 1999.  domestic yields increased 6.1 percent from  the
first  quarter of 1999.  international yields increased 7.0  percent,
primarily  due  to an increase of 22.6 percent, 6.7 percent  and  5.3
percent  in  pacific, europe and latin american yields, respectively.
the  increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong u.s. economy,
which  led  to  strong  demand for air  travel  and  a
favorable  pricing climate.  in addition, the first quarter  of  1999
includes   a   schedule  disruption  which  impacted  the   company's
operations.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  6.8
percent  to 27.0 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31,  2000,
due primarily to the labor disagreement in the first quarter of 1999.
american's  capacity or available seat miles (asms) of  40.0  billion
miles  increased 6.1 percent compared to the first quarter  of  1999.
american's  domestic  traffic  increased  5.4  percent  on   capacity
increases  of  5.1 percent and international traffic  increased  10.2
percent  on  capacity  growth  of  8.6  percent.   the  increase   in
international  traffic  was  driven by a  24.6  percent  increase  in
traffic  to  the pacific on capacity growth of 10.0 percent,  a  12.2
percent increase in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of  14.0
percent  and  a 6.4 percent increase in traffic to latin  america  on
capacity growth of 4.6 percent.

amr  eagle's  passenger  revenues  increased  $67  million,  or  24.7
percent,  due primarily to the acquisition of business express,  inc.
in march 1999.

cargo  revenues increased 15.2 percent, or $22 million, due primarily
to  the impact of the labor disagreement which impacted the company's
operations in the first quarter of 1999.

the  company's other revenues increased $31 million, or 11.4 percent,
primarily  as a result of higher employee travel service charges  and
increased administrative service charges and code-share revenues.

the  company's  operating expenses increased 10.2  percent,  or  $404
million.   american's  cost per asm increased  3.4  percent  to  9.96
cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased 10.2 percent, or  $150
million,  primarily  due  to an increase in  the  average  number  of
equivalent  employees, contractual wage rate and seniority  increases
that are built into the company's labor contracts and an increase  in
the   provision  for  profit-sharing  and  stock-based  compensation.
aircraft fuel expense increased 58.5 percent, or $204 million, due to
a  47.4 percent increase in american's average price per gallon and a
6.3 percent increase in american's fuel consumption.  the increase in
fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $122 million recognized
during  the  first  quarter of 2000 related  to  the  company's  fuel
hedging program.  depreciation and amortization expense increased $35
million,  or  13.8  percent,  due to the addition  of  new  aircraft.
commissions to agents decreased 10.8 percent, or $31 million, despite
an  increase  of approximately 14 percent in passenger revenues,  due
primarily  to  the  benefit  from the international  base  commission
structure  change implemented in october 1999 and a decrease  in  the
percentage  of  commissionable transactions.  food service  increased
10.8  percent,  or  $18  million, due primarily  to  an  increase  in
passengers boarded and rate increases.

                                     -7-
<page> 10
other  income (expense) increased $49 million due primarily to a  $26
million  increase in interest expense resulting from an  increase  in
long-term  debt,  partially offset by an increase of  $8  million  in
interest  income  as  a  result of higher  investment  balances.   in
addition, in march 1999, the company recognized a $31 million gain on
the sale of a portion of american's interest in equant.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash provided by operating activities in the three-month  period
ended  march  31, 2000 was $521 million, an increase of $369  million
over  the same period in 1999.  this increase resulted primarily from
an increase in the air traffic liability due to higher advanced sales
and  an  increase  in  income from continuing  operations,  partially
offset by an increase in accounts receivable as compared to the  same
period  in 1999.  capital expenditures for the first three months  of
2000  were $781 million, and included the acquisition of four  boeing
777-200igws,  four  boeing  737-800s, five  embraer  145s  and  three
embraer 135 aircraft.  these capital expenditures were financed  with
internally generated cash and the $559 million of cash received  from
the  sabre  dividend,  except for the embraer aircraft  acquisitions,
which were funded through secured debt agreements.

      as of march 31, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the
following  aircraft:  77  boeing 737-800s, 22 boeing  777-200igws,  83
embraer  emb-135s  and 25 bombardier crj-700s.  in  addition,  in  may
2000,  the company announced its agreement to purchase 20 boeing  757-
200  aircraft  and  retire  five  mcdonnell  douglas  md-90  aircraft.
deliveries  of all aircraft continue through 2006.  payments  for  all
aircraft  will approximate $1.8 billion during the remainder of  2000,
$2.3  billion  in  2001,  $650 million in 2002  and  an  aggregate  of
approximately $1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006.  the company  expects
to  fund  its  remaining 2000 capital expenditures from the  company's
existing  cash and short-term investments, internally generated  cash,
and  new  financing depending upon capital market conditions  and  the
company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas, and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three states (kansas, mississippi, and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997 amendment).

     in  october  1997,  the city of fort worth filed  suit  in  state
district  court  against  the city of dallas  and  others  seeking  to
enforce  the  bond  ordinance.   fort worth  contends  that  the  1997
amendment  does  not preclude the city of dallas from  exercising  its
proprietary  rights  to restrict traffic at love  field  in  a  manner
consistent with the bond ordinance and, moreover, that dallas  has  an
obligation to do so.  american joined in this litigation.  on  october
15,  1998, the state district court granted summary judgment in  favor
of  fort  worth and american, which summary judgment is being appealed
to  the  fort worth court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw  filed
claims  alleging  that irrespective of whether the bond  ordinance  is
enforceable,  the dfw use agreement prohibits american and  other  dfw
signatory  airlines  from  moving any interstate  operations  to  love
field.  these claims remain unresolved.

     dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division, seeking to have the court declare that, as a matter of  law,
the  1997  amendment precludes the city of dallas from exercising  any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental airlines and continental express filed a lawsuit in dallas
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using regional jets.  these  two  federal  court
lawsuits were consolidated and stayed.

                                     -9-
<page> 12
     in  december 1998, the department of transportation (dot)  issued
an  order  on the federal law questions concerning the bond ordinance,
local  proprietary powers, dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers  such
as  american,  and the wright and 1997 amendments, and concluded  that
the  bond ordinance was preempted by federal law and was therefore not
enforceable.   the dot also found that the dfw use agreement  did  not
preclude american from conducting interstate operations at love field.
fort  worth,  american and dfw appealed the dot's order to  the  fifth
circuit  court of appeals, and on february 1, 2000, the fifth  circuit
affirmed  the  dot's order in all respects.  on march  3,  2000,  fort
worth  filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united  states
supreme court asking the court to review the fifth circuit's decision.
on  may  1,  2000,  american similarly filed a petition  for  writ  of
certiorari  with the united states supreme court asking the  court  to
review  the fifth circuit's decision to the extent it found  that  the
bond  ordinance's restrictions on service at love field are preempted.
on  may  1,  2000,  dfw also filed a petition for writ  of  certiorari
asking  the  supreme court to review the portion of the fifth  circuit
decision  that found that the dfw use agreement was preempted  to  the
extent  that  it  precludes  dfw  signatory  carriers  from  operating
interstate service at love field.

     in  january 2000, the department of justice, at the behest of the
dot,  filed  a  lawsuit in the united states district  court  for  the
northern  district of texas, dallas division, against fort  worth  and
american  seeking to enforce the dot's order and to prevent any  party
from  interfering with any carrier operating under  that  order.   dot
subsequently  filed a motion for summary judgement which american  and
fort worth are opposing.

     on may 1, 2000 american commenced new service from love field to
chicago  and los angeles using space leased from continental  express
through  may 28, 2000.  american is seeking facilities at love  field
from the city of dallas to use for this new service starting may  29,
2000.   as a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
and/or the inability of american to effectively compete at love field
could adversely impact american's business.

part ii:  other information

item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
several  purported class action cases currently pending in the circuit
court  of  cook  county,  illinois.  in  wolens  et  al.  v.  american
airlines,  inc.  and  tucker  v. american airlines,  inc.  (hereafter,
"wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and attorneys' fees  claiming
that a change made to american's aadvantage program in may 1988, which
limited  the  number of seats available to participants travelling  on
certain  awards,  breached american's agreement  with  its  aadvantage
members.   (although the wolens complaint originally asserted  several
state  law  claims,  only  the plaintiffs' breach  of  contract  claim
remains   after  the  u.s.  supreme  court  ruled  that  the   airline
deregulation act preempted the other claims).  in gutterman et al.  v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs also seek
money  damages  and  attorneys' fees claiming that the  february  1995
increase  in the award mileage required to claim a certain  aadvantage
travel   award  breached  the  agreement  between  american  and   its
aadvantage  members.   on  june  23, 1998,  the  court  certified  the
gutterman case as a class action, although to date no notice has  been
sent to the class.

    in february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs
reached  a  settlement of both lawsuits.  pursuant to  the  agreement,
american and the plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the
wolens  and  gutterman lawsuits for purposes of settlement.   further,
american and the wolens plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to  certify
a  wolens  class  of  aadvantage  members  who  had  at  least  35,000
unredeemed  aadvantage miles as of december 31,  1988.   in  addition,
american  and  the  gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask  the  court  to
decertify  the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman
class  of  aadvantage  members who as of december  31,  1993  (a)  had
redeemed  25,000  or  50,000 aadvantage miles for  certain  aadvantage
awards  and/or (b) had at least 4,700 unredeemed new miles in  his  or
her  account that were earned before january 1, 1992.  depending  upon
certain  factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be  entitled
to   receive  certificates  entitling  them  to  mileage  off  certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

    as  part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens  and
gutterman  plaintiffs'  attorneys and the cost  of  administering  the
settlement,  which amounts were accrued as of december 31,  1999.   in
consideration for the relief provided for in the settlement agreement,
wolens  and  gutterman class members will release  american  from  all
claims  arising  from  any  changes that  american  has  made  to  the
aadvantage program and reaffirming american's right to make changes to
the  aadvantage  program in the future.  on may  2,  2000,  the  court
preliminarily approved the settlement and authorized sending notice of
the  settlement  to class members.  before the settlement  can  become
effective,  the  court  must  give final approval  of  the  settlement
agreement after providing any objectors an opportunity to be heard.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998, continental,  delta,  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
on  march 30, 2000, the texas court of appeals in austin affirmed the
granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment.

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against the
allied  pilots association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo  shippers adversely affected by a labor disagreement  that
disrupted operations in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american independently  liable.
instead,  plaintiffs named american as a defendant  because  american
has a $45.5 million judgment against the apa.  apa filed cross claims
against american alleging that american must indemnify pilots who put
themselves on the sick list.  apa also filed a motion to dismiss  all
claims  against  it.   a  united  states  district  court  magistrate
recommended  that the court dismiss all the claims  in  the  lawsuit,
concluding that certain claims are preempted by federal law and  that
certain  other claims should be brought in state court,  rather  than
federal  court.  the magistrate's recommendations are pending  before
the court.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

    on  july  26,  1999, a class action lawsuit  was  filed,  and  in
november   1999   an  amended  complaint  was  filed,   against   amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc. in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district  of
california,  western  division (westways world travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp.,  et al.).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel  agencies
to  pay  debit  memos to american for violations of  american's  fare
rules (by customers of the agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting
agreement   between  american  and  american  eagle  and  plaintiffs,
(2)  constitutes  unjust enrichment, and (3) violates  the  racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico).  the as  yet
uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or  will
be  required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules
violations  from  july 26, 1995 to the present.  plaintiffs  seek  to
enjoin  american from enforcing the pricing rules in question and  to
recover  the  amounts  paid  for debit memos,  plus  treble  damages,
attorneys' fees, and costs.  defendants' motion to dismiss all claims
is pending.  american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

   on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of   the  department  of  justice)  sued  amr  corporation,  american
airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in
wichita,   kansas.  the  lawsuit  alleges  that  american  unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by increasing
service  when  new competitors began flying to dfw, and  by  matching
these  new  competitors' fares. the department of  justice  seeks  to
enjoin american from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and  to
impose  restraints on american to remedy the alleged effects  of  its
past conduct.  american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

   between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began  flying  to dfw, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
two  of  the  suits  (smith  and wright) also  allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from dfw by offering discounted fares  to  corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions  on  the  use and availability of certain  fares,  and  by
offering override commissions to travel agents. the suits propose  to
certify  several classes of consumers, the broadest of which  is  all
persons who purchased tickets for air travel on american into or  out
of dfw since 1995 to the present.  on november 10, 1999, the district
court  stayed all of these actions pending developments in  the  case
brought by the department of justice.  as a result, to date no  class
has  been  certified.   american intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits
vigorously.

    on  march 1, 2000, american was served with a federal grand  jury
subpoena  calling for american to produce documents relating  to  de-
icing  operations at dfw since 1992.  american is not  able  at  this
time  to  determine  either  the  full  scope  of  the  grand  jury's
investigation  or  american's  role in the  investigation.   american
intends to fully cooperate with the government's investigation.

item  2.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2000 and 1999

summary  amr's  income from continuing operations  during  the  first
quarter  of 2000 was $89 million, or $0.57 per common share  diluted,
as  compared  to $17 million, or $0.11 per common share diluted,  for
the  same  period  in 1999.  amr's operating income of  $212  million
increased  $166 million compared to the same period in  1999.   amr's
first  quarter  1999  results  include  a  labor  disagreement   that
disrupted  the  company's  operations  and  negatively  impacted  the
company's  1999 net earnings by an estimated $140 million,  or  $0.85
per  common  share  diluted, partially offset by an  approximate  $19
million after-tax gain, or $0.12 per common share diluted, related to
the  sale  of  a  portion  of  american's holdings  in  equant,  n.v.
(equant).

the  company's revenues increased $570 million, or 14.2  percent,  in
the  first  quarter  of  2000  versus  the  same  period  last  year.
american's  passenger  revenues increased by 13.6  percent,  or  $450
million.  american's yield (the average amount one passenger pays  to
fly one mile) of 13.95 cents increased by 6.2 percent compared to the
same period in 1999.  domestic yields increased 6.1 percent from  the
first  quarter of 1999.  international yields increased 7.0  percent,
primarily  due  to an increase of 22.6 percent, 6.7 percent  and  5.3
percent  in  pacific, europe and latin american yields, respectively.
the  increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong u.s. economy,
which  led  to  strong  demand for air  travel  and  a
favorable  pricing climate.  in addition, the first quarter  of  1999
includes   a   schedule  disruption  which  impacted  the   company's
operations.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  6.8
percent  to 27.0 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31,  2000,
due primarily to the labor disagreement in the first quarter of 1999.
american's  capacity or available seat miles (asms) of  40.0  billion
miles  increased 6.1 percent compared to the first quarter  of  1999.
american's  domestic  traffic  increased  5.4  percent  on   capacity
increases  of  5.1 percent and international traffic  increased  10.2
percent  on  capacity  growth  of  8.6  percent.   the  increase   in
international  traffic  was  driven by a  24.6  percent  increase  in
traffic  to  the pacific on capacity growth of 10.0 percent,  a  12.2
percent increase in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of  14.0
percent  and  a 6.4 percent increase in traffic to latin  america  on
capacity growth of 4.6 percent.

amr  eagle's  passenger  revenues  increased  $67  million,  or  24.7
percent,  due primarily to the acquisition of business express,  inc.
in march 1999.

cargo  revenues increased 15.2 percent, or $22 million, due primarily
to  the impact of the labor disagreement which impacted the company's
operations in the first quarter of 1999.

the  company's other revenues increased $31 million, or 11.4 percent,
primarily  as a result of higher employee travel service charges  and
increased administrative service charges and code-share revenues.

the  company's  operating expenses increased 10.2  percent,  or  $404
million.   american's  cost per asm increased  3.4  percent  to  9.96
cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased 10.2 percent, or  $150
million,  primarily  due  to an increase in  the  average  number  of
equivalent  employees, contractual wage rate and seniority  increases
that are built into the company's labor contracts and an increase  in
the   provision  for  profit-sharing  and  stock-based  compensation.
aircraft fuel expense increased 58.5 percent, or $204 million, due to
a  47.4 percent increase in american's average price per gallon and a
6.3 percent increase in american's fuel consumption.  the increase in
fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $122 million recognized
during  the  first  quarter of 2000 related  to  the  company's  fuel
hedging program.  depreciation and amortization expense increased $35
million,  or  13.8  percent,  due to the addition  of  new  aircraft.
commissions to agents decreased 10.8 percent, or $31 million, despite
an  increase  of approximately 14 percent in passenger revenues,  due
primarily  to  the  benefit  from the international  base  commission
structure  change implemented in october 1999 and a decrease  in  the
percentage  of  commissionable transactions.  food service  increased
10.8  percent,  or  $18  million, due primarily  to  an  increase  in
passengers boarded and rate increases.

                                     -7-
<page> 10
other  income (expense) increased $49 million due primarily to a  $26
million  increase in interest expense resulting from an  increase  in
long-term  debt,  partially offset by an increase of  $8  million  in
interest  income  as  a  result of higher  investment  balances.   in
addition, in march 1999, the company recognized a $31 million gain on
the sale of a portion of american's interest in equant.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash provided by operating activities in the three-month  period
ended  march  31, 2000 was $521 million, an increase of $369  million
over  the same period in 1999.  this increase resulted primarily from
an increase in the air traffic liability due to higher advanced sales
and  an  increase  in  income from continuing  operations,  partially
offset by an increase in accounts receivable as compared to the  same
period  in 1999.  capital expenditures for the first three months  of
2000  were $781 million, and included the acquisition of four  boeing
777-200igws,  four  boeing  737-800s, five  embraer  145s  and  three
embraer 135 aircraft.  these capital expenditures were financed  with
internally generated cash and the $559 million of cash received  from
the  sabre  dividend,  except for the embraer aircraft  acquisitions,
which were funded through secured debt agreements.

      as of march 31, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the
following  aircraft:  77  boeing 737-800s, 22 boeing  777-200igws,  83
embraer  emb-135s  and 25 bombardier crj-700s.  in  addition,  in  may
2000,  the company announced its agreement to purchase 20 boeing  757-
200  aircraft  and  retire  five  mcdonnell  douglas  md-90  aircraft.
deliveries  of all aircraft continue through 2006.  payments  for  all
aircraft  will approximate $1.8 billion during the remainder of  2000,
$2.3  billion  in  2001,  $650 million in 2002  and  an  aggregate  of
approximately $1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006.  the company  expects
to  fund  its  remaining 2000 capital expenditures from the  company's
existing  cash and short-term investments, internally generated  cash,
and  new  financing depending upon capital market conditions  and  the
company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas, and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three states (kansas, mississippi, and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997 amendment).

     in  october  1997,  the city of fort worth filed  suit  in  state
district  court  against  the city of dallas  and  others  seeking  to
enforce  the  bond  ordinance.   fort worth  contends  that  the  1997
amendment  does  not preclude the city of dallas from  exercising  its
proprietary  rights  to restrict traffic at love  field  in  a  manner
consistent with the bond ordinance and, moreover, that dallas  has  an
obligation to do so.  american joined in this litigation.  on  october
15,  1998, the state district court granted summary judgment in  favor
of  fort  worth and american, which summary judgment is being appealed
to  the  fort worth court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw  filed
claims  alleging  that irrespective of whether the bond  ordinance  is
enforceable,  the dfw use agreement prohibits american and  other  dfw
signatory  airlines  from  moving any interstate  operations  to  love
field.  these claims remain unresolved.

     dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division, seeking to have the court declare that, as a matter of  law,
the  1997  amendment precludes the city of dallas from exercising  any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental airlines and continental express filed a lawsuit in dallas
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using regional jets.  these  two  federal  court
lawsuits were consolidated and stayed.

     in  december 1998, the department of transportation (dot)  issued
an  order  on the federal law questions concerning the bond ordinance,
local  proprietary powers, dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers  such
as  american,  and the wright and 1997 amendments, and concluded  that
the  bond ordinance was preempted by federal law and was therefore not
enforceable.   the dot also found that the dfw use agreement  did  not
preclude american from conducting interstate operations at love field.
fort  worth,  american and dfw appealed the dot's order to  the  fifth
circuit  court of appeals, and on february 1, 2000, the fifth  circuit
affirmed  the  dot's order in all respects.  on march  3,  2000,  fort
worth  filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united  states
supreme court asking the court to review the fifth circuit's decision.
on  may  1,  2000,  american similarly filed a petition  for  writ  of
certiorari  with the united states supreme court asking the  court  to
review  the fifth circuit's decision to the extent it found  that  the
bond  ordinance's restrictions on service at love field are preempted.
on  may  1,  2000,  dfw also filed a petition for writ  of  certiorari
asking  the  supreme court to review the portion of the fifth  circuit
decision  that found that the dfw use agreement was preempted  to  the
extent  that  it  precludes  dfw  signatory  carriers  from  operating
interstate service at love field.

     in  january 2000, the department of justice, at the behest of the
dot,  filed  a  lawsuit in the united states district  court  for  the
northern  district of texas, dallas division, against fort  worth  and
american  seeking to enforce the dot's order and to prevent any  party
from  interfering with any carrier operating under  that  order.   dot
subsequently  filed a motion for summary judgement which american  and
fort worth are opposing.

     on may 1, 2000 american commenced new service from love field to
chicago  and los angeles using space leased from continental  express
through  may 28, 2000.  american is seeking facilities at love  field
from the city of dallas to use for this new service starting may  29,
2000.   as a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
and/or the inability of american to effectively compete at love field
could adversely impact american's business.

part ii:  other information

item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
several  purported class action cases currently pending in the circuit
court  of  cook  county,  illinois.  in  wolens  et  al.  v.  american
airlines,  inc.  and  tucker  v. american airlines,  inc.  (hereafter,
"wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and attorneys' fees  claiming
that a change made to american's aadvantage program in may 1988, which
limited  the  number of seats available to participants travelling  on
certain  awards,  breached american's agreement  with  its  aadvantage
members.   (although the wolens complaint originally asserted  several
state  law  claims,  only  the plaintiffs' breach  of  contract  claim
remains   after  the  u.s.  supreme  court  ruled  that  the   airline
deregulation act preempted the other claims).  in gutterman et al.  v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs also seek
money  damages  and  attorneys' fees claiming that the  february  1995
increase  in the award mileage required to claim a certain  aadvantage
travel   award  breached  the  agreement  between  american  and   its
aadvantage  members.   on  june  23, 1998,  the  court  certified  the
gutterman case as a class action, although to date no notice has  been
sent to the class.

    in february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs
reached  a  settlement of both lawsuits.  pursuant to  the  agreement,
american and the plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the
wolens  and  gutterman lawsuits for purposes of settlement.   further,
american and the wolens plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to  certify
a  wolens  class  of  aadvantage  members  who  had  at  least  35,000
unredeemed  aadvantage miles as of december 31,  1988.   in  addition,
american  and  the  gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask  the  court  to
decertify  the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman
class  of  aadvantage  members who as of december  31,  1993  (a)  had
redeemed  25,000  or  50,000 aadvantage miles for  certain  aadvantage
awards  and/or (b) had at least 4,700 unredeemed new miles in  his  or
her  account that were earned before january 1, 1992.  depending  upon
certain  factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be  entitled
to   receive  certificates  entitling  them  to  mileage  off  certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

    as  part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens  and
gutterman  plaintiffs'  attorneys and the cost  of  administering  the
settlement,  which amounts were accrued as of december 31,  1999.   in
consideration for the relief provided for in the settlement agreement,
wolens  and  gutterman class members will release  american  from  all
claims  arising  from  any  changes that  american  has  made  to  the
aadvantage program and reaffirming american's right to make changes to
the  aadvantage  program in the future.  on may  2,  2000,  the  court
preliminarily approved the settlement and authorized sending notice of
the  settlement  to class members.  before the settlement  can  become
effective,  the  court  must  give final approval  of  the  settlement
agreement after providing any objectors an opportunity to be heard.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998, continental,  delta,  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
on  march 30, 2000, the texas court of appeals in austin affirmed the
granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment.

                                part ii

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against the
allied  pilots association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo  shippers adversely affected by a labor disagreement  that
disrupted operations in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american independently  liable.
instead,  plaintiffs named american as a defendant  because  american
has a $45.5 million judgment against the apa.  apa filed cross claims
against american alleging that american must indemnify pilots who put
themselves on the sick list.  apa also filed a motion to dismiss  all
claims  against  it.   a  united  states  district  court  magistrate
recommended  that the court dismiss all the claims  in  the  lawsuit,
concluding that certain claims are preempted by federal law and  that
certain  other claims should be brought in state court,  rather  than
federal  court.  the magistrate's recommendations are pending  before
the court.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

    on  july  26,  1999, a class action lawsuit  was  filed,  and  in
november   1999   an  amended  complaint  was  filed,   against   amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc. in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district  of
california,  western  division (westways world travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp.,  et al.).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel  agencies
to  pay  debit  memos to american for violations of  american's  fare
rules (by customers of the agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting
agreement   between  american  and  american  eagle  and  plaintiffs,
(2)  constitutes  unjust enrichment, and (3) violates  the  racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico).  the as  yet
uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or  will
be  required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules
violations  from  july 26, 1995 to the present.  plaintiffs  seek  to
enjoin  american from enforcing the pricing rules in question and  to
recover  the  amounts  paid  for debit memos,  plus  treble  damages,
attorneys' fees, and costs.  defendants' motion to dismiss all claims
is pending.  american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

   on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of   the  department  of  justice)  sued  amr  corporation,  american
airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in
wichita,   kansas.  the  lawsuit  alleges  that  american  unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by increasing
service  when  new competitors began flying to dfw, and  by  matching
these  new  competitors' fares. the department of  justice  seeks  to
enjoin american from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and  to
impose  restraints on american to remedy the alleged effects  of  its
past conduct.  american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

   between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began  flying  to dfw, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
two  of  the  suits  (smith  and wright) also  allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from dfw by offering discounted fares  to  corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions  on  the  use and availability of certain  fares,  and  by
offering override commissions to travel agents. the suits propose  to
certify  several classes of consumers, the broadest of which  is  all
persons who purchased tickets for air travel on american into or  out
of dfw since 1995 to the present.  on november 10, 1999, the district
court  stayed all of these actions pending developments in  the  case
brought by the department of justice.  as a result, to date no  class
has  been  certified.   american intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits
vigorously.

    on  march 1, 2000, american was served with a federal grand  jury
subpoena  calling for american to produce documents relating  to  de-
icing  operations at dfw since 1992.  american is not  able  at  this
time  to  determine  either  the  full  scope  of  the  grand  jury's
investigation  or  american's  role in the  investigation.   american
intends to fully cooperate with the government's investigation.
