of operations.
 
overview
 
     ames changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to the
saturday nearest january 31, effective with the fiscal year ended january 30,
1999, which we refer to as "fiscal 1998." we made this change so that our fiscal
year would coincide with the fiscal year of most other publicly-held retailers.
fiscal 1998 consisted of 52 weeks. our fiscal year ended january 31, 1998, which
we refer to as "fiscal 1997," consisted of 53 weeks. our fiscal year ended
january 25, 1997, which we refer to as "fiscal 1996," consisted of 52 weeks.
 
     you should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in
this annual report.
 
results of operations
 
fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997
 
     on december 31, 1998, we acquired approximately 81.3% of the outstanding
voting stock of hills stores company. accordingly, the operations of hills and
its subsidiaries during the month of january 1999 are included in our
<page>

consolidated results of operations for fiscal 1998. immediately following our
acquisition of hills, we began implementing a series of initiatives to prepare
for the conversion of 150 of the hills stores into ames stores and the permanent
closure of the five remaining hills stores. these initiatives included the
termination of most of hills' corporate and administrative operations and
personnel, the announced closure of seven ames stores that we considered to be
directly competitive with acquired hills stores and the engagement of two
experienced liquidation firms, gordon brothers retail partners and the nassi
group, to operate the hills stores until their closure and to liquidate hills'
merchandise inventories.
 
     under our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group, we are
entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales, as a minimum
guaranteed amount, 40% of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory
being sold, irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold. the remaining
sale proceeds, net of the expenses of operating the stores, are payable to the
liquidators as compensation for their services, subject to additional
allocations to ames to the extent the proceeds exceed specified targets. for
financial reporting purposes, hills' net sales during the month of january
represent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales, its cost
of merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that ames is
entitled to retain, and its selling, general and administrative expenses include
the portion of those proceeds that are to be paid over to the liquidators.
 
     because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with gordon
brothers and the nassi group, as well as the fact that 50 hills stores were in
the process of liquidation, hills' results for the month of january 1999 are not
representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of
business and are not directly comparable to ames' results exclusive of hills.
the acquisition of hills also resulted in various costs and charges during the
month of january 1999 that impacted ames' consolidated results. these other
costs and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminating
contracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of hills, the write-off of
deferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility, interest expense
for borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one-time charge for the
announced closing of the seven ames stores. the following table illustrates the
separate contribution of ames' full year of operations and hills' one month of
operations to various components of the consolidated results of operations for
fiscal 1998, as well as the impact on these consolidated results of the other
costs and charges described above:

     the unique circumstances under which hills' operations have been conducted
since december 31, 1998 and the accounting treatment accorded those operations
as a consequence of our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group
distort any direct comparison of the principal components of ames' consolidated
results for fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997. accordingly, in the discussion that
follows, ames' net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative
expense, and its leased department and other income for fiscal 1998 are
presented and compared exclusive of the hills results. the impact of the hills
acquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortization
expense and interest and debt expense.

     ames' net sales (which exclude sales from leased shoe departments)
increased 7.3%, to $2.40 billion in fiscal 1998 from $2.23 billion in fiscal
1997, due primarily to 7.2% growth in same-store sales. ames experienced
particularly strong improvements in sales of domestics, toys, ready-to-assemble
furniture and women's sportswear. in comparing results for the two fiscal years,
you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal 1997 were favorably affected by
the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores that
were closed in the beginning of fiscal 1998 and by the fact that fiscal 1997
included one additional week of operations.
 
                                       14
<page>
     ames' gross margin increased $45.7 million in fiscal 1998 compared to
fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at 28.2%. the
gross margin rate in fiscal 1998 benefitted from a higher average markup on
sales, which was partially offset by higher markdowns.
 
     ames' selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.3 million
in fiscal 1998, but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 26.0% in fiscal
1997 to 25.3% in fiscal 1998. the percentage decrease was primarily attributable
to a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense, partially
offset by an increase in health and medical costs.
 
     ames' leased department and other income increased $4.1 million, or 16.3%,
in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. the increase was due primarily to the
leased shoe department, layaway and vending income, as well as the receipt of
funds previously held in a trust.
 
     ames' depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.6 million, or
69.1%, in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. the increase related primarily to
new point-of-sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certain
capital leases. the hills acquisition added a further $3.2 million of
depreciation and amortization expense associated with the additional
depreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rights
and the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the hills acquisition
cost over the value of the acquired assets. we are amortizing the beneficial
lease rights using the straight-line method over the terms of the related leases
(which average approximately 25 years) and are amortizing the hills goodwill
over 25 years on a straight-line basis. the amortization of the excess of our
revalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in
fiscal 1998 as in fiscal 1997. we are amortizing this amount over a ten-year
period that will conclude in january 2003.
 
     the hills acquisition resulted in a 31.5%, or $3.7 million, increase in
consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, in fiscal 1998. debt and
capital lease obligations of hills accounted for $1.9 million of the increase.
another $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to the non-cash write-off
of deferred financing costs under ames' prior credit facility. the balance was
attributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance the costs
of the acquisition.
 
     in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, we recorded charges of $8.2 million
in connection with the announced closing of seven ames stores that are scheduled
to close in fiscal 1999. principal components of these charges are for lease
costs and the write-down of fixed assets. we have also planned for the closing
of five of the acquired hills stores and, pursuant to the purchase method of
accounting, have provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired
hills assets. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of
$1.6 million in connection with the closing of two stores, of which
$1.0 million was classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was
recorded as part of the cost of merchandise sold.
 
     we recorded an income tax provision of $18.8 million in fiscal 1998, of
which approximately $0.5 million will be paid in cash. in fiscal 1997, we
recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million, of which approximately
$0.3 million was paid in cash. see note 10 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements for an explanation of fresh-start reporting and sfas
no. 109.
 
fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996
 
     we reported improvements in sales and net earnings for fiscal 1997 over
fiscal 1996. the improvements were due to the favorable impact of our opening 21
new stores in the preceding two fiscal years, our closing of 12 underperforming
stores at the beginning of fiscal 1997 and the continued improvement in our
gross margin rate.

     net sales increased 3.3%, from $2.16 billion in fiscal 1996 to
$2.23 billion in fiscal 1997, due to an increase of 2.1% in same-store sales,
the inclusion of 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 1997 and the opening of new
stores.
 
     gross margin increased $33.5 million, or 0.6% as a percentage of net sales,
in fiscal 1997. the gross margin rate was favorably impacted by a slightly
higher average markup on sales and a reduction in markdowns. these factors were
partially offset by higher volume of "55 gold(registered) savings" senior
citizen markdowns in fiscal 1997. cost of merchandise sold in fiscal 1997
included a $0.6 million charge for inventory write-downs associated with two
stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1998. cost of merchandise sold
in fiscal 1996 included a $2.8 million charge for inventory write-downs
associated with 13 stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1997.
 
     selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.3 million in
fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales compared to
fiscal 1996. the increase was primarily attributable to higher payroll expenses,
a substantial portion of which was related to the inclusion of an additional
week of operations and to federal minimum wage increases. insurance expense
increased due to a greater loss experience in fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal
1996.
 
     leased department and other income declined $0.7 million (or 2.7%) in
fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996, due primarily to a decline in sales at
leased shoe departments.
 
     depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.0 million, or 0.1% as
a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. depreciation and amortization expense
included impairment losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 1997 and $2.2 million in
fiscal 1996 that were recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas no. 121 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1995. depreciation and amortization also included
depreciation on capital additions subsequent to december 26, 1992, the date on
which we wrote off all of our non-current assets in connection with the adoption
of fresh-start reporting. the amortization of the excess of revalued net assets
over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in fiscal 1997 as in
fiscal 1996. we are amortizing this amount over a ten-year period.
 
     interest and debt expense, net of interest income, declined $7.4 million,
or 0.4% as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. the reduction was
primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of deferred financing costs, a
reduction in short-term interest expense and the favorable impact of lower
outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances. the decrease in
short-term interest expense reflected a decrease in short-term borrowings
(weighted average of $66.5 million in fiscal 1997 compared to $86.1 million in
fiscal 1996) and a decrease in interest rates under our revolving credit
facility. our average outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances
decreased to $41.3 million in fiscal 1997 from $56.3 million in fiscal 1996.

     during fiscal 1997, we realized proceeds of $1.9 million from the sale of
our rights under a lease, which resulted in a deferred gain of $1.7 million to
be recognized over a 20-year period. during fiscal 1996, we sold our rights
under several leases for a total of $0.7 million in proceeds and recognized
gains totaling $0.4 million.
 
     in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of $1.6 million
in connection with the closing of two stores, of which $1.0 million was
classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was classified as part of
the cost of merchandise sold. both of the stores closed in february 1998. in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, we recorded charges of $9.7 million in connection
with the closing of 13 stores. the $9.7 million is classified in two line items:
$6.9 million as a store closing charge and $2.8 million as part of cost of
merchandise sold.
 
     we recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million in fiscal 1997, of
which approximately $0.3 million was paid in cash. in fiscal 1996, we recorded a
non-cash income tax provision of $8.1 million.
 
     as a result of our termination of a revolving credit facility in december
1996, we recorded in fiscal 1996 a non-cash extraordinary charge of
$1.4 million, net of tax benefit of $0.6 million. the tax benefit was recorded
as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. the charge was for the write-off
of the deferred financing costs related to the facility.
 
liquidity and capital resources
 
     our principal sources of liquidity are our bank credit facility, cash from
operations and cash on hand. our current bank credit facility consists of a
revolving credit facility of up to $650.0 million, with a sublimit of
$150.0 million for letters of credit, which expires june 30, 2002. borrowings
under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets
and we are required to meet certain financial covenants after february 2000. in
addition, we are required to maintain a minimum availability of at least
$100.0 million. our peak borrowing level in fiscal 1998 under this bank credit
facility and a predecessor facility was $148.3 million. we believe we will have
sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable
future.
 
     our cash position decreased by $22.1 million during fiscal 1998. the
decrease was due primarily to $103.9 million paid out in the acquisition of
hills (net of cash acquired), $51.6 million of capital expenditures and
$16.3 million in debt and capital lease payments, partially offset by
$111.6 million in cash from operations and $44.9 million of borrowings under our
bank credit facility. our cash position increased by $11.7 million during fiscal
1997. this increase was primarily due to $56.8 million of cash from operations,
partially offset by $32.9 million of capital expenditures and $15.7 million of
debt and capital lease payments.
 
     merchandise inventories increased by $197.7 million in fiscal 1998 due to
planned increases and the inclusion of $169.1 million of merchandise inventories
of hills. the hills inventories have been valued at approximately 40% of the
initial ticketed retail price of the merchandise, which represents the minimum
amount we are entitled to retain out of the proceeds from the liquidation of the
merchandise. our merchandise inventories increased by $32.8 million in fiscal
1997 as a result of planned increases as well as early receipts of additional
merchandise for our 40th anniversary promotion held in march 1998. we use the
first-in, first-out (fifo) method of accounting for inventories.
 
     net fixed assets increased by $288.3 million during fiscal 1998 due to the
inclusion of $230.9 million in net fixed assets of hills and $77.5 million of
capital expenditures, including $25.9 million in new point-of-sale information
equipment and related software acquired under capital leases. the hills net
fixed assets were adjusted to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition
date. in fiscal 1997, our net fixed assets increased by $19.7 million.
 
     beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value of
the acquired hills leases over contract value of those leases. we are amortizing
this amount over the terms of the related leases (which average approximately
25 years) using the straight-line method. goodwill is being amortized over
25 years using the straight-line method.
 
     accounts payable increased $173.6 million during fiscal 1998 due to
improved payment terms and the inclusion of hills accounts payable of $127.8
million as of january 30, 1999. accounts payable increased $34.2 million during
fiscal 1997 due to improved payment terms and an increase in merchandise
receipts in january 1998 over january 1997.
 
                                       17
<page>
     long-term debt as of january 30, 1999 consisted of borrowings under our
bank credit facility of $44.9 million and $50.9 million of hills senior notes
that remained outstanding after the acquisition.
 
     capital lease and financing obligations increased by $165.5 million during
fiscal 1998 due to the inclusion of $147.9 million of capital lease and
financing obligations of hills and $25.9 million of new capital leases.
 
     we have not paid any cash dividends during the past three fiscal years. the
payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our bank credit
facility.
 
capital expenditures
 
     capital expenditures for fiscal 1998 were $77.5 million, including
$25.9 million in new point-of-sale information equipment and related software
acquired pursuant to capital leases. the capital expenditure amount also
included, among other items, the opening of six new stores, the remodeling of 22
stores and the upgrading of certain management information systems. capital
expenditures for fiscal 1997 were $32.9 million and included, among other items,
the opening of nine new stores, the remodeling of nine stores and the upgrading
of certain management information systems, including the installation of new
point-of-sale systems in ten stores.
 
     capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $210.0 million for
fiscal 1999, primarily for the remodeling and conversion of 150 of the acquired
hills stores and nine former caldor stores. we expect to finance conversion
expenditures, including but not limited to, distribution center equipment
purchases, store fixtures and equipment and remodeling expenses, through
internally generated funds and borrowings under our bank credit facility. we
expect to finance a substantial portion of new point-of-sale systems through
capital leases. land, buildings and improvements are financed principally
through long-term leases.
 
seasonality
 
     our business is seasonal in nature, with a large portion of our net sales
occurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the
back-to-school and christmas shopping seasons. net sales are highest in the last
fiscal quarter (31.7% in fiscal 1998). the demand for working capital is
heaviest in may, and from august through november, when sufficient merchandise
must be purchased for the spring, back-to-school and christmas seasons,
respectively.
 
year 2000 readiness
 
     in operating our business, we are dependent on information technology and
process control systems that employ computers as well as embedded
microprocessors. we also depend on the proper functioning of the business
systems of third parties, particularly the more than 3,200 vendors from whom we
purchase the merchandise sold in our stores. many computer systems and
microprocessors can only process dates in which the year is represented by two
digits. as a result, some of these systems and processors may interpret "00"
incorrectly as the year 1900 instead of the year 2000, in which event they could
malfunction or become inoperable after december 31, 1999. systems and processors
that can properly recognize the year 2000 are referred to as "year 2000
compliant."
 
     as previously reported, we initiated a comprehensive program to prepare our
computer systems and applications for the year 2000. we have spent approximately
$3.8 million on this program through the end of fiscal 1998 and expect that full
implementation of the program will involve an additional $2.0 million to
$2.5 million, including expenditures for software and consulting services.
additionally, we estimate the allocated costs of our internal system development
staff who are implementing our year 2000 initiatives to be $3.5 million to
$4.0 million over the life of the project.

forward-looking statements
 
     the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and
elsewhere in this annual report that are not historical facts are
"forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. those statements include all discussions of
strategy as well as statements that contain such forward-looking expressions as
"believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "will," "should," or
"anticipates" or the negative thereof. in addition, from time to time, we or our
representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in
writing. furthermore, forward-looking statements may be included in our filings
with the securities and exchange commission as well as in press releases or oral
presentations made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive
officers.
 
     we caution you to bear in mind that forward-looking statements, by their
very nature, involve assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and
uncertainties. although we believe that the assumptions and expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, no
assurance can be given that those assumptions or expectations will prove to have
been correct. important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
     o deteriorating general economic conditions in the united states,
       particularly in the regions in which our stores are located;
 
     o decreased consumer spending, particularly among those consumers who
       comprise our primary customer base;
 
     o increased competition from other discount retailers, including major
       national chains, as well as from merchandise offerings on the internet;
 
     o severe adverse weather conditions during the winter months, particularly
       during the peak christmas holiday shopping season; and
 
     o failure of our suppliers to make their computer systems year 2000
       compliant in a timely manner.
 
     all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
these factors and the cautionary statements contained herein.
 
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
 
     we have exposure to interest rate volatility primarily relating to interest
rate changes applicable to revolving loans under our bank credit facility. these
loans bear interest at rates which vary with changes in (i) the london interbank
offered rate (libor) or (ii) a rate of interest announced publicly by bank of
america nt&amp;sa.;
 
     we do not speculate on the future direction of interest rates. as of
january 30, 1999, approximately $44.9 million of our debt bore interest at
variable rates. we believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near
term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows would not be significant.
 
item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
 
     see index to consolidated financial statements.
 
item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure.
 
     none.

    "employment contracts" below.
(g) amounts shown primarily represent the cash payment made on the vesting date
    for the restricted stock (as each such term is defined below) awarded 
    pursuant to the 1995 incentive plan: mr. ettore ($759,375), mr. lemire 
    ($354,375), mr. bankers, mr. lissy and mr. carter ($253,125 each). in

(a) dollar value realized represents the number of options exercised multiplied
    by the difference between the market price of ames' common stock at date of
    exercise and the strike price of the options.
 
(b) includes 125,000 sars granted to j. ettore pursuant to an employment
    contract which is more fully described below. the dollar value of the sars
    in the table is calculated by multiplying the number of sars times the
    difference between (i) $2.00 (representing the exercise price of certain
    rights surrendered by mr. ettore in connection with the ettore agreement (as
    defined)) and (ii) $28.741, the average closing price of a share of common
    stock during the twenty trading days prior to january 30, 1999.
 
     all sars granted to members of management in connection with the ames'
emergence from chapter 11 protection in 1992 expired as of december 30, 1997.
during fiscal 1997, a total of 166,683 such sars were exercised.
 
long-term incentive plan awards
 
     there were 215,000 shares of restricted stock (35,000 pursuant to the 1995
incentive plan and 180,000 pursuant to the 1998 incentive plan as defined
previously) awarded to certain executive officers during fiscal year 1998.
 
     ames' 1995 incentive plan was approved by the stockholders on may 24, 1995.
the purpose of the 1995 incentive plan is to promote ames' long term success by
affording certain officers with an opportunity to acquire an ownership interest
in ames in order to incentivize such persons and to align their financial
interests with ames' stockholders. pursuant to the 1995 incentive plan, ames may
make awards ("awards") of an aggregate of up to 500,000 shares of common stock
that are subject to restrictions on transfer thereof ("restricted stock") and a
cash payment (a "cash payment") in an amount up to 50% of the fair market value
(as defined in the 1995 incentive plan) of the restricted stock determined as
of, and paid on, the third anniversary of the date of grant (the "vesting
date"). the cash payment is intended to defray a substantial portion of an award
recipient's federal and state income tax liabilities on the award (including the
cash payment) in order to allow the recipient to receive the restricted stock
substantially free and clear on the vesting date.
 
     officers eligible for awards under the 1995 incentive plan are the chief
executive officer, each executive vice president and each senior vice president.
the compensation committee administers the 1995 incentive plan. during 1998,
there were 35,000 shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to the 1995
incentive plan. as of january 30, 1999, 295,000 shares in the aggregate had
vested, and 60,000 shares remain unvested.
 
     the 1998 incentive plan (as defined above) was approved by the stockholders
in may 1998. the purpose of the 1998 incentive plan is intended to provide
incentives which will attract, retain and motivate highly competent persons as
key employees by providing them opportunities to acquire shares of common stock
or receive
 
                                       25
<page>
monetary payments based on the value of such shares. the 1998 incentive plan
makes available for awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive plan) an aggregate
amount of 1,800,000 shares of common stock. the maximum number of shares of
common stock with respect to which awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive
plan) may be granted (or measured) to any individual participant may not exceed
300,000. common stock awarded under the 1998 incentive plan vests 50% on the
fourth anniversary from the date of grant and 50% on the fifth anniversary.
there is no cash payment to be made related to the vesting of the grant.
 
     officers eligible for awards under the 1998 incentive plan are such key
employees of ames as the board of directors in its sole discretion determines to
be significantly responsible for the success, future growth and profitability of
ames. during 1998, there were 195,000 shares of restricted stock issued pursuant
to the 1998 incentive plan and as of january 30, 1999, all 180,000 shares remain
unvested.
 
annual incentive compensation plan
 
     ames has an annual incentive compensation plan (the "annual bonus plan")
that is subject to annual review by the compensation committee and the board of
directors. the annual bonus plan provides annual incentive cash bonuses based on
the achievement of ames' financial goals for the year (as well as customer
service goals for store and field management). pursuant to the annual bonus
plan, bonuses for fiscal year 1998 will be paid in may 1999. participants must
be active ames employees at the time the bonus payments are made to earn a
bonus.
 
retirement and savings plan
 
     ames has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the
"retirement and savings plan") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. employees who have
reached the age of 21 are eligible to participate after one year of service
provided they have completed at least 1,000 hours of service in a 12-month
period. for each participant's contribution (up to a maximum of 5% of such
participant's total compensation), ames contributes to the retirement and
savings plan an amount equal to 50% of such contribution. a participant may
contribute to the plan from 1% to 18% of annual compensation on a pre-tax or
after-tax basis, or a combination of both. participants who terminate their
employment with ames are entitled to receive the full amount of their
contributions and, depending on the length of the participant's service to ames,
a portion of ames' matching contributions.
 
     the following table sets forth as to the named executive officers (those
listed in the summary compensation table), and all other officers and employees
of ames as a group, the aggregate matching contributions by ames under the
retirement and savings plan during fiscal year 1998:

retirement plan
 
     ames has an unfunded retirement plan for officers/directors (the
"retirement plan"). it provides that every person who is employed by ames when
he or she retires, dies or becomes disabled and who serves as both a full-time
officer and a director of ames and has completed five years of service, not
necessarily consecutive, in both of these capacities, is eligible for benefits
under the retirement plan.
 
     benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon termination of
employment due to retirement, death or disability. the annual benefit is equal
to two-thirds of the participant's average annual base salary during the
five-year period of highest compensation preceding such termination of
employment. the maximum annual benefit under the retirement plan is $100,000,
reduced by an amount equal to certain of such participant's annual
 
                                       26
<page>
social security benefits. each participant in the retirement plan is entitled to
benefits for a period of 10 years. upon the earlier death of the participant, at
ames' option, the future payments as scheduled or the then present value of all
unpaid benefits would be paid to the participant's estate. joseph ettore,
current president, chief executive officer and director, potentially qualifies
for benefits under this plan. as of january 30, 1999, mr. ettore had completed
approximately fifty-six months of credited service as a full-time officer and
director of ames. no payments were made under this plan in fiscal year 1998.
 
compensation of directors
 
     ames' directors who are not full-time ames employees (the "outside
directors") receive a base fee of $40,000 in director's fees ($80,000 per year
for the chairman) for six regular meetings and $3,000 for each additional board
meeting and are reimbursed for their expenses. directors are also compensated at
the rate of $10,000 per year for up to four meetings for each committee on which
they serve and $2,500 for each additional committee meeting. for fiscal year
1998, board activity and meetings exceeded the anticipated number of regular
meetings. the directors, however, determined to limit their compensation for
fiscal year 1998 to the base fee, and to forego any additional compensation for
additional meetings.
 
     pursuant to ames' 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan, as amended
(the "amended non-employee plan"), directors who are not full-time ames
employees are granted options to purchase common stock of ames on the date of
each annual meeting of stockholders of the company. commencing with the may 27,
1998 annual meeting, the number of shares granted on the date of each annual
meeting is 7,500. all options terminate ten years after date of grant. the
exercise prices of the options are equal to the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. the options become exercisable in full six months
after date of grant. as of january 30, 1999, messrs. basile, buxbaum, cohen and
pearlman had been granted 22,500 options each and mr. felner and ms. shahon had
been granted 15,000 options each.

participant will receive a lump sum cash severance payment. the severance
payment is 2.99 times base compensation for the president and executive vice
presidents, 2 times base compensation for senior vice presidents and selected
vice presidents, and 1 times base compensation for other vice presidents. base
compensation is defined generally as the sum of the participant's annual base
compensation in effect immediately prior to the participant's termination plus
one-third of the value of the cash and stock bonuses paid to the participant
during the 36 months ending on the date of termination. for purposes of the
continuity plan, a change of control includes, but is not limited to, the
acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
company's outstanding voting securities or the failure of the individuals who
constituted the board of directors at the beginning of any period of 12
consecutive months to continue to constitute a majority of the board during such
period.

                    report of independent public accountants
 
to the stockholders and board of directors of
ames department stores, inc.:
 
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ames department
stores, inc. (a delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of january 30, 1999
and january 31, 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended
january 30, 1999, and the fifty-three weeks ended january 31, 1998 and the
fifty-two weeks ended january 25, 1997. these consolidated financial statements
and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the company's
management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
we conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ames department stores, inc.
and subsidiaries as of january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended january 30,
1999, and the fifty-three weeks ended january 31, 1998 and the fifty-two weeks
ended january 25, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
 
our audits were performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. the schedule listed in the index to
consolidated financial statements is presented for the purpose of complying with
the securities and exchange commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. this schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

(collectively, "ames" or the "company") are retail merchandisers. as of
march 1, 1999, ames operated 453 discount department stores in 19 states in the
northeast, midwest and mid-atlantic regions, as well as the district of
columbia. the stores are located in rural communities, small cities and the
suburbs of larger metropolitan areas.
 
     in 1999, the company will remodel and convert substantially all of the
acquired hills stores to ames stores. the remodeling and conversion process is
being conducted in three stages, each stage involving approximately one-third of
the hills stores. the first stage is scheduled to be completed in late april
1999; the second and third stages are scheduled to be completed in july 1999 and
september 1999, respectively.
 
  (b) basis of presentation:
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
 
  (c) change in fiscal year:
 
     the company changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to
the saturday nearest january 31, effective with the fiscal year ended january
30, 1999. this change was made so that the company's fiscal year would coincide
with the fiscal year of most other publicly-held retailers. there was no impact
on the current year period as a result of this change. the fiscal year ended
january 30, 1999 ("fiscal 1998" or "1998") included 52 weeks. the fiscal year
ended january 31, 1998 ("fiscal 1997" or "1997") included 53 weeks. the fiscal
year ended january 25, 1997 ("fiscal 1996" or "1996") included 52 weeks.
 
  (d) principles of consolidation:
 
     the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ames and its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. all intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
 
  (e) cash and short-term investments:
 
     ames considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash and short-term investments.
 
  (f) inventory valuation:
 
     inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
(fifo) method, or market and include the capitalization of transportation and
distribution center costs.
 
  (g) fixed assets:
 
     land and buildings, fixtures and equipment, and leasehold improvements are
recorded at cost. major replacements and betterments are capitalized.
maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred. the cost of assets
sold or retired and the related amounts of accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal, with the resulting gain or
loss included in earnings.

            notes to consolidated financial statements--(continued)
 
1. summary of significant accounting policies:--(continued)
  (h) intangible assets:
 
     beneficial lease rights represent the excess of fair market value over
contract value of certain of the leases acquired in the hills acquisition (as
defined in note 2 below). goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair
value of net tangible assets acquired at the date of the hills acquisition. see
note 2 for further explanation.
 
  (i) depreciation and amortization:
 
     land and buildings and fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. property
under capital leases and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms.
 
     beneficial lease rights are being amortized over the terms of the related
leases (which average approximately 25 years). goodwill is being amortized over
a 25-year period.
 
     the excess of revalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting
is being amortized over a 10-year period. the amount recorded as a credit to
depreciation and amortization was $6.2 million in each of fiscal 1998, fiscal
1997 and fiscal 1996.
 
     the unfavorable lease liability is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over the applicable lease terms.
 
     depreciation and amortization includes adjustments recorded pursuant to the
application of statement of financial accounting standards no. 121, "accounting
for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed
of." the company did not record an impairment loss during fiscal 1998. during
fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, the company recorded impairment losses of
$1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
 
  (j) deferred charges:
 
     pursuant to sop 98-5, "reporting on the costs of start-up activities,"
expenses related to new store openings are expensed when incurred. see
note 18--recently issued accounting standards.
 
     debt transaction costs and related issue expenses are deferred and
amortized over the term of the associated debt. lease acquisition and related
costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease.
 
  (k) income taxes:
 
     ames files a consolidated federal income tax return. in december 1992, ames
adopted statement of financial accounting standards no. 109, "accounting for
income taxes" ("sfas no. 109") under fresh-start reporting. under this method,
any deferred income taxes recorded are provided for at currently effective
statutory rates on the differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for
tax and financial reporting purposes. if recorded, deferred income taxes are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based upon the
expected future period in which such deferred income taxes are anticipated to
reverse.
 
  (l) self-insurance reserves:
 
     the company is self-insured for workers' compensation, general liability,
property and casualty, and accident and health insurance claims, subject to
certain limitations. the company has insurance coverage for losses that may
occur above certain levels. the company determines its liability for claims
based on the circumstances of each individual claim and estimates its liability
for claims incurred but not yet reported based on historical experience. as of
january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, ames had established self-insurance
reserves of $66.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively. the long-term portion
of these reserves is classified as part of other long-term liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. these reserves are subject to changes in estimates
as claims are settled or continue to remain outstanding.

  (m) leased department and other income:
 
     ames has an agreement with an independent contractor that allows the
independent contractor to operate shoe departments within the ames stores. ames
receives a percentage of the sales under the agreement.
 
  (n) earnings per common share:
 
     in february 1997 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no. 128, "earnings per share" ("sfas
no. 128"). under sfas no. 128, the presentation of primary and fully diluted
earnings per share was replaced by basic and diluted earnings per share. the
company adopted the provisions of sfas no. 128 effective january 31, 1998, and
has restated all periods presented.
 
     net income per common share for each of fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
determined by using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during that fiscal year. common equivalent shares represented
the assumed exercise of the company's outstanding series b and series c warrants
and stock options.
 
  (o) stock-based compensation:
 
     statement of financial accounting standards no. 123, "accounting for
stock-based compensation," ("sfas no. 123") encourages, but does not require
companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans at fair value. the company has chosen to continue to account for
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
accounting principles board opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued to
employees," ("apb opinion no. 25") and related interpretations. accordingly,
compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the company's stock at the date of grant over the
exercise price of the options.
 
2. acquisition and agency agreement:
 
  acquisition of hills stores company
 
     on december 31, 1998, hsc acquisition corp. ("hsc"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of the company, acquired 81.3% of the outstanding common stock and
74.4% of the outstanding convertible preferred stock of hills stores company
("hills") pursuant to a tender offer made in implementation of an agreement and
plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), dated as of november 12, 1998, by and
among the company, hsc and hills. at the closing of that acquisition (the "hills
acquisition"), a total of $114.5 million was disbursed as follows:
 
     o $12.7 million to hills common shareholders for 81.3% of the shares
       outstanding
 
     o $1.0 million to holders of hills series a convertible preferred stock for
       74.4% of the shares outstanding
 
     o $100.8 million to holders of hills 12 1/2% senior notes for 73.9% of the
       notes outstanding
 
     the amount paid to the holders of the hills senior notes represented a
discount of approximately 30% from the face value of the acquired notes.
 
     holders of the hills shares and senior notes who tendered their securities
for purchase also received a deferred contingent right to receive a further cash
payment out of, and based upon, hills ultimate net recovery, if any, in a
lawsuit brought by hills in september 1995 against certain of its former
directors. the outcome of this lawsuit, whether favorable or unfavorable, would
result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition.

            notes to consolidated financial statements--(continued)
 
2. acquisition and agency agreement:--(continued)
     subsequent to the acquisition date, hills was merged with hsc. upon the
effectiveness of that merger, the company paid $3.3 million to retire the
remaining common and preferred shares of hills. the company also incurred
professional fees, accounting, legal and other costs of approximately
$12.2 million in connection with the acquisition. these costs have been
accounted for as part of the purchase price. the hills acquisition was funded by
cash provided by operations and borrowings under the company's 1998 credit
agreement. (see note 6.)
 
     the acquisition has been recorded under the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the results of operations of hills for the period from
december 31, 1998 through january 30, 1999 are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. the aggregate purchase price of $130 million
has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a
preliminary determination of respective fair market values at the date of
acquisition and is subject to adjustment. the fair value of tangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed was $477 million and $637 million,
respectively. the balance of the purchase price, $290 million, was recorded as
two components: an excess of cost over net assets acquired (goodwill) of
$231 million, which is being amortized over 25 years on a straight-line basis,
and beneficial lease rights of $59 million, which is being amortized over the
life of the respective leases (which average approximately 25 years).
 
     in connection with the acquisition, management determined that certain
previously capitalized technology costs, intangible assets, property and
equipment and other assets of hills had no future use to the company. as a
result, these assets have been effectively written-off in connection with the
acquisition, and have been reflected at "zero value" (or adjusted estimated fair
value where appropriate) in the above summary of fair value of assets assumed.
in addition, due to the agency agreement discussed below, certain fair value
adjustments were recorded to inventory and related accounts.
 
     at the time of the acquisition, hills operated 155 discount department
stores. in 1999, the company will remodel and convert 150 of the hills stores to
ames stores. the five remaining hills stores will be closed because they are in
locations that are either competitive with other ames stores or are
underperforming. the remodeling and conversion process will be conducted in
three stages, each stage involving approximately one third of the hills stores.
the first stage is scheduled to be completed in late april 1999; the second and
third stages are scheduled to be completed in july 1999, and september 1999,
respectively.
 
  agency agreement overview
 
     concurrent with the hills acquisition, the company entered into a
transition and agency agreement (the "agency agreement") with gordon brothers
retail partners, llc and the nassi group, llc (collectively the "agent"), which
provides that the agent serve for a period of time to operate all of the
acquired hills stores and to conduct inventory liquidation sales at each of
those stores prior to its scheduled remodeling or final closure. accordingly,
the agent is managing the sale of the inventory acquired in the hills
acquisition as well as certain other inventory identified in the agency
agreement (collectively the "merchandise").
 
     the agency agreement is based upon the company providing hills merchandise
having a minimum initial retail value or selling price of $625.0 million for the
agent to manage, including both store merchandise and distribution center
merchandise, on-hand at the time of the acquisition, as well as committed
on-order merchandise. the agency agreement entitles the company to receive out
of the sale proceeds a minimum amount (the "guaranteed amount") equal to 40% of
the initial retail value or initial ticketed selling price of the merchandise
(the "guaranteed return"). an additional payment may be made to the company if
proceeds of sale exceed a target percentage of the initial retail value. the
agency agreement further entitles the company to reimbursement of certain store
operating expenses (e.g., payroll, rent, advertising, etc.) out of the sale
proceeds during the agency period.

                 ames department stores, inc. and subsidiaries
            notes to consolidated financial statements--(continued)
 
2. acquisition and agency agreement:--(continued)
     the agent will be paid a fee (the "agency fee") for its services pursuant
to the agency agreement. the agency fee will be an amount equal to the proceeds
from the sales of hills merchandise less a deduction for the reimbursement of
store operating expenses and the guaranteed return.
 
     as a result of the above terms and provisions, the company valued the
acquired hills inventory at an amount equal to the guaranteed return, which
resulted in an opening balance sheet adjustment to reduce inventory by
approximately $131.0 million. in addition, the company has recorded a purchase
commitment valuation liability of approximately $37.5 million with respect to
the prior purchase commitments of hills for merchandise ordered prior to the
hills acquisition which the company is legally required to honor. the recording
of this valuation liability will result in an inventory valuation for these
committed purchases that approximates 40% of initial retail value.
 
  agency agreement accounting
 
     as discussed earlier, the results of operations of hills since the date of
the hills acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. for the month of january 1999, and for the duration of the
agency agreement, the following accounting treatment has been, and will be,
applied to recognize the results of the hills stores prior to their conversion
to ames stores during fiscal 1999. hills net sales will be recorded as "hills
net sales" and represent net sales achieved by the hills stores prior to their
conversion to ames stores. "hills cost of merchandise sold" represents the cost
of merchandise sold in connection with the hills net sales as adjusted for the
guaranteed return amount mentioned above. "hills operating expenses and agency
fees " include the following: the associated store expenses incurred while
operating the hills stores prior to their conversion to ames stores, which are
reimbursable to the company out of the proceeds of hills merchandise sales per
the agency agreement; the agency fee due to the agent for the period presented;
and other expenses (e.g., non-store payroll, non-store rent, etc.) associated
with supporting the hills stores prior to their conversion to ames stores, which
are not reimbursable under the agency agreement.
 
     the agency fee amount was determined based upon the hills sales results for
the period, less the guaranteed return and reimbursable hills store expenses, as
specified in the agency agreement. because the company is entitled to a
guaranteed return and reimbursement of hills store expenses during the term of
the agency agreement, it is anticipated that the company will realize "agency
income" during the latter stages of the agency agreement after the sale proceeds
from the liquidation of hills merchandise decrease as a percentage of the
initial retail value. as a result, any agency fee calculated on an interim basis
may not be indicative of the total fee to be remitted to the agent. the agency
fee will only be determined after a final accounting for all revenues and
expenses earned/incurred during the entire agency period. the final accounting
will be completed during the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

     in january 1999, the hills stores were being operated pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the agency agreement (see note 2). approximately one-third of
the hills stores were conducting liquidation sales during january 1999 in order
to prepare these stores for their conversion to ames stores. the cost of
merchandise for hills represents the merchandise sold during january 1999
adjusted for the guaranteed return (see note 2). the selling, general and
administrative expenses for hills include reimbursable store operating expenses
of $25.4 million; agency fee of $21.7 million; and other non-reimbursable
expenses of $4.8 million. the depreciation and amortization expense for hills
includes the depreciation and amortization of the revalued fixed assets, the
amortization of the beneficial lease rights and the goodwill recorded in the
hills acquisition. the interest expense reflects interest on the debt, capital
lease and financing obligations assumed in the hills acquisition.
 
     the "other costs and charges" column in the foregoing table consists of:
the cost to exit certain ames contractual obligations rendered obsolete by the
hills acquisition; the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the
company's 1996 credit agreement; the incremental interest expense incurred in
january in connection with financing the purchase price of hills and the charge
recorded in connection with the announced closing of seven ames stores that are
scheduled to close in 1999. the closings are part of planned closings resulting
from the overlap in certain ames and hills locations.
 
4. cash and short-term investments:
 
     as of january 30, 1999 there were no short-term investments. as of january
31, 1998 short-term investments totaled $37.9 million. these investments
consisted of time deposits, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances,
repurchase agreements and high grade commercial paper.
 
5. inventories:
 
     inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
(fifo) method, or market and include the capitalization of transportation and
distribution center costs.

the credit agreement
 
     on december 31, 1998, in connection with the hills acquisition (see note
2), certain of the company's subsidiaries entered into an agreement (the "credit
agreement") with a syndicate of other banks and financial institutions for whom
bank of america nt&amp;sa; is serving as agent. the credit agreement provides for a
secured revolving credit facility of up to $650 million, with a sublimit of
$150 million for letters of credit.
 
     the credit agreement replaced a $320 million secured revolving credit
facility (the 1996 credit agreement).
 
     the credit agreement is in effect until june 30, 2002 and is secured by
substantially all of the assets of the company. the interest rate per annum on
borrowings under the credit agreement is equal to the base rate (as defined in
the credit agreement) plus 0.625% (subject to downward adjustments).
alternatively, the interest rate per annum may be equal to libor rate (as
defined in the credit agreement) plus 2.25% (subject to downward adjustments).
 
     fees required under the credit agreement include: (a) monthly commitment
fees on the unused portion of the facility; (b) an initial closing fee and
(c) an initial agency fee and annual collateral management fees for the account
of the agent.
 
     for fiscal 1998, the weighted average interest rate on the company's
revolving credit facilities was 7.57% and the peak borrowing level was $148.3
million. as of january 30, 1999, borrowings under the credit agreement were
$44.9 million (at a weighted average interest rate per annum of 7.57%) and $3.3
million and $11.0 million was outstanding in trade and standby letters of
credit, respectively.
 
     the amount of borrowing under the credit agreement may not exceed the sum
of (a) an amount equal to 70% or 75% of certain inventory in the possession of
the company (depending on the period of year as provided for in the credit
agreement) plus (b) an amount equal to 50% of certain inventory not in the
possession of the company, but covered by any outstanding letter of credit. the
agent, in addition, reserves the right to adjust the total available to be
borrowed by establishing reserves, making determinations of eligible inventory,
revising standards of eligibility or decreasing from time to time the
percentages set forth above.
 
     the financial covenants under the credit agreement are limited to: minimum
borrowing availability; for the quarter ended april 2000, minimum ebitda (as
defined below) and, thereafter, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as
defined in the credit agreement). ebitda is defined as: income before
(a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense or benefit, (c) depreciation and
amortization expense, stock appreciation rights accruals, certain restructuring
charges and other non-cash charges.

mansfield, massachusetts.
 
senior notes due 2003
 
     the 12.5% senior notes due 2003 (the "senior notes") were, at the time of
the hills acquisition (see note 2), an unsecured obligation of hills.
 
     pursuant to the merger agreement, the company, in november 1998, made a
tender offer to purchase at a stated discount all of hills' outstanding senior
notes, which at the time totaled $195.0 million. upon expiration of the tender
offer, the company on december 31, 1998, paid cash of $100.8 million (including
the related accrued interest) to acquire senior notes having a face value of
$144.1 million. senior notes with a face value balance of $50.9 million remain
outstanding.
 
     the tendering holders of the senior notes, representing 73.9% of the then
outstanding senior notes, consented to certain modifications to the indenture
governing the senior notes. included among the modifications were the deletion
of the sections covering reporting requirements, debt and lien incurrence and
asset sales and additional subsidiary guarantees.
 
     as of january 30, 1999, the payments due on long-term debt for the next
five years and thereafter were as follows:

the authorized capital stock of ames consisted of 43,000,000 shares divided into
two classes: (i) 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $.01 per
share (the "preferred stock"), and (ii) 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $.01 per share (the "common stock").
 
     there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of january 30, 1999
and january 31, 1998. there were 23,921,545 and 22,506,108 shares of common
stock outstanding as of january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, respectively.
 
     the board of directors of the company may authorize the issuance of one or
more series of preferred stock and specify for each such series the voting
powers (but no greater than one vote per share), designations, preferences, and
relative, participating, optional, redemption, conversion, exchange or other
special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series, and
the number of shares in each series.
 
     holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all
matters to be voted upon by stockholders and are entitled to receive dividends
when, as and if declared by the board of directors. dividends cannot be declared
under the terms of the credit agreement.
 
     the common stock does not have any preemptive right or subscription or
redemption privilege. the common stock also does not have cumulative voting
rights, which means the holder or holders of more than half of the shares voting
for the election of directors can elect all the directors then being elected.
all of the shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.
 
treasury stock
 
     in august 1998, the company's board of directors approved a stock
repurchase program and authorized management to purchase up to 1.5 million
shares of common stock. during fiscal 1998, the company acquired 79,495 shares
of its common stock. during the course of the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 1998, the company suspended further purchases due to the pending
acquisition of hills.
 
warrants
 
     an aggregate of 200,000 series b warrants were issued on december 30, 1992.
each such warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at
any time from june 30, 1993 through december 30, 2000. the exercise price is
$5.92 per share. during fiscal 1998, 100,000 series b warrants were exercised.
 
     an aggregate of 2,120,000 series c warrants were issued on december 30,
1992. each such warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common
stock at any time from june 30, 1993 through january 31, 1999. the exercise
price was $1.11 per share. during fiscal 1998, 723,867 series c warrants were
exercised. on january 31, 1999, 8,635 series c warrants expired.
 
     the exercise prices of the above warrants are subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of certain events, including, among other things, the payment of
a stock dividend, a merger or consolidation and the issuance for consideration
of rights, options or warrants (other than rights to purchase common stock
issued to shareholders generally) to acquire common stock.
 
     a holder of any of the warrants described above will not be entitled to any
rights as a stockholder of the company, including, without limitation, the right
to vote the underlying shares of common stock, until the holder has exercised
the warrants.

stock purchase rights agreement
 
     on november 30, 1994, the company adopted a stock purchase rights agreement
(the "rights agreement"). under the terms of the rights agreement, one purchase
right ("right"), with an exercise price of $14.00, is attached to each share of
common stock outstanding as of, or issued subsequent to, november 30, 1994 but
prior to the occurrence of certain events (as more fully described in the rights
agreement). the rights become exercisable in the event that a person or group
(an "acquiring person") either acquires 15% or more of the company's outstanding
voting stock or announces an intention to acquire 20% or more of such stock.
once exercisable, each right will, depending on the circumstances, entitle a
holder, other than an acquiring person, to purchase shares of either the company
or an acquiring company having a market value equal to twice the exercise price.
the rights agreement was adopted to assure that all of the company's
stockholders receive full value for their investment in the event of stock
accumulation by an acquiring person. unless previously redeemed by the company,
the rights will expire on november 29, 2004.
 
9. stock options:
 
     the 1998 stock incentive plan (the "1998 incentive plan"), approved by
stockholders in may 1998, provides for the grant of awards (as defined in the
1998 incentive plan) and makes available for awards an aggregate amount of
1,800,000 shares of common stock. the maximum number of shares of common stock
with respect to which awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive plan) may be
granted (or measured) to any individual may not exceed 300,000. with respect to
such awards under the 1998 incentive plan, the company may grant awards in the
form of options to purchase common stock provided that the exercise price shall
not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date
the stock option is granted.
 
     pursuant to the 1994 management stock option plan (the "1994 option plan")
approved by stockholders in june 1994, the company may grant options with
respect to an aggregate of up to 1,700,000 shares of common stock, with no
individual optionee to receive in excess of 200,000 shares of common stock upon
exercise of options granted. the exercise prices of the options are equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date the options are granted. the
options become exercisable over one to five years and terminate after five to
ten years from the grant date.
 
     pursuant to the 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan (the
"non-employee plan") approved by stockholders in may 1995, the company may grant
to non-employee directors options to purchase up to an aggregate of 200,000
shares of common stock. the exercise prices of the options are equal to the fair
market value of the common stock on the date the options are granted. the
options become exercisable in full six months after date of grant and terminate
ten years after date of grant. effective on the date of each annual meeting of
stockholders of the company commencing with the 1996 annual meeting, each
non-employee director of the company then in office was granted an option to
purchase 2,500 shares, with the date of grant to be the date of such meeting. at
the 1998 annual meeting, the stockholders approved an amendment to the non-
employee plan increasing the number of options granted on the date of each
annual meeting from 2,500 to 7,500 effective as of the may 27, 1998 grant. as of
january 30, 1999, 120,000 options had been granted under the non-employee plan;

date of grant using the black-scholes pricing model with the following
assumptions: no dividend yield, expected option volatilities, a risk-free
interest rate equal to u.s. treasury securities with a maturity equal to the
expected life of the option (weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, 6.4% and
6.4% for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively) and an expected life from date of

10. income taxes:
 
     the company adopted sfas no. 109 in conjunction with the adoption of
fresh-start reporting in december 1992. under sfas no. 109, deferred income
taxes are recognized by applying the enacted statutory tax rates in future years
to the changes in "cumulative temporary differences" (the differences between
financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities).
 
     as a consequence of the adoption of fresh-start reporting and sfas no. 109,
any tax benefits realized for tax purposes after the consummation date for
pre-consummation cumulative temporary differences, as well as for the
pre-consummation net operating loss carryovers, are reported as additions to
paid-in capital (see consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity)
rather than as reductions in the tax provisions in the consolidated statements
of operations. tax benefits or liabilities realized for book purposes after the
consummation date will be segregated from the pre-consummation deferred tax
assets. the utilization of post-consummation deferred tax assets may reduce
future income tax provisions. such income tax provisions have no impact on the
company's taxes payable or cash flows.
 
     on december 31, 1998, the company completed its acquisition of
approximately 81.3% of the outstanding common stock of hills. accordingly, the
tax data presented for fiscal 1998 reflects the tax effects of the acquisition,
including the temporary differences created by the application of purchase
accounting.
 
     for fiscal 1998, the company recorded an income tax provision of $18.8
million, of which approximately $0.5 million will be paid in cash. for fiscal
1997, the company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $19.1
million of which $0.3 million was paid in cash.
 
     the provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

     the company has reduced its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets
by $95.0 million, after consideration for recording additional valuation
allowances to offset net deferred tax assets recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition, during fiscal 1998, which reflects the company's expectation
of utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets
in the foreseeable future (2 years)

after considering an adjustment for unusual activity and potential
contingencies. the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a
corresponding addition to paid-in-capital.
 
     a significant portion of the ames deferred tax assets (including those
created by the hills acquisition) continue to require a valuation allowance
because of the uncertainty of future recognition of such deductions. in
subsequent periods, ames may further reduce the valuation allowances, provided
that the possibility of utilization of the deferred tax asset is more likely
than not to occur, as defined by sfas no. 109. any such reduction in the
valuation allowance in the near future will result in a corresponding addition
to paid-in-capital for the ames component of the deferred asset and to goodwill
for the hills components.
 
     the company has treated "pre-emergence net operating losses" (qualified
losses incurred prior to the consummation date) under section 382(1) (5) of the
internal revenue code ("irc"). there is approximately $409.0 million of
pre-emergence and approximately $35.0 million of post-emergence net operating
losses currently available as carryovers without any annual limitation. these
losses will expire between 2007 and 2012. additionally, the company has filed a
$20 million refund claim under section 172(f) of the internal revenue code. the
claim represents a 10-year carryback of qualified expenses and is currently
under review by the internal revenue service ("irs"). the claim, if successful,
will reduce net operating losses by approximately $47.0 million.
 
     in addition, ames has targeted jobs tax credit carryovers of approximately
$7.0 million, which will expire in 2007, and alternative minimum tax credit
carryovers of approximately $4.0 million, which have no expiration period.
federal net operating loss carryovers for fiscal years subsequent to
january 27, 1990 are subject to future adjustments, if any, by the irs.
 
     as a result of the acquisition of the common stock of the hills stores
company, ames has succeeded to the tax attributes of hills, including net
operating losses of $178.0 million and general business credits of
$11.0 million. these tax attributes expire between 2000 and 2013. ames also has
succeeded to minimum tax credit carryforwards of $5.0 million, which do not
expire. these tax attributes are significantly limited under internal revenue
code sections 382 and 383, respectively, as a result of the change in control
caused by the hills acquisition and the resulting deferred tax asset has been
reduced accordingly.
 
     ames and hills have substantial potential state net operating loss
carryovers. it is difficult, however, to quantify the utilizable amounts of such
state operating losses because of the uncertainty related to the mix of future
profits in specific states.
 
     the irs has completed its audit of hills for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 fiscal
years. the final outcome of this examination will not have an adverse effect on
the company. hills has filed a claim for a refund of federal taxes for the
subsequent years. the refund claim, if successful, is approximately
$7.0 million. if the company receives this refund amount, there will be a
corresponding adjustment to reduce goodwill recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition.

     ames has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the "ames
retirement and savings plan") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, for employees who, after one
year of service, have reached the age of 21 and have completed at least 1,000
hours of service in a 12-month period. for each participant's contribution (up
to a maximum of 5% of such participant's total compensation), the company
contributes to the retirement and savings plan an amount equal to 50% of

such contribution. ames funds all administrative costs incurred by the plan.
ames' expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately $3.3 million,
$3.0 million and $2.9 million, in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
  hills plan
 
     hills has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the "hills
retirement and savings plan ") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, for full-time employees
who are eligible to participate at the first of each calendar quarter and for
all regular and part-time employees who, after one year of service have
completed at least 1,000 hours of service in a 12-month period. for each
participant's contribution (after one year of service) hills contributes 100% of
the first 2% from service years 1-3 and 100% of the first 4% for service years 4
and over. hills funds all administrative costs incurred by the plan with certain
exceptions. the expense associated with this plan was $0.3 million for january
1999.
 
     the company intends to merge the two retirement and savings plans after
further review and consideration of how to structure the merged plan and how to
transition to the merged plan.
 
retirement plan
 
     ames has an unfunded retirement plan for officers/directors (the
"retirement plan"). it provides that every person who is employed by ames when
he or she retires, dies or becomes disabled and who serves as both a full-time
officer and a director of ames and has completed five years of service, not
necessarily consecutive, in both of these capacities, is eligible for benefits
under the retirement plan.
 
     the maximum annual benefit under the retirement plan is $100,000, reduced
by certain of each participant's annual social security benefits. each
participant in the retirement plan is entitled to benefits for a period of 10
years. the company has a reserve established for potential payments under the
retirement plan. no payments were made under this plan during the periods
presented.
 
the g.c. murphy company life insurance plan
 
     the g.c. murphy company life insurance plan (the "gcm plan") granted a flat
dollar amount (defined benefit) of group term life insurance at no cost to
certain retired employees. this plan excludes g.c. murphy co. employees who
retired from ames after january 31, 1986. the amount of coverage varies by
retiree, is payable only upon death, and has no loan or cash value. during 1997,
the company entered into a contract with an insurance company which effectively
transferred to the insurance company all future liabilities associated with the
gcm plan in exchange for fixed annual payments over ten years.
 
annual incentive compensation plan

  wage and hour litigation
 
     since march 1995, the company has been named as a defendant in several
class action complaints which allege that the company was obligated to pay
overtime to its hardlines and softlines assistant store managers. the company
has consistently stated its belief that these positions are appropriately
designated as exempt positions not calling for overtime pay. the company has
settled several of these cases. these settlements have not required any change
in the company's treatment of the status of its hardlines and softlines
assistant managers. the company is vigorously defending one remaining case which
it does not believe represents a material exposure.

14. fair values of financial instruments:
 
     the financial accounting standards board requires disclosure of the fair
value of financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards
no. 107, "disclosures about fair value of financial instruments". the following
methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating the fair value
disclosures for its financial instruments.
 
     the company's financial instruments as of january 30, 1999 and january 31,
1998 were cash and short-term investments, long-term debt, and the series c
warrants, which expired on january 30, 1999. for cash and short-term
investments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets
approximated fair values. for long-term debt obligations, the fair values were
estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis (based upon the company's
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements). the
fair value of the series c warrants was based on the market trading price at
year-end times the number of such warrants that were outstanding.
 
     the carrying amounts and fair values of the company's financial instruments
at january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998 were as follows:

     in december 1996, the company terminated a prior credit agreement (note 6)
and recorded a non-cash extraordinary charge of $1.4 million, net of tax benefit
of $0.6 million, for the write-off of deferred financing costs.
 
18. recently issued accounting pronouncements
 
     in april 1998, aicpa issued sop 98-5, "reporting on the costs of start-up
activities" which requires start-up costs, as defined, to be expensed as
incurred. pursuant to sop 98-5, previously capitalized start-up costs are
required to be written-off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. sop 98-5 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after december 15, 1998.

18. recently issued accounting pronouncements--(continued)
     the company elected early adoption of sop 98-5 during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1998, retroactively effective to the first quarter of fiscal 1998. the
company's previous policy was to expense all store pre-opening costs in the year
of opening, amortizing them from the date of opening through the balance of the
fiscal year. no cumulative effect has been recorded on the company's
consolidated statement of operations. however, the quarterly financial data
presented in note 19 has been restated to properly reflect the effect of the sop
in each of the presented quarterly results.
 
     in february 1998, the financial accounting standards board released
statement no. 132, "employers' disclosures about pensions and other
postretirement benefits" ("sfas no. 132"). this statement, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 1997, modifies and expands
disclosure requirements. adoption of sfas no. 132 will have no impact on the
company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

     these unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative
purposes only. they do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations
which actually would have resulted had the hills acquisition been consummated at
the beginning of fiscal 1997 or fiscal 1998, or of future results of operations
of the consolidated entities.
 
     the above pro forma net income and earnings per common share amounts for
the year ended january 30, 1999 reflect the previously recorded write-down of
hills deferred tax assets of approximately $49.6 million (which is net of a
reversal of approximately $5.9 million of accrued tax liabilities). excluding
the write-down of the hills deferred tax assets recorded as of october 31, 1998,
pro forma net loss and loss per common share would have been $5.3 million and
$0.23, respectively for the year ended january 30, 1999.
 
21. subsequent events:
 
     on march 4, 1999, the company entered into an agreement with caldor
corporation to purchase seven of its stores in connecticut, one store in
massachusetts and a 649,000 square foot distribution center in westfield,
massachusetts, for a cash purchase price of $40.0 million. under the terms of
the agreement, the company will assume caldor's leases for the eight stores and
the distribution center and will acquire all of the store fixtures and all
racking, sorting systems and materials handling equipment in the distribution
center.
 
     on march 26, 1999, the united states bankruptcy court for the southern
district of new york approved the company's right to purchase the leases for the
stores and the distribution center.
 
     on march 26, 1999, the company entered into an agreement with caldor
corporation for the purchase of an additional store in massachusetts for a cash
purchase price of $2.7 million. this agreement is subject to competing bids and 
the approval of the bankruptcy court.

overview
 
     ames changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to the
saturday nearest january 31, effective with the fiscal year ended january 30,
1999, which we refer to as "fiscal 1998." we made this change so that our fiscal
year would coincide with the fiscal year of most other publicly-held retailers.
fiscal 1998 consisted of 52 weeks. our fiscal year ended january 31, 1998, which
we refer to as "fiscal 1997," consisted of 53 weeks. our fiscal year ended
january 25, 1997, which we refer to as "fiscal 1996," consisted of 52 weeks.
 
     you should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in
this annual report.
 
results of operations
 
fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997
 
     on december 31, 1998, we acquired approximately 81.3% of the outstanding
voting stock of hills stores company. accordingly, the operations of hills and
its subsidiaries during the month of january 1999 are included in our
<page>

consolidated results of operations for fiscal 1998. immediately following our
acquisition of hills, we began implementing a series of initiatives to prepare
for the conversion of 150 of the hills stores into ames stores and the permanent
closure of the five remaining hills stores. these initiatives included the
termination of most of hills' corporate and administrative operations and
personnel, the announced closure of seven ames stores that we considered to be
directly competitive with acquired hills stores and the engagement of two
experienced liquidation firms, gordon brothers retail partners and the nassi
group, to operate the hills stores until their closure and to liquidate hills'
merchandise inventories.
 
     under our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group, we are
entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales, as a minimum
guaranteed amount, 40% of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory
being sold, irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold. the remaining
sale proceeds, net of the expenses of operating the stores, are payable to the
liquidators as compensation for their services, subject to additional
allocations to ames to the extent the proceeds exceed specified targets. for
financial reporting purposes, hills' net sales during the month of january
represent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales, its cost
of merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that ames is
entitled to retain, and its selling, general and administrative expenses include
the portion of those proceeds that are to be paid over to the liquidators.
 
     because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with gordon
brothers and the nassi group, as well as the fact that 50 hills stores were in
the process of liquidation, hills' results for the month of january 1999 are not
representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of
business and are not directly comparable to ames' results exclusive of hills.
the acquisition of hills also resulted in various costs and charges during the
month of january 1999 that impacted ames' consolidated results. these other
costs and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminating
contracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of hills, the write-off of
deferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility, interest expense
for borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one-time charge for the
announced closing of the seven ames stores. the following table illustrates the
separate contribution of ames' full year of operations and hills' one month of
operations to various components of the consolidated results of operations for
fiscal 1998, as well as the impact on these consolidated results of the other
costs and charges described above:

     the unique circumstances under which hills' operations have been conducted
since december 31, 1998 and the accounting treatment accorded those operations
as a consequence of our agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group
distort any direct comparison of the principal components of ames' consolidated
results for fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997. accordingly, in the discussion that
follows, ames' net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative
expense, and its leased department and other income for fiscal 1998 are
presented and compared exclusive of the hills results. the impact of the hills
acquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortization
expense and interest and debt expense.

     ames' net sales (which exclude sales from leased shoe departments)
increased 7.3%, to $2.40 billion in fiscal 1998 from $2.23 billion in fiscal
1997, due primarily to 7.2% growth in same-store sales. ames experienced
particularly strong improvements in sales of domestics, toys, ready-to-assemble
furniture and women's sportswear. in comparing results for the two fiscal years,
you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal 1997 were favorably affected by
the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores that
were closed in the beginning of fiscal 1998 and by the fact that fiscal 1997
included one additional week of operations.
 
                                       14
<page>
     ames' gross margin increased $45.7 million in fiscal 1998 compared to
fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at 28.2%. the
gross margin rate in fiscal 1998 benefitted from a higher average markup on
sales, which was partially offset by higher markdowns.
 
     ames' selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.3 million
in fiscal 1998, but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 26.0% in fiscal
1997 to 25.3% in fiscal 1998. the percentage decrease was primarily attributable
to a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense, partially
offset by an increase in health and medical costs.
 
     ames' leased department and other income increased $4.1 million, or 16.3%,
in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. the increase was due primarily to the
leased shoe department, layaway and vending income, as well as the receipt of
funds previously held in a trust.
 
     ames' depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.6 million, or
69.1%, in fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997. the increase related primarily to
new point-of-sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certain
capital leases. the hills acquisition added a further $3.2 million of
depreciation and amortization expense associated with the additional
depreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rights
and the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the hills acquisition
cost over the value of the acquired assets. we are amortizing the beneficial
lease rights using the straight-line method over the terms of the related leases
(which average approximately 25 years) and are amortizing the hills goodwill
over 25 years on a straight-line basis. the amortization of the excess of our
revalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in
fiscal 1998 as in fiscal 1997. we are amortizing this amount over a ten-year
period that will conclude in january 2003.
 
     the hills acquisition resulted in a 31.5%, or $3.7 million, increase in
consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, in fiscal 1998. debt and
capital lease obligations of hills accounted for $1.9 million of the increase.
another $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to the non-cash write-off
of deferred financing costs under ames' prior credit facility. the balance was
attributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance the costs
of the acquisition.
 
     in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, we recorded charges of $8.2 million
in connection with the announced closing of seven ames stores that are scheduled
to close in fiscal 1999. principal components of these charges are for lease
costs and the write-down of fixed assets. we have also planned for the closing
of five of the acquired hills stores and, pursuant to the purchase method of
accounting, have provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired
hills assets. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of
$1.6 million in connection with the closing of two stores, of which
$1.0 million was classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was
recorded as part of the cost of merchandise sold.
 
     we recorded an income tax provision of $18.8 million in fiscal 1998, of
which approximately $0.5 million will be paid in cash. in fiscal 1997, we
recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million, of which approximately
$0.3 million was paid in cash. see note 10 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements for an explanation of fresh-start reporting and sfas
no. 109.
 
fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996
 
     we reported improvements in sales and net earnings for fiscal 1997 over
fiscal 1996. the improvements were due to the favorable impact of our opening 21
new stores in the preceding two fiscal years, our closing of 12 underperforming
stores at the beginning of fiscal 1997 and the continued improvement in our
gross margin rate.

     net sales increased 3.3%, from $2.16 billion in fiscal 1996 to
$2.23 billion in fiscal 1997, due to an increase of 2.1% in same-store sales,
the inclusion of 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 1997 and the opening of new
stores.
 
     gross margin increased $33.5 million, or 0.6% as a percentage of net sales,
in fiscal 1997. the gross margin rate was favorably impacted by a slightly
higher average markup on sales and a reduction in markdowns. these factors were
partially offset by higher volume of "55 gold(registered) savings" senior
citizen markdowns in fiscal 1997. cost of merchandise sold in fiscal 1997
included a $0.6 million charge for inventory write-downs associated with two
stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1998. cost of merchandise sold
in fiscal 1996 included a $2.8 million charge for inventory write-downs
associated with 13 stores that were designated for closing in fiscal 1997.
 
     selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.3 million in
fiscal 1997, but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales compared to
fiscal 1996. the increase was primarily attributable to higher payroll expenses,
a substantial portion of which was related to the inclusion of an additional
week of operations and to federal minimum wage increases. insurance expense
increased due to a greater loss experience in fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal
1996.
 
     leased department and other income declined $0.7 million (or 2.7%) in
fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996, due primarily to a decline in sales at
leased shoe departments.
 
     depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.0 million, or 0.1% as
a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. depreciation and amortization expense
included impairment losses of $1.2 million in fiscal 1997 and $2.2 million in
fiscal 1996 that were recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas no. 121 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1995. depreciation and amortization also included
depreciation on capital additions subsequent to december 26, 1992, the date on
which we wrote off all of our non-current assets in connection with the adoption
of fresh-start reporting. the amortization of the excess of revalued net assets
over equity under fresh-start reporting remained the same in fiscal 1997 as in
fiscal 1996. we are amortizing this amount over a ten-year period.
 
     interest and debt expense, net of interest income, declined $7.4 million,
or 0.4% as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 1997. the reduction was
primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of deferred financing costs, a
reduction in short-term interest expense and the favorable impact of lower
outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances. the decrease in
short-term interest expense reflected a decrease in short-term borrowings
(weighted average of $66.5 million in fiscal 1997 compared to $86.1 million in
fiscal 1996) and a decrease in interest rates under our revolving credit
facility. our average outstanding long-term debt and capital lease balances
decreased to $41.3 million in fiscal 1997 from $56.3 million in fiscal 1996.
 
                                       16

     during fiscal 1997, we realized proceeds of $1.9 million from the sale of
our rights under a lease, which resulted in a deferred gain of $1.7 million to
be recognized over a 20-year period. during fiscal 1996, we sold our rights
under several leases for a total of $0.7 million in proceeds and recognized
gains totaling $0.4 million.
 
     in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, we recorded charges of $1.6 million
in connection with the closing of two stores, of which $1.0 million was
classified as a store closing charge and $0.6 million was classified as part of
the cost of merchandise sold. both of the stores closed in february 1998. in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, we recorded charges of $9.7 million in connection
with the closing of 13 stores. the $9.7 million is classified in two line items:
$6.9 million as a store closing charge and $2.8 million as part of cost of
merchandise sold.
 
     we recorded an income tax provision of $19.1 million in fiscal 1997, of
which approximately $0.3 million was paid in cash. in fiscal 1996, we recorded a
non-cash income tax provision of $8.1 million.
 
     as a result of our termination of a revolving credit facility in december
1996, we recorded in fiscal 1996 a non-cash extraordinary charge of
$1.4 million, net of tax benefit of $0.6 million. the tax benefit was recorded
as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. the charge was for the write-off
of the deferred financing costs related to the facility.
 
liquidity and capital resources
 
     our principal sources of liquidity are our bank credit facility, cash from
operations and cash on hand. our current bank credit facility consists of a
revolving credit facility of up to $650.0 million, with a sublimit of
$150.0 million for letters of credit, which expires june 30, 2002. borrowings
under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets
and we are required to meet certain financial covenants after february 2000. in
addition, we are required to maintain a minimum availability of at least
$100.0 million. our peak borrowing level in fiscal 1998 under this bank credit
facility and a predecessor facility was $148.3 million. we believe we will have
sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable
future.
 
     our cash position decreased by $22.1 million during fiscal 1998. the
decrease was due primarily to $103.9 million paid out in the acquisition of
hills (net of cash acquired), $51.6 million of capital expenditures and
$16.3 million in debt and capital lease payments, partially offset by
$111.6 million in cash from operations and $44.9 million of borrowings under our
bank credit facility. our cash position increased by $11.7 million during fiscal
1997. this increase was primarily due to $56.8 million of cash from operations,
partially offset by $32.9 million of capital expenditures and $15.7 million of
debt and capital lease payments.
 
     merchandise inventories increased by $197.7 million in fiscal 1998 due to
planned increases and the inclusion of $169.1 million of merchandise inventories
of hills. the hills inventories have been valued at approximately 40% of the
initial ticketed retail price of the merchandise, which represents the minimum
amount we are entitled to retain out of the proceeds from the liquidation of the
merchandise. our merchandise inventories increased by $32.8 million in fiscal
1997 as a result of planned increases as well as early receipts of additional
merchandise for our 40th anniversary promotion held in march 1998. we use the
first-in, first-out (fifo) method of accounting for inventories.
 
     net fixed assets increased by $288.3 million during fiscal 1998 due to the
inclusion of $230.9 million in net fixed assets of hills and $77.5 million of
capital expenditures, including $25.9 million in new point-of-sale information
equipment and related software acquired under capital leases. the hills net
fixed assets were adjusted to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition
date. in fiscal 1997, our net fixed assets increased by $19.7 million.
 
     beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value of
the acquired hills leases over contract value of those leases. we are amortizing
this amount over the terms of the related leases (which average approximately
25 years) using the straight-line method. goodwill is being amortized over
25 years using the straight-line method.
 
     accounts payable increased $173.6 million during fiscal 1998 due to
improved payment terms and the inclusion of hills accounts payable of $127.8
million as of january 30, 1999. accounts payable increased $34.2 million during
fiscal 1997 due to improved payment terms and an increase in merchandise
receipts in january 1998 over january 1997.
 
                                       17
<page>
     long-term debt as of january 30, 1999 consisted of borrowings under our
bank credit facility of $44.9 million and $50.9 million of hills senior notes
that remained outstanding after the acquisition.
 
     capital lease and financing obligations increased by $165.5 million during
fiscal 1998 due to the inclusion of $147.9 million of capital lease and
financing obligations of hills and $25.9 million of new capital leases.
 
     we have not paid any cash dividends during the past three fiscal years. the
payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our bank credit
facility.
 
capital expenditures
 
     capital expenditures for fiscal 1998 were $77.5 million, including
$25.9 million in new point-of-sale information equipment and related software
acquired pursuant to capital leases. the capital expenditure amount also
included, among other items, the opening of six new stores, the remodeling of 22
stores and the upgrading of certain management information systems. capital
expenditures for fiscal 1997 were $32.9 million and included, among other items,
the opening of nine new stores, the remodeling of nine stores and the upgrading
of certain management information systems, including the installation of new
point-of-sale systems in ten stores.
 
     capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $210.0 million for
fiscal 1999, primarily for the remodeling and conversion of 150 of the acquired
hills stores and nine former caldor stores. we expect to finance conversion
expenditures, including but not limited to, distribution center equipment
purchases, store fixtures and equipment and remodeling expenses, through
internally generated funds and borrowings under our bank credit facility. we
expect to finance a substantial portion of new point-of-sale systems through
capital leases. land, buildings and improvements are financed principally
through long-term leases.
 
seasonality
 
     our business is seasonal in nature, with a large portion of our net sales
occurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the
back-to-school and christmas shopping seasons. net sales are highest in the last
fiscal quarter (31.7% in fiscal 1998). the demand for working capital is
heaviest in may, and from august through november, when sufficient merchandise
must be purchased for the spring, back-to-school and christmas seasons,
respectively.
 
year 2000 readiness
 
     in operating our business, we are dependent on information technology and
process control systems that employ computers as well as embedded
microprocessors. we also depend on the proper functioning of the business
systems of third parties, particularly the more than 3,200 vendors from whom we
purchase the merchandise sold in our stores. many computer systems and
microprocessors can only process dates in which the year is represented by two
digits. as a result, some of these systems and processors may interpret "00"
incorrectly as the year 1900 instead of the year 2000, in which event they could
malfunction or become inoperable after december 31, 1999. systems and processors
that can properly recognize the year 2000 are referred to as "year 2000
compliant."
 
     as previously reported, we initiated a comprehensive program to prepare our
computer systems and applications for the year 2000. we have spent approximately
$3.8 million on this program through the end of fiscal 1998 and expect that full
implementation of the program will involve an additional $2.0 million to
$2.5 million, including expenditures for software and consulting services.
additionally, we estimate the allocated costs of our internal system development
staff who are implementing our year 2000 initiatives to be $3.5 million to
$4.0 million over the life of the project.

forward-looking statements
 
     the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and
elsewhere in this annual report that are not historical facts are
"forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. those statements include all discussions of
strategy as well as statements that contain such forward-looking expressions as
"believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "will," "should," or
"anticipates" or the negative thereof. in addition, from time to time, we or our
representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in
writing. furthermore, forward-looking statements may be included in our filings
with the securities and exchange commission as well as in press releases or oral
presentations made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive
officers.
 
     we caution you to bear in mind that forward-looking statements, by their
very nature, involve assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and
uncertainties. although we believe that the assumptions and expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, no
assurance can be given that those assumptions or expectations will prove to have
been correct. important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
     o deteriorating general economic conditions in the united states,
       particularly in the regions in which our stores are located;
 
     o decreased consumer spending, particularly among those consumers who
       comprise our primary customer base;
 
     o increased competition from other discount retailers, including major
       national chains, as well as from merchandise offerings on the internet;
 
     o severe adverse weather conditions during the winter months, particularly
       during the peak christmas holiday shopping season; and
 
     o failure of our suppliers to make their computer systems year 2000
       compliant in a timely manner.
 
     all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
these factors and the cautionary statements contained herein.
 
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
 
     we have exposure to interest rate volatility primarily relating to interest
rate changes applicable to revolving loans under our bank credit facility. these
loans bear interest at rates which vary with changes in (i) the london interbank
offered rate (libor) or (ii) a rate of interest announced publicly by bank of
america nt&amp;sa.;
 
     we do not speculate on the future direction of interest rates. as of
january 30, 1999, approximately $44.9 million of our debt bore interest at
variable rates. we believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near
term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows would not be significant.
 
item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
 
     see index to consolidated financial statements.
 
item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure.
 
     none.

(a) dollar value realized represents the number of options exercised multiplied
    by the difference between the market price of ames' common stock at date of
    exercise and the strike price of the options.
 
(b) includes 125,000 sars granted to j. ettore pursuant to an employment
    contract which is more fully described below. the dollar value of the sars
    in the table is calculated by multiplying the number of sars times the
    difference between (i) $2.00 (representing the exercise price of certain
    rights surrendered by mr. ettore in connection with the ettore agreement (as
    defined)) and (ii) $28.741, the average closing price of a share of common
    stock during the twenty trading days prior to january 30, 1999.
 
     all sars granted to members of management in connection with the ames'
emergence from chapter 11 protection in 1992 expired as of december 30, 1997.
during fiscal 1997, a total of 166,683 such sars were exercised.
 
long-term incentive plan awards
 
     there were 215,000 shares of restricted stock (35,000 pursuant to the 1995
incentive plan and 180,000 pursuant to the 1998 incentive plan as defined
previously) awarded to certain executive officers during fiscal year 1998.
 
     ames' 1995 incentive plan was approved by the stockholders on may 24, 1995.
the purpose of the 1995 incentive plan is to promote ames' long term success by
affording certain officers with an opportunity to acquire an ownership interest
in ames in order to incentivize such persons and to align their financial
interests with ames' stockholders. pursuant to the 1995 incentive plan, ames may
make awards ("awards") of an aggregate of up to 500,000 shares of common stock
that are subject to restrictions on transfer thereof ("restricted stock") and a
cash payment (a "cash payment") in an amount up to 50% of the fair market value
(as defined in the 1995 incentive plan) of the restricted stock determined as
of, and paid on, the third anniversary of the date of grant (the "vesting
date"). the cash payment is intended to defray a substantial portion of an award
recipient's federal and state income tax liabilities on the award (including the
cash payment) in order to allow the recipient to receive the restricted stock
substantially free and clear on the vesting date.
 
     officers eligible for awards under the 1995 incentive plan are the chief
executive officer, each executive vice president and each senior vice president.
the compensation committee administers the 1995 incentive plan. during 1998,
there were 35,000 shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to the 1995
incentive plan. as of january 30, 1999, 295,000 shares in the aggregate had
vested, and 60,000 shares remain unvested.
 
     the 1998 incentive plan (as defined above) was approved by the stockholders
in may 1998. the purpose of the 1998 incentive plan is intended to provide
incentives which will attract, retain and motivate highly competent persons as
key employees by providing them opportunities to acquire shares of common stock
or receive
 
                                       25
<page>
monetary payments based on the value of such shares. the 1998 incentive plan
makes available for awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive plan) an aggregate
amount of 1,800,000 shares of common stock. the maximum number of shares of
common stock with respect to which awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive
plan) may be granted (or measured) to any individual participant may not exceed
300,000. common stock awarded under the 1998 incentive plan vests 50% on the
fourth anniversary from the date of grant and 50% on the fifth anniversary.
there is no cash payment to be made related to the vesting of the grant.
 
     officers eligible for awards under the 1998 incentive plan are such key
employees of ames as the board of directors in its sole discretion determines to
be significantly responsible for the success, future growth and profitability of
ames. during 1998, there were 195,000 shares of restricted stock issued pursuant
to the 1998 incentive plan and as of january 30, 1999, all 180,000 shares remain
unvested.
 
annual incentive compensation plan
 
     ames has an annual incentive compensation plan (the "annual bonus plan")
that is subject to annual review by the compensation committee and the board of
directors. the annual bonus plan provides annual incentive cash bonuses based on
the achievement of ames' financial goals for the year (as well as customer
service goals for store and field management). pursuant to the annual bonus
plan, bonuses for fiscal year 1998 will be paid in may 1999. participants must
be active ames employees at the time the bonus payments are made to earn a
bonus.
 
retirement and savings plan
 
     ames has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the
"retirement and savings plan") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. employees who have
reached the age of 21 are eligible to participate after one year of service
provided they have completed at least 1,000 hours of service in a 12-month
period. for each participant's contribution (up to a maximum of 5% of such
participant's total compensation), ames contributes to the retirement and
savings plan an amount equal to 50% of such contribution. a participant may
contribute to the plan from 1% to 18% of annual compensation on a pre-tax or
after-tax basis, or a combination of both. participants who terminate their
employment with ames are entitled to receive the full amount of their
contributions and, depending on the length of the participant's service to ames,
a portion of ames' matching contributions.
 
     the following table sets forth as to the named executive officers (those
listed in the summary compensation table), and all other officers and employees
of ames as a group, the aggregate matching contributions by ames under the
retirement and savings plan during fiscal year 1998:

retirement plan
 
     ames has an unfunded retirement plan for officers/directors (the
"retirement plan"). it provides that every person who is employed by ames when
he or she retires, dies or becomes disabled and who serves as both a full-time
officer and a director of ames and has completed five years of service, not
necessarily consecutive, in both of these capacities, is eligible for benefits
under the retirement plan.
 
     benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon termination of
employment due to retirement, death or disability. the annual benefit is equal
to two-thirds of the participant's average annual base salary during the
five-year period of highest compensation preceding such termination of
employment. the maximum annual benefit under the retirement plan is $100,000,
reduced by an amount equal to certain of such participant's annual
 
                                       26
<page>
social security benefits. each participant in the retirement plan is entitled to
benefits for a period of 10 years. upon the earlier death of the participant, at
ames' option, the future payments as scheduled or the then present value of all
unpaid benefits would be paid to the participant's estate. joseph ettore,
current president, chief executive officer and director, potentially qualifies
for benefits under this plan. as of january 30, 1999, mr. ettore had completed
approximately fifty-six months of credited service as a full-time officer and
director of ames. no payments were made under this plan in fiscal year 1998.
 
compensation of directors
 
     ames' directors who are not full-time ames employees (the "outside
directors") receive a base fee of $40,000 in director's fees ($80,000 per year
for the chairman) for six regular meetings and $3,000 for each additional board
meeting and are reimbursed for their expenses. directors are also compensated at
the rate of $10,000 per year for up to four meetings for each committee on which
they serve and $2,500 for each additional committee meeting. for fiscal year
1998, board activity and meetings exceeded the anticipated number of regular
meetings. the directors, however, determined to limit their compensation for
fiscal year 1998 to the base fee, and to forego any additional compensation for
additional meetings.
 
     pursuant to ames' 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan, as amended
(the "amended non-employee plan"), directors who are not full-time ames
employees are granted options to purchase common stock of ames on the date of
each annual meeting of stockholders of the company. commencing with the may 27,
1998 annual meeting, the number of shares granted on the date of each annual
meeting is 7,500. all options terminate ten years after date of grant. the
exercise prices of the options are equal to the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. the options become exercisable in full six months
after date of grant. as of january 30, 1999, messrs. basile, buxbaum, cohen and
pearlman had been granted 22,500 options each and mr. felner and ms. shahon had
been granted 15,000 options each.

     set forth below are descriptions of the material features of the employment
contracts between ames and joseph r. ettore, president and chief executive
officer, denis t. lemire, executive vice president and chief operating officer,
and rolando de aguiar, executive vice president and chief financial and

     ames is party to an employment agreement with joseph ettore dated june 1,
1998 and expiring may 31, 2004 (the "ettore agreement"), pursuant to which
mr. ettore serves as president and chief executive officer of ames. under the
ettore agreement, mr. ettore is entitled to a base salary of $1,000,000 per year

key employee continuity benefit plan
 
     ames has a key employee continuity benefit plan (the "continuity plan")

of ames. if the employment of any participant in the continuity plan is
terminated by the company other than for death, disability, cause (as defined in

participant will receive a lump sum cash severance payment. the severance
payment is 2.99 times base compensation for the president and executive vice
presidents, 2 times base compensation for senior vice presidents and selected
vice presidents, and 1 times base compensation for other vice presidents. base
compensation is defined generally as the sum of the participant's annual base
compensation in effect immediately prior to the participant's termination plus
one-third of the value of the cash and stock bonuses paid to the participant
during the 36 months ending on the date of termination. for purposes of the
continuity plan, a change of control includes, but is not limited to, the
acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
company's outstanding voting securities or the failure of the individuals who
constituted the board of directors at the beginning of any period of 12
consecutive months to continue to constitute a majority of the board during such
period.

                    report of independent public accountants
 
to the stockholders and board of directors of
ames department stores, inc.:
 
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ames department
stores, inc. (a delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of january 30, 1999
and january 31, 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended
january 30, 1999, and the fifty-three weeks ended january 31, 1998 and the
fifty-two weeks ended january 25, 1997. these consolidated financial statements
and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the company's
management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
we conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ames department stores, inc.
and subsidiaries as of january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended january 30,
1999, and the fifty-three weeks ended january 31, 1998 and the fifty-two weeks
ended january 25, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
 
our audits were performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. the schedule listed in the index to
consolidated financial statements is presented for the purpose of complying with
the securities and exchange commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. this schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

                   notes to consolidated financial statements
 
1. summary of significant accounting policies:
 
  (a) nature of operations:
 
     ames department stores, inc. (a delaware corporation) and its subsidiaries
(collectively, "ames" or the "company") are retail merchandisers. as of
march 1, 1999, ames operated 453 discount department stores in 19 states in the
northeast, midwest and mid-atlantic regions, as well as the district of
columbia. the stores are located in rural communities, small cities and the
suburbs of larger metropolitan areas.
 
     in 1999, the company will remodel and convert substantially all of the
acquired hills stores to ames stores. the remodeling and conversion process is
being conducted in three stages, each stage involving approximately one-third of
the hills stores. the first stage is scheduled to be completed in late april
1999; the second and third stages are scheduled to be completed in july 1999 and
september 1999, respectively.
 
  (b) basis of presentation:
 
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
 
  (c) change in fiscal year:
 
     the company changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to
the saturday nearest january 31, effective with the fiscal year ended january
30, 1999. this change was made so that the company's fiscal year would coincide
with the fiscal year of most other publicly-held retailers. there was no impact
on the current year period as a result of this change. the fiscal year ended
january 30, 1999 ("fiscal 1998" or "1998") included 52 weeks. the fiscal year
ended january 31, 1998 ("fiscal 1997" or "1997") included 53 weeks. the fiscal
year ended january 25, 1997 ("fiscal 1996" or "1996") included 52 weeks.
 
  (d) principles of consolidation:
 
     the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ames and its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. all intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
 
  (e) cash and short-term investments:
 
     ames considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash and short-term investments.
 
  (f) inventory valuation:
 
     inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
(fifo) method, or market and include the capitalization of transportation and
distribution center costs.
 
  (g) fixed assets:
 
     land and buildings, fixtures and equipment, and leasehold improvements are
recorded at cost. major replacements and betterments are capitalized.
maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred. the cost of assets
sold or retired and the related amounts of accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal, with the resulting gain or
loss included in earnings.

            notes to consolidated financial statements--(continued)
 
1. summary of significant accounting policies:--(continued)
  (h) intangible assets:
 
     beneficial lease rights represent the excess of fair market value over
contract value of certain of the leases acquired in the hills acquisition (as
defined in note 2 below). goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair
value of net tangible assets acquired at the date of the hills acquisition. see
note 2 for further explanation.
 
  (i) depreciation and amortization:
 
     land and buildings and fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. property
under capital leases and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms.
 
     beneficial lease rights are being amortized over the terms of the related
leases (which average approximately 25 years). goodwill is being amortized over
a 25-year period.
 
     the excess of revalued net assets over equity under fresh-start reporting
is being amortized over a 10-year period. the amount recorded as a credit to
depreciation and amortization was $6.2 million in each of fiscal 1998, fiscal
1997 and fiscal 1996.
 
     the unfavorable lease liability is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over the applicable lease terms.
 
     depreciation and amortization includes adjustments recorded pursuant to the
application of statement of financial accounting standards no. 121, "accounting
for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed
of." the company did not record an impairment loss during fiscal 1998. during
fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, the company recorded impairment losses of
$1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
 
  (j) deferred charges:
 
     pursuant to sop 98-5, "reporting on the costs of start-up activities,"
expenses related to new store openings are expensed when incurred. see
note 18--recently issued accounting standards.
 
     debt transaction costs and related issue expenses are deferred and
amortized over the term of the associated debt. lease acquisition and related
costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease.
 
  (k) income taxes:
 
     ames files a consolidated federal income tax return. in december 1992, ames
adopted statement of financial accounting standards no. 109, "accounting for
income taxes" ("sfas no. 109") under fresh-start reporting. under this method,
any deferred income taxes recorded are provided for at currently effective
statutory rates on the differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for
tax and financial reporting purposes. if recorded, deferred income taxes are
classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based upon the
expected future period in which such deferred income taxes are anticipated to
reverse.
 
  (l) self-insurance reserves:
 
     the company is self-insured for workers' compensation, general liability,
property and casualty, and accident and health insurance claims, subject to
certain limitations. the company has insurance coverage for losses that may
occur above certain levels. the company determines its liability for claims
based on the circumstances of each individual claim and estimates its liability
for claims incurred but not yet reported based on historical experience. as of
january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, ames had established self-insurance
reserves of $66.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively. the long-term portion
of these reserves is classified as part of other long-term liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. these reserves are subject to changes in estimates
as claims are settled or continue to remain outstanding.

  (m) leased department and other income:
 
     ames has an agreement with an independent contractor that allows the
independent contractor to operate shoe departments within the ames stores. ames
receives a percentage of the sales under the agreement.
 
  (n) earnings per common share:
 
     in february 1997 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no. 128, "earnings per share" ("sfas
no. 128"). under sfas no. 128, the presentation of primary and fully diluted
earnings per share was replaced by basic and diluted earnings per share. the
company adopted the provisions of sfas no. 128 effective january 31, 1998, and
has restated all periods presented.
 
     net income per common share for each of fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
determined by using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during that fiscal year. common equivalent shares represented
the assumed exercise of the company's outstanding series b and series c warrants
and stock options.
 
  (o) stock-based compensation:
 
     statement of financial accounting standards no. 123, "accounting for
stock-based compensation," ("sfas no. 123") encourages, but does not require
companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans at fair value. the company has chosen to continue to account for
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
accounting principles board opinion no. 25, "accounting for stock issued to
employees," ("apb opinion no. 25") and related interpretations. accordingly,
compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the company's stock at the date of grant over the
exercise price of the options.
 
2. acquisition and agency agreement:
 
  acquisition of hills stores company
 
     on december 31, 1998, hsc acquisition corp. ("hsc"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of the company, acquired 81.3% of the outstanding common stock and
74.4% of the outstanding convertible preferred stock of hills stores company
("hills") pursuant to a tender offer made in implementation of an agreement and
plan of merger (the "merger agreement"), dated as of november 12, 1998, by and
among the company, hsc and hills. at the closing of that acquisition (the "hills
acquisition"), a total of $114.5 million was disbursed as follows:
 
     o $12.7 million to hills common shareholders for 81.3% of the shares
       outstanding
 
     o $1.0 million to holders of hills series a convertible preferred stock for
       74.4% of the shares outstanding
 
     o $100.8 million to holders of hills 12 1/2% senior notes for 73.9% of the
       notes outstanding
 
     the amount paid to the holders of the hills senior notes represented a
discount of approximately 30% from the face value of the acquired notes.
 
     holders of the hills shares and senior notes who tendered their securities
for purchase also received a deferred contingent right to receive a further cash
payment out of, and based upon, hills ultimate net recovery, if any, in a
lawsuit brought by hills in september 1995 against certain of its former
directors. the outcome of this lawsuit, whether favorable or unfavorable, would
result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition.

2. acquisition and agency agreement:--(continued)
     subsequent to the acquisition date, hills was merged with hsc. upon the
effectiveness of that merger, the company paid $3.3 million to retire the
remaining common and preferred shares of hills. the company also incurred
professional fees, accounting, legal and other costs of approximately
$12.2 million in connection with the acquisition. these costs have been
accounted for as part of the purchase price. the hills acquisition was funded by
cash provided by operations and borrowings under the company's 1998 credit
agreement. (see note 6.)
 
     the acquisition has been recorded under the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the results of operations of hills for the period from
december 31, 1998 through january 30, 1999 are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. the aggregate purchase price of $130 million
has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a
preliminary determination of respective fair market values at the date of
acquisition and is subject to adjustment. the fair value of tangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed was $477 million and $637 million,
respectively. the balance of the purchase price, $290 million, was recorded as
two components: an excess of cost over net assets acquired (goodwill) of
$231 million, which is being amortized over 25 years on a straight-line basis,
and beneficial lease rights of $59 million, which is being amortized over the
life of the respective leases (which average approximately 25 years).
 
     in connection with the acquisition, management determined that certain
previously capitalized technology costs, intangible assets, property and
equipment and other assets of hills had no future use to the company. as a
result, these assets have been effectively written-off in connection with the
acquisition, and have been reflected at "zero value" (or adjusted estimated fair
value where appropriate) in the above summary of fair value of assets assumed.
in addition, due to the agency agreement discussed below, certain fair value
adjustments were recorded to inventory and related accounts.
 
     at the time of the acquisition, hills operated 155 discount department
stores. in 1999, the company will remodel and convert 150 of the hills stores to
ames stores. the five remaining hills stores will be closed because they are in
locations that are either competitive with other ames stores or are
underperforming. the remodeling and conversion process will be conducted in
three stages, each stage involving approximately one third of the hills stores.
the first stage is scheduled to be completed in late april 1999; the second and
third stages are scheduled to be completed in july 1999, and september 1999,
respectively.
 
  agency agreement overview
 
     concurrent with the hills acquisition, the company entered into a
transition and agency agreement (the "agency agreement") with gordon brothers
retail partners, llc and the nassi group, llc (collectively the "agent"), which
provides that the agent serve for a period of time to operate all of the
acquired hills stores and to conduct inventory liquidation sales at each of
those stores prior to its scheduled remodeling or final closure. accordingly,
the agent is managing the sale of the inventory acquired in the hills
acquisition as well as certain other inventory identified in the agency
agreement (collectively the "merchandise").
 
     the agency agreement is based upon the company providing hills merchandise
having a minimum initial retail value or selling price of $625.0 million for the
agent to manage, including both store merchandise and distribution center
merchandise, on-hand at the time of the acquisition, as well as committed
on-order merchandise. the agency agreement entitles the company to receive out
of the sale proceeds a minimum amount (the "guaranteed amount") equal to 40% of
the initial retail value or initial ticketed selling price of the merchandise
(the "guaranteed return"). an additional payment may be made to the company if
proceeds of sale exceed a target percentage of the initial retail value. the
agency agreement further entitles the company to reimbursement of certain store
operating expenses (e.g., payroll, rent, advertising, etc.) out of the sale
proceeds during the agency period.

            notes to consolidated financial statements--(continued)
 
2. acquisition and agency agreement:--(continued)
     the agent will be paid a fee (the "agency fee") for its services pursuant
to the agency agreement. the agency fee will be an amount equal to the proceeds
from the sales of hills merchandise less a deduction for the reimbursement of
store operating expenses and the guaranteed return.
 
     as a result of the above terms and provisions, the company valued the
acquired hills inventory at an amount equal to the guaranteed return, which
resulted in an opening balance sheet adjustment to reduce inventory by
approximately $131.0 million. in addition, the company has recorded a purchase
commitment valuation liability of approximately $37.5 million with respect to
the prior purchase commitments of hills for merchandise ordered prior to the
hills acquisition which the company is legally required to honor. the recording
of this valuation liability will result in an inventory valuation for these
committed purchases that approximates 40% of initial retail value.
 
  agency agreement accounting
 
     as discussed earlier, the results of operations of hills since the date of
the hills acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. for the month of january 1999, and for the duration of the
agency agreement, the following accounting treatment has been, and will be,
applied to recognize the results of the hills stores prior to their conversion
to ames stores during fiscal 1999. hills net sales will be recorded as "hills
net sales" and represent net sales achieved by the hills stores prior to their
conversion to ames stores. "hills cost of merchandise sold" represents the cost
of merchandise sold in connection with the hills net sales as adjusted for the
guaranteed return amount mentioned above. "hills operating expenses and agency
fees " include the following: the associated store expenses incurred while
operating the hills stores prior to their conversion to ames stores, which are
reimbursable to the company out of the proceeds of hills merchandise sales per
the agency agreement; the agency fee due to the agent for the period presented;
and other expenses (e.g., non-store payroll, non-store rent, etc.) associated
with supporting the hills stores prior to their conversion to ames stores, which
are not reimbursable under the agency agreement.
 
     the agency fee amount was determined based upon the hills sales results for
the period, less the guaranteed return and reimbursable hills store expenses, as
specified in the agency agreement. because the company is entitled to a
guaranteed return and reimbursement of hills store expenses during the term of
the agency agreement, it is anticipated that the company will realize "agency
income" during the latter stages of the agency agreement after the sale proceeds
from the liquidation of hills merchandise decrease as a percentage of the
initial retail value. as a result, any agency fee calculated on an interim basis
may not be indicative of the total fee to be remitted to the agent. the agency
fee will only be determined after a final accounting for all revenues and
expenses earned/incurred during the entire agency period. the final accounting
will be completed during the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

merchandise for hills represents the merchandise sold during january 1999
adjusted for the guaranteed return (see note 2). the selling, general and
administrative expenses for hills include reimbursable store operating expenses
of $25.4 million; agency fee of $21.7 million; and other non-reimbursable
expenses of $4.8 million. the depreciation and amortization expense for hills
includes the depreciation and amortization of the revalued fixed assets, the

the credit agreement
 
     on december 31, 1998, in connection with the hills acquisition (see note
2), certain of the company's subsidiaries entered into an agreement (the "credit
agreement") with a syndicate of other banks and financial institutions for whom
bank of america nt&amp;sa; is serving as agent. the credit agreement provides for a
secured revolving credit facility of up to $650 million, with a sublimit of
$150 million for letters of credit.
 
     the credit agreement replaced a $320 million secured revolving credit
facility (the 1996 credit agreement).
 
     the credit agreement is in effect until june 30, 2002 and is secured by
substantially all of the assets of the company. the interest rate per annum on
borrowings under the credit agreement is equal to the base rate (as defined in
the credit agreement) plus 0.625% (subject to downward adjustments).
alternatively, the interest rate per annum may be equal to libor rate (as
defined in the credit agreement) plus 2.25% (subject to downward adjustments).
 
     fees required under the credit agreement include: (a) monthly commitment
fees on the unused portion of the facility; (b) an initial closing fee and
(c) an initial agency fee and annual collateral management fees for the account
of the agent.
 
     for fiscal 1998, the weighted average interest rate on the company's
revolving credit facilities was 7.57% and the peak borrowing level was $148.3
million. as of january 30, 1999, borrowings under the credit agreement were
$44.9 million (at a weighted average interest rate per annum of 7.57%) and $3.3
million and $11.0 million was outstanding in trade and standby letters of
credit, respectively.
 
     the amount of borrowing under the credit agreement may not exceed the sum
of (a) an amount equal to 70% or 75% of certain inventory in the possession of
the company (depending on the period of year as provided for in the credit
agreement) plus (b) an amount equal to 50% of certain inventory not in the
possession of the company, but covered by any outstanding letter of credit. the
agent, in addition, reserves the right to adjust the total available to be
borrowed by establishing reserves, making determinations of eligible inventory,
revising standards of eligibility or decreasing from time to time the
percentages set forth above.
 
     the financial covenants under the credit agreement are limited to: minimum
borrowing availability; for the quarter ended april 2000, minimum ebitda (as
defined below) and, thereafter, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as
defined in the credit agreement). ebitda is defined as: income before
(a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense or benefit, (c) depreciation and
amortization expense, stock appreciation rights accruals, certain restructuring
charges and other non-cash charges.

senior notes due 2003
 
     the 12.5% senior notes due 2003 (the "senior notes") were, at the time of
the hills acquisition (see note 2), an unsecured obligation of hills.
 
     pursuant to the merger agreement, the company, in november 1998, made a
tender offer to purchase at a stated discount all of hills' outstanding senior
notes, which at the time totaled $195.0 million. upon expiration of the tender
offer, the company on december 31, 1998, paid cash of $100.8 million (including
the related accrued interest) to acquire senior notes having a face value of
$144.1 million. senior notes with a face value balance of $50.9 million remain
outstanding.
 
     the tendering holders of the senior notes, representing 73.9% of the then
outstanding senior notes, consented to certain modifications to the indenture
governing the senior notes. included among the modifications were the deletion
of the sections covering reporting requirements, debt and lien incurrence and
asset sales and additional subsidiary guarantees.

the authorized capital stock of ames consisted of 43,000,000 shares divided into
two classes: (i) 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $.01 per
share (the "preferred stock"), and (ii) 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $.01 per share (the "common stock").
 
     there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of january 30, 1999
and january 31, 1998. there were 23,921,545 and 22,506,108 shares of common
stock outstanding as of january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998, respectively.
 
     the board of directors of the company may authorize the issuance of one or
more series of preferred stock and specify for each such series the voting
powers (but no greater than one vote per share), designations, preferences, and
relative, participating, optional, redemption, conversion, exchange or other
special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series, and
the number of shares in each series.
 
     holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all
matters to be voted upon by stockholders and are entitled to receive dividends
when, as and if declared by the board of directors. dividends cannot be declared
under the terms of the credit agreement.
 
     the common stock does not have any preemptive right or subscription or
redemption privilege. the common stock also does not have cumulative voting
rights, which means the holder or holders of more than half of the shares voting
for the election of directors can elect all the directors then being elected.
all of the shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.
 
treasury stock
 
     in august 1998, the company's board of directors approved a stock
repurchase program and authorized management to purchase up to 1.5 million
shares of common stock. during fiscal 1998, the company acquired 79,495 shares
of its common stock. during the course of the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 1998, the company suspended further purchases due to the pending
acquisition of hills.
 
warrants
 
     an aggregate of 200,000 series b warrants were issued on december 30, 1992.
each such warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at
any time from june 30, 1993 through december 30, 2000. the exercise price is
$5.92 per share. during fiscal 1998, 100,000 series b warrants were exercised.
 
     an aggregate of 2,120,000 series c warrants were issued on december 30,
1992. each such warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common
stock at any time from june 30, 1993 through january 31, 1999. the exercise
price was $1.11 per share. during fiscal 1998, 723,867 series c warrants were
exercised. on january 31, 1999, 8,635 series c warrants expired.
 
     the exercise prices of the above warrants are subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of certain events, including, among other things, the payment of
a stock dividend, a merger or consolidation and the issuance for consideration
of rights, options or warrants (other than rights to purchase common stock
issued to shareholders generally) to acquire common stock.
 
     a holder of any of the warrants described above will not be entitled to any
rights as a stockholder of the company, including, without limitation, the right
to vote the underlying shares of common stock, until the holder has exercised
the warrants.

stock purchase rights agreement
 
     on november 30, 1994, the company adopted a stock purchase rights agreement
(the "rights agreement"). under the terms of the rights agreement, one purchase
right ("right"), with an exercise price of $14.00, is attached to each share of
common stock outstanding as of, or issued subsequent to, november 30, 1994 but
prior to the occurrence of certain events (as more fully described in the rights
agreement). the rights become exercisable in the event that a person or group
(an "acquiring person") either acquires 15% or more of the company's outstanding
voting stock or announces an intention to acquire 20% or more of such stock.
once exercisable, each right will, depending on the circumstances, entitle a
holder, other than an acquiring person, to purchase shares of either the company
or an acquiring company having a market value equal to twice the exercise price.
the rights agreement was adopted to assure that all of the company's
stockholders receive full value for their investment in the event of stock
accumulation by an acquiring person. unless previously redeemed by the company,
the rights will expire on november 29, 2004.
 
9. stock options:
 
     the 1998 stock incentive plan (the "1998 incentive plan"), approved by
stockholders in may 1998, provides for the grant of awards (as defined in the
1998 incentive plan) and makes available for awards an aggregate amount of
1,800,000 shares of common stock. the maximum number of shares of common stock
with respect to which awards (as defined in the 1998 incentive plan) may be
granted (or measured) to any individual may not exceed 300,000. with respect to
such awards under the 1998 incentive plan, the company may grant awards in the
form of options to purchase common stock provided that the exercise price shall
not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date
the stock option is granted.
 
     pursuant to the 1994 management stock option plan (the "1994 option plan")
approved by stockholders in june 1994, the company may grant options with
respect to an aggregate of up to 1,700,000 shares of common stock, with no
individual optionee to receive in excess of 200,000 shares of common stock upon
exercise of options granted. the exercise prices of the options are equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date the options are granted. the
options become exercisable over one to five years and terminate after five to
ten years from the grant date.
 
     pursuant to the 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan (the
"non-employee plan") approved by stockholders in may 1995, the company may grant
to non-employee directors options to purchase up to an aggregate of 200,000
shares of common stock. the exercise prices of the options are equal to the fair
market value of the common stock on the date the options are granted. the
options become exercisable in full six months after date of grant and terminate
ten years after date of grant. effective on the date of each annual meeting of
stockholders of the company commencing with the 1996 annual meeting, each
non-employee director of the company then in office was granted an option to
purchase 2,500 shares, with the date of grant to be the date of such meeting. at
the 1998 annual meeting, the stockholders approved an amendment to the non-
employee plan increasing the number of options granted on the date of each
annual meeting from 2,500 to 7,500 effective as of the may 27, 1998 grant. as of

interest rate equal to u.s. treasury securities with a maturity equal to the
expected life of the option (weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, 6.4% and
6.4% for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively) and an expected life from date of

10. income taxes:
 
     the company adopted sfas no. 109 in conjunction with the adoption of
fresh-start reporting in december 1992. under sfas no. 109, deferred income
taxes are recognized by applying the enacted statutory tax rates in future years
to the changes in "cumulative temporary differences" (the differences between
financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities).
 
     as a consequence of the adoption of fresh-start reporting and sfas no. 109,
any tax benefits realized for tax purposes after the consummation date for
pre-consummation cumulative temporary differences, as well as for the
pre-consummation net operating loss carryovers, are reported as additions to
paid-in capital (see consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity)
rather than as reductions in the tax provisions in the consolidated statements
of operations. tax benefits or liabilities realized for book purposes after the
consummation date will be segregated from the pre-consummation deferred tax
assets. the utilization of post-consummation deferred tax assets may reduce
future income tax provisions. such income tax provisions have no impact on the
company's taxes payable or cash flows.
 
     on december 31, 1998, the company completed its acquisition of
approximately 81.3% of the outstanding common stock of hills. accordingly, the
tax data presented for fiscal 1998 reflects the tax effects of the acquisition,
including the temporary differences created by the application of purchase
accounting.
 
     for fiscal 1998, the company recorded an income tax provision of $18.8
million, of which approximately $0.5 million will be paid in cash. for fiscal
1997, the company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $19.1
million of which $0.3 million was paid in cash.
 
     the provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

     the company has reduced its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets
by $95.0 million, after consideration for recording additional valuation
allowances to offset net deferred tax assets recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition, during fiscal 1998, which reflects the company's expectation
of utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets
in the foreseeable future (2 years)

after considering an adjustment for unusual activity and potential
contingencies. the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a
corresponding addition to paid-in-capital.
 
     a significant portion of the ames deferred tax assets (including those
created by the hills acquisition) continue to require a valuation allowance
because of the uncertainty of future recognition of such deductions. in
subsequent periods, ames may further reduce the valuation allowances, provided
that the possibility of utilization of the deferred tax asset is more likely
than not to occur, as defined by sfas no. 109. any such reduction in the
valuation allowance in the near future will result in a corresponding addition
to paid-in-capital for the ames component of the deferred asset and to goodwill
for the hills components.
 
     the company has treated "pre-emergence net operating losses" (qualified
losses incurred prior to the consummation date) under section 382(1) (5) of the
internal revenue code ("irc"). there is approximately $409.0 million of
pre-emergence and approximately $35.0 million of post-emergence net operating
losses currently available as carryovers without any annual limitation. these
losses will expire between 2007 and 2012. additionally, the company has filed a
$20 million refund claim under section 172(f) of the internal revenue code. the
claim represents a 10-year carryback of qualified expenses and is currently
under review by the internal revenue service ("irs"). the claim, if successful,
will reduce net operating losses by approximately $47.0 million.
 
     in addition, ames has targeted jobs tax credit carryovers of approximately
$7.0 million, which will expire in 2007, and alternative minimum tax credit
carryovers of approximately $4.0 million, which have no expiration period.
federal net operating loss carryovers for fiscal years subsequent to
january 27, 1990 are subject to future adjustments, if any, by the irs.
 
     as a result of the acquisition of the common stock of the hills stores
company, ames has succeeded to the tax attributes of hills, including net
operating losses of $178.0 million and general business credits of
$11.0 million. these tax attributes expire between 2000 and 2013. ames also has
succeeded to minimum tax credit carryforwards of $5.0 million, which do not
expire. these tax attributes are significantly limited under internal revenue
code sections 382 and 383, respectively, as a result of the change in control
caused by the hills acquisition and the resulting deferred tax asset has been
reduced accordingly.
 
     ames and hills have substantial potential state net operating loss
carryovers. it is difficult, however, to quantify the utilizable amounts of such
state operating losses because of the uncertainty related to the mix of future
profits in specific states.
 
     the irs has completed its audit of hills for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 fiscal
years. the final outcome of this examination will not have an adverse effect on
the company. hills has filed a claim for a refund of federal taxes for the
subsequent years. the refund claim, if successful, is approximately
$7.0 million. if the company receives this refund amount, there will be a
corresponding adjustment to reduce goodwill recorded in connection with the
hills acquisition.
 
11. benefit and compensation plans:
 
retirement and savings plans
 
  ames plan
 
     ames has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the "ames
retirement and savings plan") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, for employees who, after one
year of service, have reached the age of 21 and have completed at least 1,000
hours of service in a 12-month period. for each participant's contribution (up
to a maximum of 5% of such participant's total compensation), the company
contributes to the retirement and savings plan an amount equal to 50% of

such contribution. ames funds all administrative costs incurred by the plan.
ames' expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately $3.3 million,
$3.0 million and $2.9 million, in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
  hills plan
 
     hills has a defined contribution retirement and savings plan (the "hills
retirement and savings plan ") that is qualified under sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, for full-time employees
who are eligible to participate at the first of each calendar quarter and for
all regular and part-time employees who, after one year of service have
completed at least 1,000 hours of service in a 12-month period. for each
participant's contribution (after one year of service) hills contributes 100% of
the first 2% from service years 1-3 and 100% of the first 4% for service years 4
and over. hills funds all administrative costs incurred by the plan with certain
exceptions. the expense associated with this plan was $0.3 million for january
1999.
 
     the company intends to merge the two retirement and savings plans after
further review and consideration of how to structure the merged plan and how to
transition to the merged plan.
 
retirement plan
 
     ames has an unfunded retirement plan for officers/directors (the
"retirement plan"). it provides that every person who is employed by ames when
he or she retires, dies or becomes disabled and who serves as both a full-time
officer and a director of ames and has completed five years of service, not
necessarily consecutive, in both of these capacities, is eligible for benefits
under the retirement plan.
 
     the maximum annual benefit under the retirement plan is $100,000, reduced
by certain of each participant's annual social security benefits. each
participant in the retirement plan is entitled to benefits for a period of 10
years. the company has a reserve established for potential payments under the
retirement plan. no payments were made under this plan during the periods
presented.
 
the g.c. murphy company life insurance plan
 
     the g.c. murphy company life insurance plan (the "gcm plan") granted a flat
dollar amount (defined benefit) of group term life insurance at no cost to
certain retired employees. this plan excludes g.c. murphy co. employees who
retired from ames after january 31, 1986. the amount of coverage varies by
retiree, is payable only upon death, and has no loan or cash value. during 1997,
the company entered into a contract with an insurance company which effectively
transferred to the insurance company all future liabilities associated with the
gcm plan in exchange for fixed annual payments over ten years.
 
annual incentive compensation plan
 
     the company has an annual incentive compensation plan (the "annual bonus
plan") that is subject to annual review by the board of directors. the annual
bonus plan provides annual incentive cash bonuses based on the achievement of
the company's financial goals for the year (and customer service goals for store
and field management). there are approximately 1,500 members of management
eligible under the plan. bonus expense recorded under the plan was $8.3 million,
$6.3 million, and $7.9 million for fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

restricted stock awards
 
  1995 long term incentive plan
 
     pursuant to the company's 1995 long term incentive plan (the "1995
incentive plan"), approved by the stockholders in may, 1995, the company may
make awards of an aggregate of up to 500,000 shares of common stock and cash
payment in an amount up to 50% of the fair market value (as defined in the 1995
incentive plan) of the common stock awarded, determined as of and paid on the
vesting date. each award under the 1995 incentive plan vests in full on the
third anniversary of the date of grant of such award. awards may be made to the
chief executive officer, any executive vice president and any senior vice
president of the company. other than for death or disability, awards which have
not yet vested are forfeited upon the termination of the employment of the
executive.
 
     as of january 30, 1999, awards aggregating to 355,000 shares of common
stock had been made to certain executives of the company, 60,000 of which remain
unvested.
 
  1998 incentive plan
 
     pursuant to the company's 1998 incentive plan (as defined in note 9),
awards aggregating 195,000 shares of common stock were made to certain
executives during fiscal 1998. fifty percent (50%) of each stock award under the
1998 incentive plan vests on the fourth anniversary from the date of grant and
50% on the fifth anniversary. there is no cash payment to be made relative to
the vesting of the grant.
 
     the shares for the outstanding awards under both the 1995 incentive plan
and the 1998 incentive plan have been issued and are being held in custody by
the company on behalf of the grantees thereof. a portion of the estimated market
value of the awards, including the cash, has been accrued as compensation
expense as of january 30, 1999. the company recorded as compensation expense for
the 1995 incentive plan and the 1998 incentive plan $1.9 million, $2.0 million,
and $1.1 million during 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
stock appreciation rights
 
     all stock appreciation rights ("sars") granted to certain members of
management in connection with the company's emergence from chapter 11 protection
in 1992 expired as of december 30, 1997. during fiscal 1997, a total of 166,683
sars were exercised. the company recorded an expense of $0.1 million and $0.8
million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. in june 1998, the company extended the
employment agreement with joseph r. ettore, chief executive officer and
president. in connection therewith, mr. ettore was granted 125,000 sars which
entitle mr. ettore to receive in cash upon exercise the excess of (a) the
average closing price of a share of common  stock during the twenty trading days
prior to the exercise date over (b) $2.00 (representing the exercise price of
certain rights surrendered by mr. ettore). mr. ettore's sars are exercisable on
or after may 31, 1999.
 
income continuation plan
 
     certain officers of ames participate in an income continuation plan
("icp"), which guarantees up to one year's salary in the event of termination
other than for cause. as of january 30, 1999, the company had no obligations
under the icp.
 
key employee continuity benefit plan
 
     ames has a key employee continuity benefit plan (the "continuity plan")
that covers all officers, vice president and above, and certain other employees
of ames. if the employment of any participant in the continuity plan is
terminated, other than for death, disability, cause (as defined in the
continuity plan) or by the participant other than for good reason (as defined in
the continuity plan), within 18 months after a change of control of ames, the
participant will receive a lump sum cash severance payment. the severance
payment is 2.99 times base compensation for the president and executive vice
presidents, two times base compensation for

  wage and hour litigation
 
     since march 1995, the company has been named as a defendant in several
class action complaints which allege that the company was obligated to pay
overtime to its hardlines and softlines assistant store managers. the company
has consistently stated its belief that these positions are appropriately
designated as exempt positions not calling for overtime pay. the company has
settled several of these cases. these settlements have not required any change
in the company's treatment of the status of its hardlines and softlines
assistant managers. the company is vigorously defending one remaining case which
it does not believe represents a material exposure.

14. fair values of financial instruments:
 
     the financial accounting standards board requires disclosure of the fair
value of financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards
no. 107, "disclosures about fair value of financial instruments". the following
methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating the fair value
disclosures for its financial instruments.
 
     the company's financial instruments as of january 30, 1999 and january 31,
1998 were cash and short-term investments, long-term debt, and the series c
warrants, which expired on january 30, 1999. for cash and short-term
investments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets
approximated fair values. for long-term debt obligations, the fair values were
estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis (based upon the company's
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements). the
fair value of the series c warrants was based on the market trading price at
year-end times the number of such warrants that were outstanding.
 
     the carrying amounts and fair values of the company's financial instruments
at january 30, 1999 and january 31, 1998 were as follows:

     in december 1996, the company terminated a prior credit agreement (note 6)
and recorded a non-cash extraordinary charge of $1.4 million, net of tax benefit
of $0.6 million, for the write-off of deferred financing costs.
 
18. recently issued accounting pronouncements
 
     in april 1998, aicpa issued sop 98-5, "reporting on the costs of start-up
activities" which requires start-up costs, as defined, to be expensed as
incurred. pursuant to sop 98-5, previously capitalized start-up costs are
required to be written-off as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. sop 98-5 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after december 15, 1998.

18. recently issued accounting pronouncements--(continued)
     the company elected early adoption of sop 98-5 during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1998, retroactively effective to the first quarter of fiscal 1998. the
company's previous policy was to expense all store pre-opening costs in the year
of opening, amortizing them from the date of opening through the balance of the
fiscal year. no cumulative effect has been recorded on the company's
consolidated statement of operations. however, the quarterly financial data
presented in note 19 has been restated to properly reflect the effect of the sop
in each of the presented quarterly results.
 
     in february 1998, the financial accounting standards board released
statement no. 132, "employers' disclosures about pensions and other
postretirement benefits" ("sfas no. 132"). this statement, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 1997, modifies and expands
disclosure requirements. adoption of sfas no. 132 will have no impact on the
company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

     these unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative
purposes only. they do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations
which actually would have resulted had the hills acquisition been consummated at
the beginning of fiscal 1997 or fiscal 1998, or of future results of operations
of the consolidated entities.
 
     the above pro forma net income and earnings per common share amounts for
the year ended january 30, 1999 reflect the previously recorded write-down of
hills deferred tax assets of approximately $49.6 million (which is net of a
reversal of approximately $5.9 million of accrued tax liabilities). excluding
the write-down of the hills deferred tax assets recorded as of october 31, 1998,
pro forma net loss and loss per common share would have been $5.3 million and
$0.23, respectively for the year ended january 30, 1999.
 
21. subsequent events:
 
     on march 4, 1999, the company entered into an agreement with caldor
corporation to purchase seven of its stores in connecticut, one store in
massachusetts and a 649,000 square foot distribution center in westfield,
massachusetts, for a cash purchase price of $40.0 million. under the terms of
the agreement, the company will assume caldor's leases for the eight stores and
the distribution center and will acquire all of the store fixtures and all
racking, sorting systems and materials handling equipment in the distribution
center.
 
     on march 26, 1999, the united states bankruptcy court for the southern
district of new york approved the company's right to purchase the leases for the
stores and the distribution center.
 
     on march 26, 1999, the company entered into an agreement with caldor
corporation for the purchase of an additional store in massachusetts for a cash
purchase price of $2.7 million. this agreement is subject to competing bids and 
the approval of the bankruptcy court.
