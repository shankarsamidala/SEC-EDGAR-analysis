1.     basis of presentation:
       ----------------------
              in  the  opinion  of  management,   the   accompanying   unaudited
       consolidated  condensed  financial  statements of ames department stores,
       inc. (a delaware  corporation) and subsidiaries  (collectively  "ames" or
       the "company")  contain all adjustments  (consisting of normal  recurring
       adjustments)   necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  of  such  financial
       statements  for  the  interim  periods.  due  to the  seasonality  of the
       company's  operations,  the  results of its  operations  for the  interim
       period ended august 1, 1998 may not be  indicative  of total  results for
       the full year.  certain  information  and footnote  disclosures  normally
       included in financial  statements  prepared in accordance  with generally
       accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
       the rules and  regulations  promulgated  by the  securities  and exchange
       commission (the "sec"). certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
       to  conform  to  the   presentation   used  for  the  current  year.  the
       consolidated  condensed  balance  sheet at january 31, 1998 was  obtained
       from audited  financial  statements  previously filed with the sec in the
       company's  latest  form 10-k.  the  accompanying  unaudited  consolidated
       condensed  financial  statements  should be read in conjunction  with the
       financial  statements and notes thereto  included in the company's latest
       form 10-k.

2.     net income per common share:
       ----------------------------
              net income per share was  determined  using the  weighted  average
       number of  common  shares  outstanding.  190,723  warrants were converted
       and 74,210  options  were  exercised  during  the quarter ended august 1,
       1998.  during  the  quarter  ended  july 26, 1997,  139,789 warrants were
       converted and 254,960 options were exercised.

3.     inventories:
       ------------
              inventories  are valued at the lower of cost or market.  effective
       october 25, 1997, the company changed from the retail last-in,  first-out
       (lifo) method of accounting for  inventories  to the first-in,  first-out
       (fifo) method and restated all prior  periods for the change.  the change
       had no impact on the historical results of operations of the company.

4.     debt:
       ----- 
              on december 27, 1996,  the company  entered into an agreement with
       bankamerica business credit,  inc., as agent, two financial  institutions
       as co-agents  (together with the agent,  the  "agents"),  and a syndicate
       consisting of five other banks and financial institutions,  for a secured
       revolving credit facility of up to $320 million,  with a sublimit of $100
       million  for  letters  of credit  and a $20  million  term  loan  portion
       available for capital expenditures (the "credit agreement").

              the credit  agreement is in effect until june 30, 2000, is secured
       by  substantially  all of the assets of the  company,  and  requires  the
       company to meet  certain  financial  covenants.  in  addition,  each year
       outstanding  borrowings  under the  credit  agreement  may not exceed any
       balance  due  under  the term  loan  portion  plus up to $20  million  in
       revolver loans for a consecutive  30-day period between november 15th and
       february 15th of the following  year.  the company is in compliance  with
       the financial covenants through the quarter ended august 1, 1998.

<page>

              as of august 1, 1998, borrowings of $70.5 million were outstanding
       under the  credit  agreement.  in  addition,  $19.5 and $8.1  million  of
       standby and trade letters of credit, respectively, were outstanding under
       the  credit  agreement.  the  weighted  average  interest  rates  on  the
       borrowings  for the  thirteen and  twenty-six  weeks ended august 1, 1998
       were 8.0% and 8.1% respectively.  the peak borrowing level through august
       1, 1998 was $70.5 million.

              the  amount of  borrowing  under the  credit  agreement  shall not
       exceed the sum of (i) an amount equal to 60% of inventory  not covered by
       any  outstanding  letter  of credit  plus (ii) an amount  equal to 50% of
       inventory covered by any outstanding  letter of credit. in addition,  the
       credit  agreement  provides  for the  potential  establishment  of  other
       reserves contingent upon the company's financial performance. each agent,
       in  addition,  reserves  the right to adjust  the total  available  to be
       borrowed by  establishing  reserves,  making  determinations  of eligible
       inventory,  revising  standards of eligibility or decreasing from time to
       time the percentages set forth above. reference can be made to the latest
       form  10-k for  further  descriptions  of the  credit  agreement  and for
       descriptions of the company's other obligations not discussed herein.

 5.    stock options:
       --------------
              the company has three stock option plans (the "option plans"): the
       1994 management  stock option plan, the 1998  management  stock incentive
       plan and the 1994 non-employee directors stock option plan.

              in  october  1995,   sfas  no.  123  "accounting  for  stock-based
       compensation"  was issued.  sfas no. 123  establishes  a fair-value based
       method of accounting for  stock-based  compensation;  however,  it allows
       entities to continue  accounting  for employee  stock-based  compensation
       under the intrinsic  value method  prescribed  by  accounting  principles
       board opinion no. 25,  "accounting  for stock  issued to employees".  the
       company elected to account for the  option  plans  under apb  opinion no.
       25,  under which no compensation cost has been recognized, and adopt sfas
       no. 123 through disclosure.

              if the company had elected to recognize  compensation cost for the
       option  plans based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under
       those plans,  consistent with the method  prescribed by sfas no. 123, net
       income and net income per diluted  common  share would have  approximated
       the pro forma amounts indicated below:

                                 for the thirteen           for the twenty-six

              the fair  value of stock options used to compute the pro forma net
       income and the net income per common share  (diluted)  is  the  estimated
       present value at grant date using the black-scholes option-pricing  model
       with  the  following  weighted  average  assumptions:  no dividend yield,
       expected option volatilities,  a risk-free interest rate  equal  to  u.s.
       treasury  securities with a maturity equal to the expected  life  of  the
       option  and  an  expected life from date of grant until option expiration
       date.

6.     income taxes:
       -------------
              the company's  estimated annual effective income tax rate for each
       year was  applied to the income  before  income  taxes for each period to
       compute a non-cash  income tax  provision.  the income tax provisions are
       included as  additions  to paid-in  capital on the balance  sheet for all
       periods presented.

 7.    litigation:
       -----------
              reference  can be made to the  latest  form  10-k  (note 12 to the
       consolidated  financial  statements) for various litigation involving the
       company,  for which there were no material  changes since the filing date
       of the form 10-k, except as follows:

              with regard to the second  complaint (the austin matter),  on july
       15, 1998, the court approved a class action settlement (the "settlement")
       which had been reached by the  parties.  notices of the  settlement  were
       sent to all potential  class members on august 19, 1998.  the  settlement
       provides that in exchange for a release of all claims against the company
       each class member who elects to opt-in to the  settlement  will receive a
       benefit,  either cash or discounts on future  purchases at an ames store,
       based on the  number of days  worked  for the  company  during  the class
       period.  individuals  who wish to opt-in to the settlement  must sign and
       return a consent  and  release  form on or before  october 3,  1998.  the
       maximum cost of the  settlement to the company cannot exceed $1.5 million
       in cash if all  participants  elect cash or $4.5  million in discounts on
       purchases if all participants  elect  discounts.  the company believes it
       has adequately reserved for the settlement.

              with  regard  to  the  fifth  complaint  (the  moschelle  matter),
       pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the parties will jointly move to
       dismiss this action  without  prejudice to the rights of any class member
       who does not elect to opt-in to the settlement by the stated deadline.

    the following  discussion and analysis is based on the results of operations
for the  thirteen and  twenty-six  weeks ended august 1, 1998 and july 26, 1997.
during the first half of 1998,  three (3) stores  were opened and two (2) stores
were closed. in the comparable  prior-year period, seven (7) stores were opened,
thirteen  (13) stores were closed and the company  determined  that it would not
re-open a store previously closed as a result of flooding.

       net sales for the  thirteen  weeks ended august 1, 1998  increased  $32.7
million  or 6.5%  from the  prior-year's  second  quarter  due  primarily  to an
increase  of 4.0% in  comparable-store  sales and the net  addition of three (3)
stores.  net sales for the twenty-six weeks ended august 1, 1998 increased $99.2
million or 10.6% as compared  to the same  prior-year  period.  comparable-store
sales increased by 8.1% for the first twenty-six weeks.

       gross margin for the second quarter increased $10.0 million, but remained
unchanged as a percentage of net sales,  as compared with the quarter ended july
26, 1997.  gross margin for the twenty-six  weeks ended august 1, 1998 increased
$29.6  million,  or 0.1% as a  percentage  of net  sales  compared  to the  same
prior-year  period.  the  improvement  in  year-to-date  gross  margin rates was
primarily attributable to lower markdowns.

       selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirteen weeks ended
august 1, 1998 increased $7.9 million,  but decreased 0.3% from the prior-year's
second  quarter due  primarily to favorable performance in advertising and lower
compensation related expenses. for the twenty-six week period, selling,  general
and  administrative  expenses  increased $22.8 million,  but decreased 0.5% as a
percentage  of net  sales as  compared  to the same  prior-year  period  due  to
favorable performances in store and advertising expenses.

       depreciation and amortization  expense  increased by $0.9 million or 0.1%
as a  percentage  of net sales,  in the  thirteen  weeks  ended  august 1, 1998,
compared to the same prior-year period. for the twenty-six weeks ended august 1,
1998,  depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $1.8  million,  but  remained
unchanged  as a  percentage  of net  sales,  compared  with the same  prior-year
period.  the adoption of fresh-start  reporting as of december 26, 1992 resulted
in the write-off of all of the company's  non-current  assets at that date,  and
therefore  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  results  only from  capital
additions after that date.

       the  amortization  of the excess of revalued net assets over equity under
fresh-start  reporting  remained  the same in the current  periods  presented as
compared  to the prior  year.  the  company is  amortizing  this  amount  over a
ten-year period.

       interest and debt expense,  net of interest income,  was essentially flat
in the thirteen  weeks ended august 1, 1998 as compared to the period ended july
26,  1997.  for the  twenty-six  weeks ended  august 1, 1998,  interest and debt
expense  decreased  $0.4 million or 0.1% as a percentage of net sales,  compared
with the same prior-year period.  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction
in short-term interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding balances
under the credit  agreement  (from $55.6 to $36.4 million  during the twenty-six
week period) partially offset by increased capital lease interest expense.

       the company's  estimated  annual  effective income tax rate for each year
was  applied  to the income  before  income  taxes for each  period to compute a
non-cash  income tax  provision.  the  income tax  provisions  are  included  as
additions to paid-in capital on the balance sheet for all periods presented.

liquidity and capital resources
- -------------------------------
        on  december  27,  1996,  the company  entered  into an  agreement  with
bankamerica  business  credit,  inc., as agent,  two financial  institutions  as
co-agents (together with the agent, the "agents"), and a syndicate consisting of
five other banks and  financial  institutions,  for a secured  revolving  credit
facility of up to $320  million,  with a sublimit of $100 million for letters of
credit (the "credit agreement").

       the credit agreement is in effect until june 30, 2000. the company was in
compliance  with the  financial  covenants of the credit  agreement  through the
quarter ended august 1, 1998.  reference can be made to note 4 of this quarterly
report  and  the  latest  form  10-k  for  further  descriptions  of the  credit
agreement.

       merchandise  inventories,  increased  $58.3 million from july 26, 1997 to
august 1, 1998 due primarily to planned  increases.  the increase in inventories
of $78.3  million  from january 31, 1998 to august 1, 1998 was  principally  the
result of a normal seasonal build-up of inventories and planned increases.

       trade  accounts  payable  increased  $22.7  million from july 26, 1997 to
august 1, 1998 primarily due to planned  merchandise  inventory  increases.  the
decrease of $4.8 million from january 31, 1998 to august 1, 1998 was principally
the result of the seasonal dating in effect as of january 31, 1998.

       capital  expenditures  totaled $37.5 million  (including $14.9 million in
capital leases for store automation  (pos) systems)  for  the  twenty-six  weeks
ended  august 1,  1998  and  for  the  balance  of  the year are estimated to be
approximately  $47 million.  the  company  adjusts  its  plans for  making  such
expenditures  depending  on the  amount of internally generated funds.

       the net  operating  loss  carryovers  remaining  after  fiscal year 1997,
subject to any  limitations  pursuant to internal  revenue code sec. 382, should
offset income on which taxes would otherwise be payable in future years.
     
       the company believes that available cash and expected cash flows from the
current  fiscal  year's  operations  and  beyond,  and the  availability  of its
financing  facilities,  will enable the company to fund its  expected  needs for
working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements.

accounting pronouncements
- -------------------------
    in april 1998, the accounting  standards  executive committee (acsec) issued
statement  of  position  (sop)  98-5,   "reporting  on  the  costs  of  start-up
activities".  the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15,
1998 although earlier adoption is permitted. the sop will require that the costs
of start-up  activities be expensed as incurred.  the company currently expenses
costs associated with the opening of new  stores in  the  year they are  opened.
these costs are  carried  as  prepaid  expenses  prior to the opening of the new
stores.  the company expects to adopt this  statement as of january 30, 1999 and
does not anticipate the adoption will materially affect the company's results of
operations or financial  position.

year 2000
- ---------
       as previously reported, the company has initiated a comprehensive program
to  prepare  its  computer  systems  and  applications  for the year  2000.  the
assessment  phase of the  company's  remediation  program  is  complete  and the
systems  development  and testing stages are in progress.  the company has spent
approximately $2.6 million on its year 2000 initiatives to date and expects that
full  implementation  of the program will involve an additional $2 to $3 million
over the next two years for  conversion  and  testing of  systems.  these  costs
include  incremental  expenses  such  software,  outside  consulting  and  other
expenses.  additionally, the company has allocated systems development staff  to
year 2000 initiatives and estimates the non-incremental costs to  be  $3  to  $4
million over the life of the project.

      the  company  has  formally  communicated  with  all  of its  vendors  and
suppliers  to  determine  the extent to which the company may be  vulnerable  to
those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues.  the first
phase, which included sending year 2000 surveys and questionnaires,  is complete
and the response evaluation phase is currently in progress.  the company has not
had  sufficient  response  from vendors to provide an estimate of the  potential
impact of  non-compliance  on the part of such vendors.  management is currently
developing  contingency  plans which include,  but are not limited to,  securing
alternative  vendors who are year 2000 compliant,  developing manual merchandise
ordering processes,  and evaluating alternative merchandise  assortments.  it is
too early to determine to what  extent, if any,  these  contingency  plans  will
have to be implemented

       although  the company  expects to be year 2000  compliant by mid-1999 and
does not expect to be  materially  impacted by the  external  environment,  such
future  events  cannot  be known  with  certainty.  furthermore,  the  company's
estimates  of  future  remediation  costs  and  completion  dates  are  based on
presently  available  information  and may be updated as additional  information
becomes available.

were closed. in the comparable  prior-year period, seven (7) stores were opened,
thirteen  (13) stores were closed and the company  determined  that it would not
re-open a store previously closed as a result of flooding.

       net sales for the  thirteen  weeks ended august 1, 1998  increased  $32.7
million  or 6.5%  from the  prior-year's  second  quarter  due  primarily  to an
increase  of 4.0% in  comparable-store  sales and the net  addition of three (3)
stores.  net sales for the twenty-six weeks ended august 1, 1998 increased $99.2
million or 10.6% as compared  to the same  prior-year  period.  comparable-store
sales increased by 8.1% for the first twenty-six weeks.

       gross margin for the second quarter increased $10.0 million, but remained
unchanged as a percentage of net sales,  as compared with the quarter ended july
26, 1997.  gross margin for the twenty-six  weeks ended august 1, 1998 increased
$29.6  million,  or 0.1% as a  percentage  of net  sales  compared  to the  same
prior-year  period.  the  improvement  in  year-to-date  gross  margin rates was
primarily attributable to lower markdowns.

       selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirteen weeks ended
august 1, 1998 increased $7.9 million,  but decreased 0.3% from the prior-year's
second  quarter due  primarily to favorable performance in advertising and lower
compensation related expenses. for the twenty-six week period, selling,  general
and  administrative  expenses  increased $22.8 million,  but decreased 0.5% as a
percentage  of net  sales as  compared  to the same  prior-year  period  due  to
favorable performances in store and advertising expenses.

       depreciation and amortization  expense  increased by $0.9 million or 0.1%
as a  percentage  of net sales,  in the  thirteen  weeks  ended  august 1, 1998,
compared to the same prior-year period. for the twenty-six weeks ended august 1,
1998,  depreciation  and  amortization  increased  $1.8  million,  but  remained
unchanged  as a  percentage  of net  sales,  compared  with the same  prior-year
period.  the adoption of fresh-start  reporting as of december 26, 1992 resulted
in the write-off of all of the company's  non-current  assets at that date,  and
therefore  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  results  only from  capital
additions after that date.

       the  amortization  of the excess of revalued net assets over equity under
fresh-start  reporting  remained  the same in the current  periods  presented as
compared  to the prior  year.  the  company is  amortizing  this  amount  over a
ten-year period.

       interest and debt expense,  net of interest income,  was essentially flat
in the thirteen  weeks ended august 1, 1998 as compared to the period ended july
26,  1997.  for the  twenty-six  weeks ended  august 1, 1998,  interest and debt
expense  decreased  $0.4 million or 0.1% as a percentage of net sales,  compared
with the same prior-year period.  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction
in short-term interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding balances
under the credit  agreement  (from $55.6 to $36.4 million  during the twenty-six
week period) partially offset by increased capital lease interest expense.

       the company's  estimated  annual  effective income tax rate for each year
was  applied  to the income  before  income  taxes for each  period to compute a
non-cash  income tax  provision.  the  income tax  provisions  are  included  as
additions to paid-in capital on the balance sheet for all periods presented.

liquidity and capital resources
- -------------------------------
        on  december  27,  1996,  the company  entered  into an  agreement  with
bankamerica  business  credit,  inc., as agent,  two financial  institutions  as
co-agents (together with the agent, the "agents"), and a syndicate consisting of
five other banks and  financial  institutions,  for a secured  revolving  credit
facility of up to $320  million,  with a sublimit of $100 million for letters of
credit (the "credit agreement").

       the credit agreement is in effect until june 30, 2000. the company was in
compliance  with the  financial  covenants of the credit  agreement  through the
quarter ended august 1, 1998.  reference can be made to note 4 of this quarterly
report  and  the  latest  form  10-k  for  further  descriptions  of the  credit
agreement.

       merchandise  inventories,  increased  $58.3 million from july 26, 1997 to
august 1, 1998 due primarily to planned  increases.  the increase in inventories
of $78.3  million  from january 31, 1998 to august 1, 1998 was  principally  the
result of a normal seasonal build-up of inventories and planned increases.

       trade  accounts  payable  increased  $22.7  million from july 26, 1997 to
august 1, 1998 primarily due to planned  merchandise  inventory  increases.  the
decrease of $4.8 million from january 31, 1998 to august 1, 1998 was principally
the result of the seasonal dating in effect as of january 31, 1998.

       capital  expenditures  totaled $37.5 million  (including $14.9 million in
capital leases for store automation  (pos) systems)  for  the  twenty-six  weeks
ended  august 1,  1998  and  for  the  balance  of  the year are estimated to be
approximately  $47 million.  the  company  adjusts  its  plans for  making  such
expenditures  depending  on the  amount of internally generated funds.

       the net  operating  loss  carryovers  remaining  after  fiscal year 1997,
subject to any  limitations  pursuant to internal  revenue code sec. 382, should
offset income on which taxes would otherwise be payable in future years.
     
       the company believes that available cash and expected cash flows from the
current  fiscal  year's  operations  and  beyond,  and the  availability  of its
financing  facilities,  will enable the company to fund its  expected  needs for
working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements.

accounting pronouncements
- -------------------------
    in april 1998, the accounting  standards  executive committee (acsec) issued
statement  of  position  (sop)  98-5,   "reporting  on  the  costs  of  start-up
activities".  the sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15,
1998 although earlier adoption is permitted. the sop will require that the costs
of start-up  activities be expensed as incurred.  the company currently expenses
costs associated with the opening of new  stores in  the  year they are  opened.
these costs are  carried  as  prepaid  expenses  prior to the opening of the new
stores.  the company expects to adopt this  statement as of january 30, 1999 and
does not anticipate the adoption will materially affect the company's results of
operations or financial  position.

year 2000
- ---------
       as previously reported, the company has initiated a comprehensive program
to  prepare  its  computer  systems  and  applications  for the year  2000.  the
assessment  phase of the  company's  remediation  program  is  complete  and the
systems  development  and testing stages are in progress.  the company has spent
approximately $2.6 million on its year 2000 initiatives to date and expects that
full  implementation  of the program will involve an additional $2 to $3 million
over the next two years for  conversion  and  testing of  systems.  these  costs
include  incremental  expenses  such  software,  outside  consulting  and  other
expenses.  additionally, the company has allocated systems development staff  to
year 2000 initiatives and estimates the non-incremental costs to  be  $3  to  $4
million over the life of the project.

      the  company  has  formally  communicated  with  all  of its  vendors  and
suppliers  to  determine  the extent to which the company may be  vulnerable  to
those third parties' failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues.  the first
phase, which included sending year 2000 surveys and questionnaires,  is complete
and the response evaluation phase is currently in progress.  the company has not
had  sufficient  response  from vendors to provide an estimate of the  potential
impact of  non-compliance  on the part of such vendors.  management is currently
developing  contingency  plans which include,  but are not limited to,  securing
alternative  vendors who are year 2000 compliant,  developing manual merchandise
ordering processes,  and evaluating alternative merchandise  assortments.  it is
too early to determine to what  extent, if any,  these  contingency  plans  will
have to be implemented

       although  the company  expects to be year 2000  compliant by mid-1999 and
does not expect to be  materially  impacted by the  external  environment,  such
future  events  cannot  be known  with  certainty.  furthermore,  the  company's
estimates  of  future  remediation  costs  and  completion  dates  are  based on
presently  available  information  and may be updated as additional  information
becomes available.
