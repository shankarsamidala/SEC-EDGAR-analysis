item 7(a). quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk sensitive instruments and positions

the risk inherent in the company's market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. the
sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse
changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional
actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes. actual
results may differ. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for
accounting policies and additional information.

aircraft fuel the company's earnings are affected by changes in the price and
availability of aircraft fuel. in order to provide a measure of control over
price and supply, the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
facilities to support its flight operations. the company also manages the price
risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing swap and option contracts. market risk is
estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the december 31, 1999 and
1998 cost per gallon of fuel. based on projected 2000 fuel usage, such an
increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately
$125 million in 2000, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december 31,
1999. comparatively, based on projected 1999 fuel usage, such an increase would
have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $73
million in 1999, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december 31, 1998.
the change in market risk is due primarily to the increase in fuel prices. as of
december 31, 1999, the company had hedged approximately 48 percent of its 2000
fuel requirements and approximately 10 percent of its 2001 fuel requirements,
compared to approximately 48 percent of its 1999 fuel requirements and 19
percent of its 2000 fuel requirements hedged at december 31, 1998.

foreign currency the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations on the u.s. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
revenues and expenses. the company's largest exposure comes from the japanese
yen, british pound, canadian dollar, euro and various latin and south american
currencies. the company uses options to hedge a portion of its anticipated
foreign currency-denominated net cash flows. the result of a uniform 10 percent
strengthening in the value of the u.s. dollar from december 31, 1999 and 1998
levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign
currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
approximately $39 million and $22 million for the years ending december 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively, net of hedge instruments outstanding at december 31,
1999 and 1998, due to the company's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its
foreign-denominated expenses. this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
projected 2000 and 1999 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of
december 31, 1999 and 1998. furthermore, this calculation assumes that each
exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar.

interest the company's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates
due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
short-term investments and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
instruments. the company has variable-rate debt instruments representing
approximately 21 percent and six percent of its total long-term debt,
respectively, at december 31, 1999 and 1998, and interest rate swaps on notional
amounts of approximately $696 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, at
december 31, 1999 and 1998. if interest rates average 10 percent more in 2000
than they did at december 31, 1999, the company's interest expense would
increase by approximately $10 million and interest income from cash and
short-term investments would increase by approximately $11 million. in
comparison, at december 31, 1998, the company estimated that if interest rates
averaged 10 percent more in 1999 than they did at december 31, 1998, the
company's interest expense would have increased by approximately $6 million and
interest income from cash and short-term investments would have increased by
approximately $8 million. these amounts are determined by considering the impact
of the hypothetical interest rates on the company's variable-rate long-term
debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash and short-term investment balances
at december 31, 1999 and 1998.

       market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
interest rates, and amounts to approximately $156 million and $96 million as of
december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the fair values of the company's
long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future
cash flows based on the company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types
of borrowing arrangements.

investments the company is subject to market risk related to its ownership of,
excluding the depository certificates held on behalf of sabre, approximately 1.2
million and 1.4 million depository certificates convertible, subject to certain
restrictions, into the common stock of equant, as of december 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. the estimated fair value of these depository certificates was
approximately $136 million and $100 million as of december 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, based upon the market value of equant common stock.

       in addition, the company holds investments in certain other entities,
primarily foreign airlines, which are subject to market risk. however, the
impact of such market risk on earnings is not significant due to the
immateriality of the carrying value and the geographically diverse nature of
these holdings.

notes to consolidated financial statements

1. summary of accounting policies

basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of amr corporation (amr or the company), its wholly owned subsidiaries,
including its principal subsidiary american airlines, inc. (american), and its
majority-owned subsidiaries, including sabre holdings corporation (sabre). all
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. the results of
operations, cash flows and net assets for sabre, amr services, amr combs and
teleservice resources have been reflected in the consolidated financial
statements as discontinued operations. unless specifically indicated otherwise,
the information in the footnotes relates to the continuing operations of amr.
all share and per share amounts reflect the stock split on june 9, 1998, where
appropriate. certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform
with the 1999 presentation.

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those
estimates.

inventories spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment are
carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when incurred in
operations. allowances for obsolescence are provided, over the estimated useful
life of the related aircraft and engines, for spare parts expected to be on hand
at the date aircraft are retired from service, plus allowances for spare parts
currently identified as excess. these allowances are based on management
estimates, which are subject to change.

equipment and property the provision for depreciation of operating equipment and
property is computed on the straight-line method applied to each unit of
property, except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are
depreciated on a group basis. the depreciable lives used for the principal
depreciable asset classifications are:

       (1) approximate final aircraft retirement date.

       residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and
assemblies are generally five to 10 percent, except when a guaranteed residual
value or other agreements exist to better estimate the residual value.

       effective january 1, 1999, in order to more accurately reflect the
expected useful life of its aircraft, the company changed its estimate of the
depreciable lives of certain aircraft types from 20 to 25 years and increased
the residual value from five to 10 percent. it also established a 30-year life
for its new boeing 777 aircraft, first delivered in the first quarter of 1999.
as a result of this change, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by
approximately $158 million and net earnings were increased by approximately $99
million, or $0.63 per common share diluted, for the year ended december 31,
1999.

1. summary of accounting policies (continued)

       equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term
of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful
lives, and such amortization is included in depreciation and amortization. lease
terms vary but are generally 10 to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years
for other leased equipment and property.


maintenance and repair costs maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased
flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except engine
overhaul costs incurred by amr eagle holding corporation (amr eagle) and costs
incurred for maintenance and repair under power by the hour maintenance contract
agreements, which are accrued on the basis of hours flown.

intangible assets route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate lease
rights represent the purchase price attributable to route authorities, airport
take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired. these
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years for route
authorities, 25 years for airport take-off and landing slots, and the term of
the lease for airport gate leasehold rights.


passenger revenues passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component
of air traffic liability. revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the
time service is provided. however, due to various factors, including the complex
pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain
amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of
the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. actual
results could differ from those estimates.

advertising costs the company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
advertising expense was $206 million, $196 million and $181 million for the
years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

frequent flyer program the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel
awards is accrued when such award levels are reached. american sells mileage
credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer
program. the portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage credits is
deferred and recognized over a period approximating the period during which the
mileage credits are used.


statements of cash flows short-term investments, without regard to remaining

       all short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and

       at december 31, 1998, the company owned approximately 3.1 million
depository certificates convertible, subject to certain restrictions, into the
common stock of equant n.v. (equant), which completed an initial public offering
in july 1998. approximately 1.7 million of the certificates were held by the
company on behalf of sabre. as of december 31, 1998, the estimated fair value of
these depository certificates was approximately $210 million, of which
approximately $110 million was held by the company on behalf of sabre, based
upon the publicly traded market value of equant common stock. the carrying value
(cost basis) of the company's investment in the depository certificates as of
december 31, 1998 was de minimis.

       during 1999, the company acquired approximately 400,000 equant depository
certificates from other airlines. in addition, based upon a reallocation between
the owners of the certificates in july 1999, the company received an additional
2.6 million certificates. in connection with two secondary offerings by equant
in february and december 1999, the company sold approximately 2.7 million
depository certificates for a net gain of approximately $118 million, after
taxes and minority interest. of this amount, approximately $75 million is
included in miscellaneous - net and approximately $71 million, net of taxes and
minority interest, related to depository certificates held by the company on
behalf of sabre, is included in income from discontinued operations on the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, as of december
31, 1999, the company holds approximately 3.5 million depository certificates
with an estimated market value of approximately $395 million, of which
approximately 2.3 million depository certificates with an estimated market value
of approximately $259 million, are held by the company on behalf of sabre. the
carrying value of the company's investment in the depository certificates as of
december 31, 1999 was approximately $20 million.

       in december 1999, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
investment in the cumulative mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock
of canadian airlines international limited (canadian) for approximately $40
million, resulting in a gain of $40 million, which is included in miscellaneous
- - net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. in addition,
the company recognized a tax benefit of $67 million resulting from the tax loss
on the investment, representing the reversal of a deferred tax valuation
allowance since it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be
realized. the valuation allowance was established in 1996 when the investment
was written-off because, at that time, it was not more likely than not that the
tax benefit of the write-off would be realized.

3. commitments and contingencies

       at december 31, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire the
following aircraft: 81 boeing 737-800s, 26 boeing 777-200igws, 86 embraer
erj-135s, five embraer erj-145s and 25 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of all
aircraft extend through 2006. future payments for all aircraft, including
estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $2.2 billion in 2000,
$1.8 billion in 2001, $600 million in 2002 and an aggregate of approximately
$1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006. in addition to these commitments for
aircraft, the company's board of directors has authorized expenditures of
approximately $800 million over the next five years for modifications to
aircraft, renovations of -- and additions to -- airport and off-airport
facilities, and the acquisition of various other equipment and assets. amr
expects to spend approximately $470 million of this authorized amount in 2000.

       the miami international airport authority is currently remediating
various environmental conditions at the miami international airport (the
airport) and funding the remediation costs through landing fee revenues. future
costs of the remediation effort may be borne by carriers operating at the
airport, including american, through increased landing fees and/or other charges
since certain of the potentially responsible parties are no longer in business.
the future increase in landing fees and/or other charges may be material but
cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown
extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost
that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. in
addition, the company is subject to environmental issues at various other
airport and non-airport locations. management believes, after considering a
number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these environmental issues
is not expected to materially affect the company's consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. amounts recorded for
environmental issues are based on the company's current assessments of the
ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease as these
assessments change.

       in april 1995, american announced an agreement to sell 12 of its 19
mcdonnell douglas md-11 aircraft to federal express corporation (fedex). in
march 1998, the company exercised its option to sell its remaining seven md-11
aircraft to fedex. no significant gain or loss is expected to be recognized as a
result of these transactions. eight aircraft had been delivered as of december
31, 1999. the remaining 11 aircraft will be delivered between 2000 and 2002. the
carrying value of the 11 remaining aircraft american has committed to sell was
approximately $690 million as of december 31, 1999.

       amr and american have included event risk covenants in approximately $3.0
billion of indebtedness. these covenants permit the holders of such indebtedness
to receive a higher rate of return (between 75 and 650 basis points above the
stated rate) if a designated event, as defined, should occur and the credit
rating of such indebtedness is downgraded below certain levels. the company's
march 15, 2000 distribution of its ownership interest in sabre represents a
designated event under these debt covenants. however, the company has not
received indication that the credit rating on any such indebtedness will be
downgraded.

       special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain
municipalities, primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities
that are leased by american. in certain cases, the bond issue proceeds were
loaned to american and are included in long-term debt. certain bonds have rates
that are periodically reset and are remarketed by various agents. in certain
circumstances, american may be required to purchase up to $437 million of the
special facility revenue bonds prior to scheduled maturity, in which case
american has the right to resell the bonds or to use the bonds to offset its
lease or debt obligations. american may borrow the purchase price of these bonds
under standby letter of credit agreements. at american's option, these letters
of credit are secured by funds held by bond trustees and by approximately $489
million of short-term investments.

       at december 31, 1999, the company had 205 jet aircraft and 71 turboprop
aircraft under operating leases, and 79 jet aircraft and 61 turboprop aircraft
under capital leases. the aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates
based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for one to five years.
most aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term
at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the
defined lessor's cost of the aircraft or at a predetermined fixed amount.

       during 1996, american made prepayments on the cancelable operating leases
it had on 12 of its boeing 767-300 aircraft. upon the expiration of the amended
leases, american can purchase the aircraft for a nominal amount. as a result,
the aircraft were recorded as flight equipment under capital leases. during
1999, the company exercised its option to purchase two of the boeing 767-300
aircraft for a nominal fee. as such, these two aircraft were reclassified from
flight equipment under capital leases to owned flight equipment.

       rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.3 billion for 1999 and $1.1
billion for 1998 and 1997.

       maturities of long-term debt (including sinking fund requirements) for
the next five years are: 2000 - $302 million; 2001 - $516 million; 2002 - $150

       american has a $1.0 billion credit facility agreement that expires
december 19, 2001. at american's option, interest on the agreement can be
calculated on one of several different bases. for most borrowings, american
would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon the london interbank
offered rate (libor). at december 31, 1999, no borrowings were outstanding under
the agreement.

       certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets
having a net book value of approximately $2.7 billion. in addition, certain of
american's debt and credit facility agreements contain restrictive covenants,
including a minimum net worth requirement, which could limit american's ability
to pay dividends. at december 31, 1999, under the most restrictive provisions of
those debt and credit facility agreements, approximately $2.6 billion of the
retained earnings of american was available for payment of dividends to amr.

       cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $237
million, $277 million and $411 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

6. financial instruments and risk management

       as part of the company's risk management program, amr uses a variety of
financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fuel swap and option
contracts and currency exchange agreements. the company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

       notional amounts and credit exposures of derivatives

       the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments summarized in
the tables which follow do not represent amounts exchanged between the parties
and, therefore, are not a measure of the company's exposure resulting from its
use of derivatives. the amounts exchanged are calculated based on the notional
amounts and other terms of the instruments, which relate to interest rates,
exchange rates or other indices.

6. financial instruments and risk management (continued)

       the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any of
the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. the credit exposure related
to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts
with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of
master netting agreements. to manage credit risks, the company selects
counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
program and its relative market position with each counterparty. the company
also maintains industry-standard security agreements with the majority of its
counterparties which may require the company or the counterparty to post
collateral if the value of these instruments falls below certain mark-to-market
thresholds. as of december 31, 1999, no collateral was required under these
agreements, and the company does not expect to post collateral in the near
future.

       interest rate risk management

       american enters into interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert
a portion of its fixed-rate obligations to floating-rate obligations. these
agreements involve the exchange of amounts based on a floating interest rate for
amounts based on fixed interest rates over the life of the agreement without an
exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based. the
differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and
recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the obligation. the
related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is included in
current liabilities or assets. the fair values of the swap agreements are not
recognized in the financial statements. gains and losses on terminations of
interest rate swap agreements are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying
amount of the outstanding obligation and amortized as an adjustment to interest
expense related to the obligation over the remaining term of the original
contract life of the terminated swap agreement. in the event of the early
extinguishment of a designated obligation, any realized or unrealized gain or
loss from the swap would be recognized in income coincident with the
extinguishment.

       the following table indicates the notional amounts and fair values of the
company's interest rate swap agreements (in millions):

       fuel price risk management

       american enters into fuel swap and option contracts to protect against
increases in jet fuel prices. under the fuel swap agreements, american receives
or makes payments based on the difference between a fixed price and a variable
price for certain fuel commodities. under the fuel option agreements, american
pays a premium to cap prices at a fixed level. the changes in market value of
such agreements have a high correlation to the price changes of the fuel being
hedged. gains or losses on fuel hedging agreements are recognized as a component
of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is used. any premiums paid
to enter into option contracts are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized
to fuel expense over the respective contract periods. gains and losses on fuel
hedging agreements would be recognized immediately should the changes in the
market value of the agreements cease to have a high correlation to the price
changes of the fuel being hedged. at december 31, 1999, american had fuel
hedging agreements with broker-dealers on approximately two billion gallons of
fuel products, which represents approximately 48 percent of its expected 2000
fuel needs and approximately 10 percent of its expected 2001 fuel needs. the
fair value of the company's fuel hedging agreements at december 31, 1999,
representing the amount the company would receive to terminate the agreements,
totaled $232 million. at december 31, 1998, american had fuel hedging agreements
with broker-dealers on approximately two billion gallons of fuel products, which
represented approximately 48 percent of its expected 1999 fuel needs and
approximately 19 percent of its expected 2000 fuel needs. the fair value of the
company's fuel hedging agreements at december 31, 1998, representing the amount
the company would pay to terminate the agreements, totaled $108 million.

       foreign exchange risk management


       to hedge against the risk of future exchange rate fluctuations on a
portion of american's foreign cash flows, the company enters into various
currency put option agreements on a number of foreign currencies. the option
contracts are denominated in the same foreign currency in which the projected
foreign cash flows are expected to occur. these contracts are designated and
effective as hedges of probable quarterly foreign cash flows for various periods
through december 31, 2000, which otherwise would expose the company to foreign
currency risk. realized gains on the currency put option agreements are
recognized as a component of passenger revenues. at december 31, 1999 and 1998,
the notional amount related to these options totaled approximately $445 million
and $597 million, respectively, and the fair value, representing the amount amr
would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled approximately $14 million and
$10 million, respectively.

       the company has entered into japanese yen currency exchange agreements to
effectively convert certain yen-based lease obligations into dollar-based
obligations. changes in the value of the agreements due to exchange rate
fluctuations are offset by changes in the value of the yen-denominated lease
obligations translated at the current exchange rate. discounts or premiums are
accreted or amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the lives of the
underlying lease obligations. the related amounts due to or from counterparties
are included in other liabilities or other assets. the net fair values of the
company's yen currency exchange agreements, representing the amount the company
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements, were (in millions):

standards no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities" (sfas 133), as amended, is required to be adopted in fiscal years
beginning after june 15, 2000. sfas 133 will require the company to recognize
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. derivatives that are not
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. if the derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of
derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the

9. stock awards and options

       under the 1998 long term incentive plan, as amended, officers and key
employees of amr and its subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock purchase rights,
other stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards, including cash
bonuses. the total number of common shares authorized for distribution under the
1998 long term incentive plan is 10,000,000 shares. the 1998 long term incentive
plan, the successor to the 1988 long term incentive plan, which expired may 18,
1998, will terminate no later than may 21, 2008. options granted under the 1988
and 1998 long term incentive plans (collectively, the plans) are awarded with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on date of grant,
become exercisable in equal annual installments over five years following the
date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. stock appreciation
rights may be granted in tandem with options awarded.

       in 1999, 1998 and 1997, the total charge for stock compensation expense
included in wages, salaries and benefits expense was $53 million, $52 million
and $67 million, respectively. no compensation expense was recognized for stock
option grants under the plans since the exercise price was the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

       the weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share awards
granted during 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $62.95, $62.06 and $52.28, respectively.

       there were approximately 20 million shares of amr's common stock at
december 31, 1999 reserved for the issuance of stock upon the exercise of
options and the issuance of stock awards. see note 12 for information regarding
the impact on stock awards and options due to the sabre spin-off.

9. stock awards and options (continued)

       the company has adopted the pro forma disclosure features of statement of
financial accounting standards no. 123, "accounting for stock-based
compensation" (sfas 123). as required by sfas 123, pro forma information
regarding income from continuing operations and earnings per share from
continuing operations has been determined as if the company had accounted for
its employee stock options and awards granted subsequent to december 31, 1994
using the fair value method prescribed by sfas 123. the fair value for the stock
options was estimated at the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999, 1998 and 1997:
risk-free interest rates ranging from 5.01% to 6.07%; dividend yields of 0%;
expected stock volatility ranging from 25.5% to 31.3%; and expected life of the
options of 4.5 years for the plans and 1.5 years for the pilot plan.

       the black-scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. in addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. because the company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. in addition,
because sfas 123 is applicable only to options and stock-based awards granted
subsequent to december 31, 1994, its pro forma effect is not fully reflected in
years prior to 1999.

       the following table shows the company's pro forma income from continuing
operations and earnings per share from continuing operations assuming the
company had accounted for its employee stock options using the fair value method
(in millions, except per share amounts):

10. retirement benefits

       all employees of american and employees of certain other subsidiaries are
eligible to participate in pension plans. the defined benefit plans provide
benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average
compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. airline pilots
and flight engineers also participate in defined contribution plans for which
company contributions are determined as a percentage of participant
compensation.

       in addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including
certain health care and life insurance benefits, are also provided to retired
employees. the amount of health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as
outlined in the plan. substantially all employees of american and employees of
certain other subsidiaries may become eligible for these benefits if they
satisfy eligibility requirements during their working lives.

       certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of
their retiree health care benefits during their working lives. amr funds
benefits as incurred and makes contributions to match employee prefunding.

12. discontinued operations

       during the first quarter of 1999, the company completed the sales of amr
services, amr combs and teleservice resources. as a result of these sales, the
company recorded a gain of approximately $64 million, net of income taxes of
approximately $19 million.

       on february 7, 2000, the company declared its intent to distribute
amr's entire ownership interest in sabre as a dividend on all outstanding shares
of its common stock. to effect the dividend, amr exchanged all of its
107,374,000 shares of sabre's class b common stock for an equal number of shares
of sabre's class a common stock. effective after the close of business on march
15, 2000, amr distributed 0.722652 shares of sabre class a common stock for each
share of amr stock owned by amr's shareholders. the record date for the dividend
of sabre stock was the close of business on march 1, 2000. in addition, on
february 18, 2000, sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of $675 million
to shareholders of record of sabre common stock at the close of business on
february 15, 2000. based upon its approximate 83 percent interest in sabre, amr
received approximately $560 million of this dividend. these funds will be used
for general corporate purposes. the dividend of amr's entire ownership interest
in sabre's common stock resulted in a reduction to amr's retained earnings in
march of 2000 equal to the carrying value of the company's investment in sabre
on march 15, 2000, which approximated $600 million. the fair market value of
amr's investment in sabre on march 15, 2000, based upon the quoted market
closing price of sabre class a common stock on the new york stock exchange, was
approximately $5.2 billion. in addition, effective march 15, 2000, the company
reduced the exercise price and increased the number of stock options and awards
by approximately 18 million to offset the dilution to the holders, which
occurred as a result of the spin-off. these changes were made to keep the
holders in the same economic position as before the spin-off. this dilution
adjustment was determined in accordance with emerging issues task force
consensus no. 90-9, "changes to fixed employee stock option plans as a result of
equity restructuring," and will have no impact on earnings.

       the results of operations for sabre, amr services, amr combs and
teleservice resources have been reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations as discontinued operations. summarized financial information of the
discontinued operations is as follows (in millions):

13. segment reporting

       statement of financial accounting standards no. 131, "disclosures about
segments of an enterprise and related information" (sfas 131) requires that a
public company report annual and interim financial and descriptive information
about its reportable operating segments. operating segments, as defined, are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

       the company has two primary operating segments, consisting primarily of
american and amr eagle, which represent one reportable segment. american is one
of the largest scheduled passenger airlines in the world. at the end of 1999,
american provided scheduled jet service to more than 169 destinations throughout
north america, the caribbean, latin america, europe and the pacific. american is
also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a
full range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system. amr
eagle owns three regional airlines which operate as "american eagle" -- american
eagle airlines, inc., executive airlines, inc. and business express airlines,
inc. (acquired in march 1999). the american eagle carriers provide connecting
service from seven of american's high-traffic cities to smaller markets
throughout the united states, canada, the bahamas and the caribbean.

       revenues from other segments below the quantitative threshold for
determining reportable segments consist primarily of revenues from amr
investment services, inc., americas ground services and airline management
services. the difference between the financial information of the company's one
reportable segment and the financial information included in the consolidated
statements of operations and balance sheets as a result of these entities is not
material.

       the company's operating revenues by geographic region are summarized
below (in millions):
