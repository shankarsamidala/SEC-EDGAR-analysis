notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)

1.the   accompanying   unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for interim financial  information  and  with
  the  instructions  to form 10-q and article 10  of  regulation  s-x.
  accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and
  footnotes  required by generally accepted accounting principles  for
  complete financial statements.  in the opinion of management,  these
  financial  statements contain all adjustments, consisting of  normal
  recurring  accruals,  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
  position,  results  of  operations and cash flows  for  the  periods
  indicated.   results of operations for the periods presented  herein
  are  not  necessarily indicative of results of  operations  for  the
  entire  year.   the  balance sheet at december  31,  1998  has  been
  derived  from  the audited financial statements at that  date.   for
  further  information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
  and  footnotes thereto included in the amr corporation (amr  or  the
  company) annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december  31,
  1998.   certain amounts from 1998 have been reclassified to  conform
  with the 1999 presentation.

2.accumulated   depreciation  of  owned  equipment  and  property   at
  september 30, 1999 and december 31, 1998, was $7.9 billion and  $7.3
  billion,  respectively.  accumulated amortization of  equipment  and
  property  under  capital leases at september 30, 1999  and  december
  31, 1998, was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

  effective  january 1, 1999, in order to more accurately reflect  the
  expected  useful  life  of  its aircraft, the  company  changed  its
  estimate of the depreciable lives of certain aircraft types from  20
  to  25  years  and  increased the residual value  from  five  to  10
  percent.   as a result of this change, depreciation and amortization
  expense  was  reduced by approximately $39 million and net  earnings
  was  increased  by  approximately $23 million, or $0.15  per  common
  share  diluted, for the three months ended september 30, 1999.   for
  the   nine  months  ended  september  30,  1999,  depreciation   and
  amortization expense was reduced by approximately $119  million  and
  net  earnings was increased by approximately $70 million,  or  $0.44
  per common share diluted.

3.the  miami  international airport authority is currently remediating
  various  environmental  conditions at  miami  international  airport
  (airport)  and  funding the remediation costs  through  landing  fee
  revenues.   future costs of the remediation effort may be  borne  by
  carriers  operating  at  the airport, including  american  airlines,
  inc.   (american),  through  increased  landing  fees  and/or  other
  charges.  the ultimate resolution of this matter is not expected  to
  have a significant impact on the financial position or liquidity  of
  amr.

4.as of september 30, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire
  the following aircraft:  85 boeing 737-800s, 26 boeing 777-200igws, 90
  embraer  emb-135s,  25 bombardier crj-700s and 11 embraer  emb-145s.
  deliveries of these aircraft extend through 2006.  payments for these
  aircraft approximate $1.0 billion during the remainder of 1999, $2.2
  billion  in  2000,  $1.9  billion  in  2001  and  an  aggregate   of
  approximately $1.5 billion in 2002 through 2006.

  in  april  1999,  the company announced that it will accelerate  the
  retirement  of  nine mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and 16  boeing  727-200
  aircraft, thereby eliminating american's entire dc-10 fleet  by  the
  end of 2000 and advancing the retirement of the boeing 727 fleet  to
  the end of 2003.

5.in  early  february  1999, some members of  the  allied  pilots
  association (apa) engaged in certain activities (increased sick time
  and  declining to fly additional trips) that resulted  in  numerous
  cancellations across american's system.  these actions were taken in
  response  to the acquisition of reno air, inc. (reno) and adversely
  impacted  the  company's 1999 net earnings. on  october  30,  1999,
  american  and  the  apa reached agreement on a  number  of  issues,
  including the integration of reno and american pilot workforces, and
  new  processes to facilitate and foster the amicable resolution  of
  future issues between american and the apa.

6.in  connection  with  a secondary offering  by  equant  n.v.  in
  february  1999,  the  company sold approximately 923,000  depository
  certificates for proceeds of $66 million.  the company recorded a pre-
  tax gain of $66 million as a result of this transaction.

7.the  results  of  operations for amr  services,  amr  combs  and
  teleservice  resources  have  been  reflected  in  the  consolidated
  statements of operations as discontinued operations.  during the first

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues increased $89 million, or 1.9  percent,
in  the  third  quarter  of 1999 versus the same  period  last  year.
american's  results  for  the  third  quarter  of  1999  reflect  the
acquisition of reno.  american's passenger revenues increased by  0.7
percent,  or  $29  million, compared to the third  quarter  of  1998.
american's  yield (the average amount one passenger pays to  fly  one
mile)  of  12.86 cents decreased by 3.2 percent compared to the  same
period in 1998.  domestic yields decreased 1.2 percent from the third
quarter of 1998.  international yields decreased 7.4 percent due to a
9.3  percent  decrease  in europe, a 5.9 percent  decrease  in  latin
america, and a 3.0 percent decrease in the pacific.  the decrease  in
domestic yields was due primarily to industry capacity additions, the
impact  of  international yield pressure on the domestic  portion  of
international  journeys,  and  the  growing  presence   of   low-cost
competitors.  the decrease in international yields was due  primarily
to large industry capacity additions in the transatlantic markets.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  4.1
percent  to  30.3 billion miles for the quarter ended  september  30,
1999.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  increased
6.1  percent  to  42.2 billion miles in the third  quarter  of  1999.
american's  domestic  traffic  increased  2.6  percent  on   capacity
increases  of 6.8 percent and international traffic grew 7.2  percent
on  capacity increases of 4.7 percent.  the increase in international
traffic  was  driven by a 41.9 percent increase  in  traffic  to  the
pacific on capacity growth of 35.1 percent, a 7.4 percent increase in
traffic  to  europe  on capacity growth of 10.5 percent,  and  a  1.5
increase  in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease  of  3.8
percent.   during the third quarter of 1998, american's  revenue  and
traffic  was positively impacted by the effects of pilot  strikes  at
two of its competitors.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 15.8 percent, or  $48  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express, a regional  carrier
based in the northeast, in march 1999.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 7.4 percent, or $293
million.   american's  jet  operations cost  per  asm  decreased  0.1
percent  to  9.21 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  5.5
percent, or $79 million, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for profit-
sharing.   aircraft  fuel  expense increased  14.0  percent,  or  $56
million, due to a 7.1 percent increase in american's fuel consumption
and  a  5.3 percent increase in american's average price per  gallon,
including taxes, and net of fuel hedging activity.  other rentals and
landing  fees increased $26 million, or 11.7 percent, due  to  higher
facilities  rent and landing fees across american's  system  and  the
addition  of reno.  aircraft rentals increased $19 million,  or  13.4
percent,  due primarily to the addition of reno and business  express
aircraft.   other  operating expense increased $74 million,  or  10.0
percent, due primarily to an increase in outsourced services,  travel
and  incidental  costs,  and the acquisition  of  reno  and  business
express.

other  expense increased $42 million due to an increase  in  interest
expense  resulting  from an increase in long-term debt  for  aircraft
financing,  and  a decrease in interest income resulting  from  lower
investment balances and a decline in interest rates.

revenues
revenues  for sabre increased $13 million, or 2.2 percent.  electronic
travel  distribution revenues increased approximately $37 million,  or
10.9  percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase  in
booking  volumes  and  an overall increase in the  average  price  per
booking  due  to a price increase implemented in february  1999.   the
increase  in  booking  fee revenues was also partially  driven  by  an
increase   in  bookings  made  through  sabre's  online  travel   site
(travelocity.com).   revenues  from information  technology  solutions
decreased approximately $24 million, or 9.1 percent, primarily due  to
services performed under the information technology services agreement
with  us  airways,  inc.  (us airways) moving  into  a  steady  state,
partially   offset  by  increased  revenues  from  other   information
technology outsourcing agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  decreased  $10  million,  or  2.0  percent,   due
primarily to decreases in contract labor expense and depreciation  and
amortization  expense,  partially offset  by  increases  in  salaries,
benefits  and employee-related expenses, subscriber incentive expense,
and advertising and miscellaneous selling  expenses.  contract   labor
expenses  decreased  due  to  a planned reduction  in  contract  labor
headcount.  depreciation and amortization expense decreased  primarily
due  to  the  reversal  of approximately $19 million  of  amortization
expense  on  the  deferred asset associated  with  the  stock  options
granted  to  us  airways due to a reduction in  the  market  price  of
sabre's   common   stock.   salaries,  benefits  and  employee-related
expenses  increased  as  a  result of  sales  growth  initiatives  and
increased  administrative  requirements  to  support  sabre's  growth,
higher  average  salaries and benefits costs,  and  severance  charges
related  to  the reduction in force of approximately 330 employees  at
the  end  of  august 1999.  subscriber incentive expense increased  in
order  to  maintain and expand sabre's travel agency subscriber  base.
advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses increased in  order  to
support sabre's growth initiatives.

other income
other income decreased 73.3 percent, or $11 million, due primarily  to
a  favorable  court  judgement relating to ticketnet  corporation,  an
inactive subsidiary of sabre, in the third quarter of 1998.

results of operations (continued)

for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998

summary amr recorded net earnings for the nine months ended september
30,  1999  of $705 million, or $4.44 per common share diluted.   this
compares  with  net earnings of $1,132 million, or $6.39  per  common
share  diluted, for the same period in 1998.  amr's operating  income
of  $1.2 billion decreased 39.4 percent, or $789 million, compared to
$2.0  billion  for the same period in 1998.  amr's net earnings  were
adversely  impacted by an illegal job action by some members  of  the
apa  during the first quarter of 1999, which negatively impacted  the
company's  net earnings by an estimated $140 million,  or  $0.88  per
common  share diluted.  this was partially offset by the gain on  the
sale  of  amr services, amr combs and teleservice resources, and  the
gain  from the sale of the equant n.v. depository certificates,  such
gains  aggregating approximately $101 million after taxes,  or  $0.64
per common share diluted.

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues decreased $118 million, or 0.9 percent,
during  the  first  nine months of 1999 versus the same  period  last
year. american's results for the nine months ended september 30, 1999
reflect  the  acquisition  of  reno.  american's  passenger  revenues
decreased by 2.4 percent, or $267 million, largely as a result of the
illegal  job  action  by some members of the  apa  during  the  first
quarter  of 1999.  american's yield of 12.98 cents decreased  by  4.8
percent  compared  to  the  same period  in  1998.   domestic  yields
decreased   3.0  percent  from  the  first  nine  months   of   1998.
international yields decreased 8.7 percent, reflecting a 9.1  percent
decrease in europe, an 8.9 percent decrease in the pacific and a  7.5
percent decrease in latin america. the decrease in domestic yield was
due  primarily  to increased capacity and fare sale activity  in  the
first  half of 1999 compared to the same period in 1998, the apa  job
action,  and the impact of international yield decreases on  domestic
yields.   the  decrease in international yields was due primarily  to
weak  international economies, large industry capacity additions  and
increased fare sale activity.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  2.5
percent to 84.5 billion miles for the nine months ended september 30,
1999.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  increased
3.3  percent to 120.4 billion miles in the first nine months of 1999.
american's domestic traffic increased 1.8 percent on capacity  growth
of 3.5 percent and international traffic grew 4.1 percent on capacity
increases of 2.9 percent.  the increase in international traffic  was
driven  by  a  46.7  percent increase in traffic to  the  pacific  on
capacity growth of 50.2 percent and a 4.5 percent increase in traffic
to  europe  on  capacity growth of 7.5 percent.  this  was  partially
offset  by  a 2.1 percent decrease in traffic to latin america  on  a
capacity decline of 6.0 percent.

american's  operations were adversely impacted  by  several  external
factors  primarily  in the second quarter of 1999.   first,  american
experienced record delays and cancellations due to weather, primarily
at  its  dallas-fort  worth  and  chicago  hubs.   in  addition,  the
implementation of the federal aviation administration's  new  display
screen   replacement   (dsr)  system  caused  numerous   delays   and
cancellations  across american's system as three of  the  first  five
centers  to  receive the new dsr system - fort worth, new  york,  and
chicago  -  are high-traffic cities in american's network  which  are
responsible for a significant amount of american's traffic.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 13.4 percent, or $114  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express in march 1999.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.8 percent, or $676
million.   american's jet operations cost per asm  increased  by  1.2
percent  to 9.38 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  $262
million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for profit-
sharing.  other  rentals and landing fees increased $76  million,  or
11.9  percent, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees  across
american's  system  and  the  addition  of  reno.   aircraft  rentals
increased $56 million, or 13.1 percent, due primarily to the addition
of  reno  and  business  express aircraft.  other  operating  expense
increased $235 million, or 11.0 percent, due primarily to an increase
in  outsourced  services, travel and incidental costs, booking  fees,
aircraft  maintenance work performed by american for other  airlines,
and the acquisition of reno and business express.

other  expense  increased  0.8 percent, or  $1  million,  due  to  an
increase in capitalized interest on aircraft purchase deposits and  a
$31  million gain on the sale of a portion of american's interest  in
equant  n.v., offset by a decrease in interest income resulting  from
lower  investment  balances and a decline in interest  rates  and  an
increase  in interest expense resulting from an increase in long-term
debt for aircraft financing.

revenues
revenues for sabre increased $159 million, or 9.2 percent.  electronic
travel distribution revenues increased approximately $123 million,  or
12.0  percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase  in
booking  volumes  and  an overall increase in the  average  price  per

increase  in  booking  fee revenues was also partially  driven  by  an

from  information  technology  solutions increased  approximately  $36
million, or 5.1 percent, primarily due to services performed under the
various information technology services agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  increased  $152 million,  or  10.8  percent,  due
primarily  to  increases  in salaries, benefits  and  employee-related
expenses, subscriber incentive expense, data processing expenses,  and
advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses, partially offset by  a
decrease  in  depreciation and amortization  expense,  contract  labor
expenses,  and  expenses  associated with  the  marketing  cooperation
agreement  with  american.   salaries, benefits  and  employee-related
expenses  increased  as  a  result of  sales  growth  initiatives  and
increased  administrative  requirements  to  support  sabre's  growth,
higher  average  salaries and benefits costs,  and  severance  charges

data  processing  costs increased due to the growth  in  bookings  and
transactions   processed.   advertising  and   miscellaneous   selling
expenses  increased  in order to support sabre's  growth  initiatives.
depreciation  and amortization expense decreased primarily  due  to  a
reduction  in  the reserve for obsolete computer equipment,  partially
offset   by  additional  depreciation  expense  associated  with   new
equipment  additions.   contract labor expenses  decreased  due  to  a
planned reduction in contract labor headcount.

other income
other income increased $27 million primarily due to a $35 million gain
on  the  sale of equant n.v. depository certificates held by  american
for  the  economic benefit of sabre, partially offset by  a  favorable
court   judgement  relating  to  ticketnet  corporation,  an  inactive
subsidiary of sabre, in the third quarter of 1998.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash  provided  by operating activities in the nine-month  period
ended  september 30, 1999 was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $408 million
over the same period in 1998.  this decrease resulted primarily from a
decrease  in  net earnings.  capital expenditures for the  first  nine
months of 1999 were $2.9 billion, and included the acquisition  of  18
boeing  737-800s,  11  boeing 777-200igws, six boeing  757-200s,  four
boeing  767-300ers,  19  embraer 145s and five embraer  135  aircraft.
these  capital  expenditures were financed with  internally  generated
cash,  except  for  14  boeing aircraft which  were  financed  through
secured  mortgage agreements, one boeing aircraft which  was  financed
through  a sale-leaseback transaction, and the embraer aircraft  which
were  funded  through secured debt agreements.  on  october  6,  1999,
american  issued $600 million of pass-through certificates  which  are
secured  by 15 boeing aircraft.  interest on these certificates  range
from 6.855 to 7.324 percent and mature in 2004 and 2009.  a portion of
these  proceeds  were  used  to repay $170  million  of  secured  debt
borrowed by american during september 1999.

    as  of  september 30, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire
the following aircraft:  85 boeing 737-800s, 26 boeing 777-200igws, 90
embraer  emb-135s,  25  bombardier crj-700s and 11  embraer  emb-145s.
deliveries of these aircraft extend through 2006.  payments for  these
aircraft  approximate $1.0 billion during the remainder of 1999,  $2.2
billion   in   2000,  $1.9  billion  in  2001  and  an  aggregate   of
approximately  $1.5 billion in 2002 through 2006. the company  expects
to  fund  its  remaining 1999 capital expenditures from the  company's
existing  cash and short-term investments, internally generated  cash,
and  new  financing depending upon capital market conditions  and  the
company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

  in  april  1999,  the company announced that it will accelerate  the
retirement  of  nine  mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and  16  boeing  727-200
aircraft, thereby eliminating american's entire dc-10 fleet by the end
of  2000 and advancing the retirement of the boeing 727 fleet  to  the
end of 2003.

   on july 13, 1999, the company issued $150 million of unsecured debt
bearing  interest  at 7.875 percent, maturing on july  13,  2039,  and
callable at par after july 13, 2004.

    during  the  nine  months ended september 30,  1999,  the  company
purchased approximately 14.1 million shares of its common stock  at  a
cost  of approximately $871 million.  additional share repurchases  of
up  to $34 million, which is the remaining amount currently authorized
by  the  company's board of directors, may be made from time to  time,
depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time.

    in  march 1999, sabre's board of directors authorized, subject  to
certain  business and market conditions, the repurchase of up  to  1.0
million  shares  of  sabre's class a common stock.   during  the  nine
months ended september 30, 1999, sabre purchased all such shares at  a
cost  of  approximately $59 million.  on september 15,  1999,  sabre's
board  of directors authorized, subject to certain business and market
conditions,  the  repurchase of up to an additional  $100  million  of
sabre's class a common stock.

   in  connection with a secondary offering by equant n.v. in february
1999,  the  company sold approximately 923,000 depository certificates
for  proceeds  of  $66 million.  during the first half  of  1999,  the
company  acquired  approximately 400,000 depository certificates  from
other  airlines.  in addition, based upon a reallocation  between  the
owners  of  the  certificates in july 1999, the  company  received  an
additional  2.6  million certificates.  accordingly, as  of  september
30,  1999,  the  company  holds approximately 5.3  million  depository
certificates  with  an  estimated market value of  approximately  $433
million.

   on  october  4,  1999, sabre announced the terms  of  a  merger  of
travelocity,  an  operating  unit of sabre (travelocity)  and  preview
travel, inc. (preview), an independent publicly traded company engaged
in  consumer direct travel distribution over the internet.  under  the
terms  of  the merger agreement, shareholders of preview will  receive
one  share  of  travelocity.com inc., a newly  created  subsidiary  of
sabre, for each share of preview held, and preview will be merged into
travelocity.com inc., which will be the surviving entity.  sabre  will
attempt  to obtain a listing of the shares of travelocity.com inc.  on
the   nasdaq  exchange.   assuming  that  the  listing  is   obtained,
travelocity.com  inc. will be a publicly traded company.   immediately
prior  to  the merger, sabre will contribute the existing  assets  and
businesses  of travelocity and approximately $50 million  in  cash  to
travelocity.com lp, a delaware limited partnership (the  partnership).
immediately following the merger, travelocity.com inc. will contribute
the assets and businesses obtained from the acquisition of preview  to
the  partnership.  as a result of the merger agreement, sabre will own
an  economic  interest  of  70  percent in  the  combined  businesses,
composed of a 64 percent direct interest in the partnership and an  18
percent interest in travelocity.com inc., which will hold a 36 percent
interest in the partnership.

   upon  consummation of the merger, sabre anticipates  that  it  will
recognize  a gain and record goodwill based upon the ownership  of
travelocity  exchanged for the ownership interest in preview.   in
addition,  during the ten days  following  the  merger, travelocity.com
inc. has the right to cause sabre to  purchase with cash  up  to an
additional $50 million in travelocity.com inc. common stock.

other information

the  company  has  previously indicated  that  it  is  considering  a
potential spin-off transaction in which amr would distribute  to  its
shareholders all of its ownership interest in sabre.  in the event of
a spin-off of sabre, the earnings and assets of sabre would no longer
be available to amr.

year 2000 readiness

state  of readiness   in 1995, the company implemented a project  (the
year  2000  project)  to  ensure that hardware  and  software  systems
operated  by  the company, including software licensed to or  operated
for  third  parties  by  sabre, are designed to operate  and  properly
manage dates beyond december 31, 1999 (year 2000 readiness).  the year
2000  project consists of six phases: (i) awareness, (ii)  assessment,
(iii)  analysis, design and remediation, (iv) testing and  validation,
(v)  quality  assurance review (to ensure consistency  throughout  the
year  2000 project) and (vi) creation of business continuity strategy,
including plans in the event of year 2000 failures.  in developing the
company's  proprietary  software  analysis,  remediation  and  testing
methodology for year 2000 readiness, it studied the best practices  of
the  institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the british
standards  institution.  the company has assessed  (i)  the  company's
over  1,000 information technology and operating systems that will  be
utilized  after  december 31, 1999 (it systems); (ii)  non-information
technology  systems,  including embedded technology,  facilities,  and
other  systems (non-it systems); and (iii) the year 2000 readiness  of
its critical third party service providers.

      it systems   the company has completed the first five phases  of
the  year  2000  project  for  all of its it  systems,  including  its
computer  reservations and flight operating system  applications  that
perform  such  "mission  critical" functions  as  passenger  bookings,
ticketing,  passenger check-in, aircraft weight  and  balance,  flight
planning  and  baggage and cargo processing.  as of october  1,  1999,
approximately 45 percent of those it systems (including  the  computer
reservations  systems) are already successfully processing  year  2000
dates  in  actual use.  the company has installed year 2000  readiness
hardware and software at all of its locations worldwide.  the  company
is  following structured clean management processes to keep all of its
it systems year 2000 ready.

     non-it  systems   the company has completed the first five phases
of  the year 2000 project for all of its non-it systems which includes
aircraft avionics and flight simulators.  the company believes that is
has adequate contingency plans to ensure business continuity if any of
its non-it systems are not year 2000 ready.

                                     -18-

    third  party services   the company's business is dependent  upon
entities   which  supply  critical  infrastructure  to  the   airline
industry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of  the
federal    aviation   administration   and   international   aviation
authorities,   the   department   of  transportation,   and   airport
authorities.  those  service providers depend on their  hardware  and
software  systems  and on interfaces with the company's  it  systems.
the  company  is  actively involved in the air transport  association
(ata)  and  the international air transport association  (iata)  year
2000  airline  industry program to ensure the readiness of  airports,
air  traffic  service  providers, and  commercial  airline  suppliers
worldwide.   as part of this program, the ata and iata are monitoring
approximately  2,500  airports,  185  air  traffic  control   service
providers,   and   more  than  5,000  commercial  airline   suppliers
throughout  the  world  regarding their  year  2000  readiness.   the
results of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic and
international   airports  in  which  american  operates   have   made
significant    progress   towards   their   year   2000    readiness.
nevertheless, the company continues to closely monitor  the  progress
of  a  number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for  the
year 2000, could disrupt the company's ability to provide services to
its customers.

   in  addition,  the company relies on third party service  providers
for  many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power,  and
data  and credit card transaction processing.  those service providers
depend  on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces  with
the  company's  it  systems.  the company is monitoring  its  critical
service providers regarding their year 2000 readiness and has received
responses  from  over  90 percent of its critical  service  providers.
such  respondents assured the company that their software and hardware
is  or  will be year 2000 ready.  to the extent practical, the company
will  implement  contingencies for the third  party  critical  service
providers that have not responded.

    the  company  does  not  expect the year  2000  issues  it  might
encounter  with third parties to be materially different  from  those
encountered by other airlines, including the company's competitors.

costs  of year 2000 project   the company expects to incur significant
hardware,  software and labor costs, as well as consulting  and  other
expenses, in its year 2000 project. the company's total estimated cost
of  the  project  is  $215  to $220 million,  of  which  approximately
$210  million was incurred as of september 30, 1999.  costs associated
with  the  year  2000  project are expensed as  incurred,  other  than
capitalized  hardware costs, and have been funded  through  cash  from
operations.

risks  of  year 2000 non-readiness   the economy in general,  and  the
travel  and transportation industries in particular, may be  adversely
affected  by  risks  associated  with the  year  2000.  the  company's
business,  financial  condition, and results of  operations  could  be
materially  adversely affected if systems that it operates or  systems
that  are  operated by third party service providers  upon  which  the
company  relies  are not year 2000 ready in time.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that these systems will continue to properly  function  and
interface and will otherwise be year 2000 ready.  management  believes
that  its  most likely year 2000 risks relate to the failure of  third
parties with whom it has material relationships to be year 2000 ready.

    although the company is not aware of any threatened claims related
to  the  year  2000, the company may be subject to litigation  arising
from  such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation could
have  a  material  adverse affect on the company.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that the company's insurance coverage would be adequate  to
offset these and other business risks related to the year 2000 issue.

business  continuity plans   the company has identified four potential
risk  areas  related to the year 2000 and is developing  and  refining
plans  to continue its business in the event of year 2000 failures  in
response  to  those risks. the company believes that its  most  likely
year  2000 risks relate to the failure of third parties with  whom  it
has material relationships to be year 2000 ready.  in response to this
risk,  the  company has been actively participating with the  ata  and
iata  year  2000 airline industry program to ensure the  readiness  of
airports  and air traffic services worldwide.  the company is  in  the
process of collecting additional business continuity information  from
such  suppliers  in  order to effectively manage  any  failures.   the
second   risk  area  relates  to  the  effective  prioritization   and
management of any year 2000 failures.  the company is establishing  an
enterprise  command  center  in  order to  prioritize  issues,  manage
resources, coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in the
event  of  year  2000 failures.  the third risk area  relates  to  the
possibility that the company's employees will fail to report  to  work
on  or  around  december 31, 1999, thereby potentially disrupting  the
company's operations.  somewhat mitigating this risk is that the company
will be operating a reduced holiday schedule due to soft passenger demand.
in addition, the company may undertake initiatives to encourage personnel
to work as scheduled. the  fourth  risk  area  relates to the failure of
critical internal business processes, services, systems and facilities.

                                       -19-
<page> 22
the  company  has tested all systems including those not  impacted  by
dates  and  has  completed approximately 98 percent  of  its  business
continuity plans to manage potential internal year 2000 failures.  the
company's   business  continuity  plans  include  performing   certain
processes  manually; maintaining dedicated staff to  be  available  at
crucial dates to remedy unforeseen problems; installing defensive code
to  protect  real-time  systems from improperly  formatted  date  data
supplied by third parties; repairing or obtaining replacement systems;
and  reducing  or  suspending  certain  non-critical  aspects  of  the
company's  services  or  operations.  in addition,  the  company  will
assess  its  operational  readiness  by  evaluating  mission  critical
systems  and  reporting the status to the enterprise  command  center.
appropriate  actions  will  be taken when  issues  regarding  industry
readiness   impacts  the  airline's  operations.    because   of   the
pervasiveness and complexity of the year 2000 issue, and in particular
the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third parties to
be   year  2000  ready,  the  company  will  continue  to  refine  its
contingency plans during the fourth quarter.

    the  costs of the project and the date on which the company plans
to complete the year 2000 readiness program are based on management's
best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions  of
future   events  including  the  continued  availability  of  certain
resources,  third party modification plans and other  factors.   even
though  the  company has met all established deadlines and  the  cost
estimates  have  remained  constant,  actual  results  could   differ
materially  from these estimates.  specific factors that might  cause
such  material  differences include, but  are  not  limited  to,  the
availability and cost of personnel trained in this area, the  ability
to  locate  and correct all relevant computer codes, the  failure  of
third parties to be year 2000 ready, and similar uncertainties.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas  and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three  states (kansas, mississippi and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft  configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997  amendment).   in
october  1997,  the  city of fort worth filed suit in  state  district
court  against  the city of dallas and others seeking to  enforce  the
bond ordinance.  fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does  not
preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights  to
restrict  traffic at love field in a manner consistent with  the  bond
ordinance  and,  moreover, that dallas has an  obligation  to  do  so.
american  joined in this litigation.  on october 15, 1998,  the  state
district  court  granted summary judgment in favor of fort  worth  and
american,  which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort  worth
court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that
irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use
agreement  prohibits  american and other dfw signatory  airlines  from
moving  any interstate operations to love field.  these claims  remain
unresolved.   dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment  action  in
federal  district court seeking to have the court declare that,  as  a
matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes dallas from exercising any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental  airlines  and  continental express  filed  a  lawsuit  in
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using  regional jets.   in  december  1998,  the
department of transportation (dot) issued an order on the federal  law
questions  concerning  the bond ordinance, local  proprietary  powers,
dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright
and  1997  amendments,  and  concluded that  the  bond  ordinance  was
preempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable.  the  dot
also  found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american  from
conducting interstate operations at love field.  fort worth,  american
and  dfw  have appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court  of
appeals.

    as  a  result  of the foregoing, the future of interstate  flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
could adversely impact american's business.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
two  purported class action cases (wolens et al v. american  airlines,
inc. and tucker v. american airlines, inc.) that were consolidated and
are  currently pending in the circuit court of cook county,  illinois.
the   litigation  arises  from  certain  changes  made  to  american's
aadvantage frequent flyer program in may 1988 which limited the number
of seats available to participants traveling on certain awards. in the
consolidated action, the plaintiffs seek to represent all persons  who
joined  the  aadvantage program before may 1988  and  accrued  mileage
credits  before the seat limitations were introduced and  allege  that
these  changes  breached american's contract with aadvantage  members.
plaintiffs  seek  money damages and attorneys'  fees.   the  complaint
originally  asserted  several  state  law  claims,  however  only  the
plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.  s.  supreme
court  ruled  that  the airline deregulation act preempted  the  other
claims.   although  the case has been pending for numerous  years,  it
still  is in its preliminary stages.  the court has not ruled  on  the
plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  american has a motion for
judgement  on  the pleadings pending and is vigorously  defending  the
lawsuit.

    gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. is also pending in the
circuit  court  of cook county, illinois.  in december 1993,  american
announced that the number of miles required to claim a certain  travel
award  under  american's aadvantage frequent flyer  program  would  be
increased  effective february 1, 1995, giving rise  to  the  gutterman
litigation  filed  on that same date.  the gutterman plaintiffs  claim
that  the  increase  in  award mileage level violated  the  terms  and
conditions  of the agreement between american and aadvantage  members.
on  june  23,  1998, the court certified the case as a  class  action,
although  to  date  no notice has been sent to the class.   the  class
consists  of all members who earned miles between january 1, 1992  and
february 1, 1995 (the date the change became effective).  on july  13,
1998,  the court denied american's motion for summary judgment  as  to
the  claims brought by plaintiff steven gutterman.  on july 30,  1998,
the  plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as  to  liability,
which  motion  has  not  been  ruled  upon.   american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    a  federal grand jury in miami is investigating whether  american
and  american eagle handled hazardous materials and processed courier
shipments,  cargo  and excess baggage in accordance  with  applicable
laws and regulations.  in connection with this investigation, federal
agents  executed a search warrant at american's miami  facilities  on
october  22,  1997.   since  that time, a number  of  employees  have
testified  before  the grand jury.  in addition,  american  has  been
served  with three subpoenas calling for the production of  documents
relating to the handling of courier shipments, cargo, excess  baggage
and  hazardous  materials  handling and  spills.   american  produced
documents  responsive to the three subpoenas.   american  intends  to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998,  continental,  delta  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
american  intends to vigorously defend the granting  of  the  summary
judgment on appeal.

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo shippers adversely affected by an illegal sick-out by  some
of  american's pilots in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american  independently  liable.
instead, plaintiffs named american as a defendant inasmuch as american
has  a $45.5 million judgment against the apa that exceeds apa's total
assets.   plaintiffs claim they are entitled to some  or  all  of  the
apa's limited funds.  apa filed cross claims against american alleging
that  american must indemnify pilots who put themselves  on  the  sick
list.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  july  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed  against  amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding  corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc.  in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district   of
california,  western  division (westways world  travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp., et al).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies  to
pay  debit  memos to american for violations of american's fare  rules
(by  customers of the agencies) violates the racketeer influenced  and
corrupt  organizations  act of 1970 (rico).  the  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations from july
26,  1995  to  the present.  plaintiffs seek to enjoin  american  from
enforcing  the  pricing rules in question and to recover  the  amounts
paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

    on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to  remedy  the alleged effects  of  its  past  conduct.
american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

    between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to  the  present, although to date no class has been  certified.
american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

item 5.  other information

the  department of justice is investigating the competitive  practices
of   major  carriers  at  major  hub  airports,  including  american's
practices  at  dfw  (for  further  information,  see  item  1.   legal
proceedings).   also, in april 1998, the dot issued  proposed  pricing
and  capacity rules that would severely limit major carriers'  ability
to   compete  with  new  entrant  carriers.   the  outcomes   of   the
investigations  and the proposed dot rules are unknown.   however,  to
the  extent that (i) restrictions are imposed upon american's  ability
to  respond  to  a competitor, or (ii) competitors have  an  advantage
because  of  federal assistance, american's business may be  adversely
impacted.

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues increased $89 million, or 1.9  percent,
in  the  third  quarter  of 1999 versus the same  period  last  year.
american's  results  for  the  third  quarter  of  1999  reflect  the
acquisition of reno.  american's passenger revenues increased by  0.7
percent,  or  $29  million, compared to the third  quarter  of  1998.
american's  yield (the average amount one passenger pays to  fly  one
mile)  of  12.86 cents decreased by 3.2 percent compared to the  same
period in 1998.  domestic yields decreased 1.2 percent from the third
quarter of 1998.  international yields decreased 7.4 percent due to a
9.3  percent  decrease  in europe, a 5.9 percent  decrease  in  latin
america, and a 3.0 percent decrease in the pacific.  the decrease  in
domestic yields was due primarily to industry capacity additions, the
impact  of  international yield pressure on the domestic  portion  of
international  journeys,  and  the  growing  presence   of   low-cost
competitors.  the decrease in international yields was due  primarily
to large industry capacity additions in the transatlantic markets.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  4.1
percent  to  30.3 billion miles for the quarter ended  september  30,
1999.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  increased
6.1  percent  to  42.2 billion miles in the third  quarter  of  1999.
american's  domestic  traffic  increased  2.6  percent  on   capacity
increases  of 6.8 percent and international traffic grew 7.2  percent
on  capacity increases of 4.7 percent.  the increase in international
traffic  was  driven by a 41.9 percent increase  in  traffic  to  the
pacific on capacity growth of 35.1 percent, a 7.4 percent increase in
traffic  to  europe  on capacity growth of 10.5 percent,  and  a  1.5
increase  in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease  of  3.8
percent.   during the third quarter of 1998, american's  revenue  and
traffic  was positively impacted by the effects of pilot  strikes  at
two of its competitors.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 15.8 percent, or  $48  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express, a regional  carrier
based in the northeast, in march 1999.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 7.4 percent, or $293
million.   american's  jet  operations cost  per  asm  decreased  0.1
percent  to  9.21 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  5.5
percent, or $79 million, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for profit-
sharing.   aircraft  fuel  expense increased  14.0  percent,  or  $56
million, due to a 7.1 percent increase in american's fuel consumption
and  a  5.3 percent increase in american's average price per  gallon,
including taxes, and net of fuel hedging activity.  other rentals and
landing  fees increased $26 million, or 11.7 percent, due  to  higher
facilities  rent and landing fees across american's  system  and  the
addition  of reno.  aircraft rentals increased $19 million,  or  13.4
percent,  due primarily to the addition of reno and business  express
aircraft.   other  operating expense increased $74 million,  or  10.0
percent, due primarily to an increase in outsourced services,  travel
and  incidental  costs,  and the acquisition  of  reno  and  business
express.

other  expense increased $42 million due to an increase  in  interest
expense  resulting  from an increase in long-term debt  for  aircraft
financing,  and  a decrease in interest income resulting  from  lower
investment balances and a decline in interest rates.

revenues
revenues  for sabre increased $13 million, or 2.2 percent.  electronic
travel  distribution revenues increased approximately $37 million,  or
10.9  percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase  in
booking  volumes  and  an overall increase in the  average  price  per
booking  due  to a price increase implemented in february  1999.   the
increase  in  booking  fee revenues was also partially  driven  by  an
increase   in  bookings  made  through  sabre's  online  travel   site
(travelocity.com).   revenues  from information  technology  solutions
decreased approximately $24 million, or 9.1 percent, primarily due  to
services performed under the information technology services agreement
with  us  airways,  inc.  (us airways) moving  into  a  steady  state,
partially   offset  by  increased  revenues  from  other   information
technology outsourcing agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  decreased  $10  million,  or  2.0  percent,   due
primarily to decreases in contract labor expense and depreciation  and
amortization  expense,  partially offset  by  increases  in  salaries,
benefits  and employee-related expenses, subscriber incentive expense,
and advertising and miscellaneous selling  expenses.  contract   labor
expenses  decreased  due  to  a planned reduction  in  contract  labor
headcount.  depreciation and amortization expense decreased  primarily
due  to  the  reversal  of approximately $19 million  of  amortization
expense  on  the  deferred asset associated  with  the  stock  options
granted  to  us  airways due to a reduction in  the  market  price  of
sabre's   common   stock.   salaries,  benefits  and  employee-related
expenses  increased  as  a  result of  sales  growth  initiatives  and
increased  administrative  requirements  to  support  sabre's  growth,
higher  average  salaries and benefits costs,  and  severance  charges
related  to  the reduction in force of approximately 330 employees  at
the  end  of  august 1999.  subscriber incentive expense increased  in
order  to  maintain and expand sabre's travel agency subscriber  base.
advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses increased in  order  to
support sabre's growth initiatives.

other income
other income decreased 73.3 percent, or $11 million, due primarily  to
a  favorable  court  judgement relating to ticketnet  corporation,  an
inactive subsidiary of sabre, in the third quarter of 1998.

for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998

summary amr recorded net earnings for the nine months ended september
30,  1999  of $705 million, or $4.44 per common share diluted.   this
compares  with  net earnings of $1,132 million, or $6.39  per  common
share  diluted, for the same period in 1998.  amr's operating  income
of  $1.2 billion decreased 39.4 percent, or $789 million, compared to
$2.0  billion  for the same period in 1998.  amr's net earnings  were
adversely  impacted by an illegal job action by some members  of  the
apa  during the first quarter of 1999, which negatively impacted  the
company's  net earnings by an estimated $140 million,  or  $0.88  per
common  share diluted.  this was partially offset by the gain on  the
sale  of  amr services, amr combs and teleservice resources, and  the
gain  from the sale of the equant n.v. depository certificates,  such
gains  aggregating approximately $101 million after taxes,  or  $0.64
per common share diluted.

results of operations (continued)

the  airline group's revenues decreased $118 million, or 0.9 percent,
during  the  first  nine months of 1999 versus the same  period  last
year. american's results for the nine months ended september 30, 1999
reflect  the  acquisition  of  reno.  american's  passenger  revenues
decreased by 2.4 percent, or $267 million, largely as a result of the
illegal  job  action  by some members of the  apa  during  the  first
quarter  of 1999.  american's yield of 12.98 cents decreased  by  4.8
percent  compared  to  the  same period  in  1998.   domestic  yields
decreased   3.0  percent  from  the  first  nine  months   of   1998.
international yields decreased 8.7 percent, reflecting a 9.1  percent
decrease in europe, an 8.9 percent decrease in the pacific and a  7.5
percent decrease in latin america. the decrease in domestic yield was
due  primarily  to increased capacity and fare sale activity  in  the
first  half of 1999 compared to the same period in 1998, the apa  job
action,  and the impact of international yield decreases on  domestic
yields.   the  decrease in international yields was due primarily  to
weak  international economies, large industry capacity additions  and
increased fare sale activity.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  2.5
percent to 84.5 billion miles for the nine months ended september 30,
1999.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  increased
3.3  percent to 120.4 billion miles in the first nine months of 1999.
american's domestic traffic increased 1.8 percent on capacity  growth
of 3.5 percent and international traffic grew 4.1 percent on capacity
increases of 2.9 percent.  the increase in international traffic  was
driven  by  a  46.7  percent increase in traffic to  the  pacific  on
capacity growth of 50.2 percent and a 4.5 percent increase in traffic
to  europe  on  capacity growth of 7.5 percent.  this  was  partially
offset  by  a 2.1 percent decrease in traffic to latin america  on  a
capacity decline of 6.0 percent.

american's  operations were adversely impacted  by  several  external
factors  primarily  in the second quarter of 1999.   first,  american
experienced record delays and cancellations due to weather, primarily
at  its  dallas-fort  worth  and  chicago  hubs.   in  addition,  the
implementation of the federal aviation administration's  new  display
screen   replacement   (dsr)  system  caused  numerous   delays   and
cancellations  across american's system as three of  the  first  five
centers  to  receive the new dsr system - fort worth, new  york,  and
chicago  -  are high-traffic cities in american's network  which  are
responsible for a significant amount of american's traffic.

amr  eagle's  revenues increased 13.4 percent, or $114  million,  due
primarily to the acquisition of business express in march 1999.

the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.8 percent, or $676
million.   american's jet operations cost per asm  increased  by  1.2
percent  to 9.38 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  $262
million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent  employees  and  contractual  wage  rate   and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  company's   labor
contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for profit-
sharing.  other  rentals and landing fees increased $76  million,  or
11.9  percent, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees  across
american's  system  and  the  addition  of  reno.   aircraft  rentals
increased $56 million, or 13.1 percent, due primarily to the addition
of  reno  and  business  express aircraft.  other  operating  expense
increased $235 million, or 11.0 percent, due primarily to an increase
in  outsourced  services, travel and incidental costs, booking  fees,
aircraft  maintenance work performed by american for other  airlines,
and the acquisition of reno and business express.

other  expense  increased  0.8 percent, or  $1  million,  due  to  an
increase in capitalized interest on aircraft purchase deposits and  a
$31  million gain on the sale of a portion of american's interest  in
equant  n.v., offset by a decrease in interest income resulting  from
lower  investment  balances and a decline in interest  rates  and  an
increase  in interest expense resulting from an increase in long-term
debt for aircraft financing.

revenues
revenues for sabre increased $159 million, or 9.2 percent.  electronic
travel distribution revenues increased approximately $123 million,  or
12.0  percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase  in
booking  volumes  and  an overall increase in the  average  price  per
booking  due  to a price increase implemented in february  1999.   the
increase  in  booking  fee revenues was also partially  driven  by  an
increase  in bookings made through the travelocity.com site.  revenues
from  information  technology  solutions increased  approximately  $36
million, or 5.1 percent, primarily due to services performed under the
various information technology services agreements signed during 1998.

expenses
operating  expenses  increased  $152 million,  or  10.8  percent,  due
primarily  to  increases  in salaries, benefits  and  employee-related
expenses, subscriber incentive expense, data processing expenses,  and
advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses, partially offset by  a
decrease  in  depreciation and amortization  expense,  contract  labor
expenses,  and  expenses  associated with  the  marketing  cooperation
agreement  with  american.   salaries, benefits  and  employee-related
expenses  increased  as  a  result of  sales  growth  initiatives  and
increased  administrative  requirements  to  support  sabre's  growth,
higher  average  salaries and benefits costs,  and  severance  charges
related  to  the reduction in force of approximately 330 employees  at
the  end  of  august 1999.  subscriber incentive expense increased  in
order  to  maintain and expand sabre's travel agency subscriber  base.
data  processing  costs increased due to the growth  in  bookings  and
transactions   processed.   advertising  and   miscellaneous   selling
expenses  increased  in order to support sabre's  growth  initiatives.
depreciation  and amortization expense decreased primarily  due  to  a
reduction  in  the reserve for obsolete computer equipment,  partially
offset   by  additional  depreciation  expense  associated  with   new
equipment  additions.   contract labor expenses  decreased  due  to  a
planned reduction in contract labor headcount.

other income
other income increased $27 million primarily due to a $35 million gain
on  the  sale of equant n.v. depository certificates held by  american
for  the  economic benefit of sabre, partially offset by  a  favorable
court   judgement  relating  to  ticketnet  corporation,  an  inactive
subsidiary of sabre, in the third quarter of 1998.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash  provided  by operating activities in the nine-month  period
ended  september 30, 1999 was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $408 million
over the same period in 1998.  this decrease resulted primarily from a
decrease  in  net earnings.  capital expenditures for the  first  nine
months of 1999 were $2.9 billion, and included the acquisition  of  18
boeing  737-800s,  11  boeing 777-200igws, six boeing  757-200s,  four
boeing  767-300ers,  19  embraer 145s and five embraer  135  aircraft.
these  capital  expenditures were financed with  internally  generated
cash,  except  for  14  boeing aircraft which  were  financed  through
secured  mortgage agreements, one boeing aircraft which  was  financed
through  a sale-leaseback transaction, and the embraer aircraft  which
were  funded  through secured debt agreements.  on  october  6,  1999,
american  issued $600 million of pass-through certificates  which  are
secured  by 15 boeing aircraft.  interest on these certificates  range
from 6.855 to 7.324 percent and mature in 2004 and 2009.  a portion of
these  proceeds  were  used  to repay $170  million  of  secured  debt
borrowed by american during september 1999.

    as  of  september 30, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire
the following aircraft:  85 boeing 737-800s, 26 boeing 777-200igws, 90
embraer  emb-135s,  25  bombardier crj-700s and 11  embraer  emb-145s.
deliveries of these aircraft extend through 2006.  payments for  these
aircraft  approximate $1.0 billion during the remainder of 1999,  $2.2
billion   in   2000,  $1.9  billion  in  2001  and  an  aggregate   of
approximately  $1.5 billion in 2002 through 2006. the company  expects
to  fund  its  remaining 1999 capital expenditures from the  company's
existing  cash and short-term investments, internally generated  cash,
and  new  financing depending upon capital market conditions  and  the
company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

  in  april  1999,  the company announced that it will accelerate  the
retirement  of  nine  mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and  16  boeing  727-200
aircraft, thereby eliminating american's entire dc-10 fleet by the end
of  2000 and advancing the retirement of the boeing 727 fleet  to  the
end of 2003.

   on july 13, 1999, the company issued $150 million of unsecured debt
bearing  interest  at 7.875 percent, maturing on july  13,  2039,  and
callable at par after july 13, 2004.

    during  the  nine  months ended september 30,  1999,  the  company
purchased approximately 14.1 million shares of its common stock  at  a
cost  of approximately $871 million.  additional share repurchases  of
up  to $34 million, which is the remaining amount currently authorized
by  the  company's board of directors, may be made from time to  time,
depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time.

    in  march 1999, sabre's board of directors authorized, subject  to
certain  business and market conditions, the repurchase of up  to  1.0
million  shares  of  sabre's class a common stock.   during  the  nine
months ended september 30, 1999, sabre purchased all such shares at  a
cost  of  approximately $59 million.  on september 15,  1999,  sabre's
board  of directors authorized, subject to certain business and market
conditions,  the  repurchase of up to an additional  $100  million  of
sabre's class a common stock.

   in  connection with a secondary offering by equant n.v. in february
1999,  the  company sold approximately 923,000 depository certificates
for  proceeds  of  $66 million.  during the first half  of  1999,  the
company  acquired  approximately 400,000 depository certificates  from
other  airlines.  in addition, based upon a reallocation  between  the
owners  of  the  certificates in july 1999, the  company  received  an
additional  2.6  million certificates.  accordingly, as  of  september
30,  1999,  the  company  holds approximately 5.3  million  depository
certificates  with  an  estimated market value of  approximately  $433
million.

   on  october  4,  1999, sabre announced the terms  of  a  merger  of
travelocity,  an  operating  unit of sabre (travelocity)  and  preview
travel, inc. (preview), an independent publicly traded company engaged
in  consumer direct travel distribution over the internet.  under  the
terms  of  the merger agreement, shareholders of preview will  receive
one  share  of  travelocity.com inc., a newly  created  subsidiary  of
sabre, for each share of preview held, and preview will be merged into
travelocity.com inc., which will be the surviving entity.  sabre  will
attempt  to obtain a listing of the shares of travelocity.com inc.  on
the   nasdaq  exchange.   assuming  that  the  listing  is   obtained,
travelocity.com  inc. will be a publicly traded company.   immediately
prior  to  the merger, sabre will contribute the existing  assets  and
businesses  of travelocity and approximately $50 million  in  cash  to
travelocity.com lp, a delaware limited partnership (the  partnership).
immediately following the merger, travelocity.com inc. will contribute
the assets and businesses obtained from the acquisition of preview  to
the  partnership.  as a result of the merger agreement, sabre will own
an  economic  interest  of  70  percent in  the  combined  businesses,
composed of a 64 percent direct interest in the partnership and an  18
percent interest in travelocity.com inc., which will hold a 36 percent
interest in the partnership.

   upon  consummation of the merger, sabre anticipates  that  it  will
recognize  a gain and record goodwill based upon the ownership  of
travelocity  exchanged for the ownership interest in preview.   in
addition,  during the ten days  following  the  merger, travelocity.com
inc. has the right to cause sabre to  purchase with cash  up  to an
additional $50 million in travelocity.com inc. common stock.

other information

the  company  has  previously indicated  that  it  is  considering  a
potential spin-off transaction in which amr would distribute  to  its
shareholders all of its ownership interest in sabre.  in the event of
a spin-off of sabre, the earnings and assets of sabre would no longer
be available to amr.

year 2000 readiness

state  of readiness   in 1995, the company implemented a project  (the
year  2000  project)  to  ensure that hardware  and  software  systems
operated  by  the company, including software licensed to or  operated
for  third  parties  by  sabre, are designed to operate  and  properly
manage dates beyond december 31, 1999 (year 2000 readiness).  the year
2000  project consists of six phases: (i) awareness, (ii)  assessment,
(iii)  analysis, design and remediation, (iv) testing and  validation,
(v)  quality  assurance review (to ensure consistency  throughout  the
year  2000 project) and (vi) creation of business continuity strategy,
including plans in the event of year 2000 failures.  in developing the
company's  proprietary  software  analysis,  remediation  and  testing
methodology for year 2000 readiness, it studied the best practices  of
the  institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the british
standards  institution.  the company has assessed  (i)  the  company's
over  1,000 information technology and operating systems that will  be
utilized  after  december 31, 1999 (it systems); (ii)  non-information
technology  systems,  including embedded technology,  facilities,  and
other  systems (non-it systems); and (iii) the year 2000 readiness  of
its critical third party service providers.

      it systems   the company has completed the first five phases  of
the  year  2000  project  for  all of its it  systems,  including  its
computer  reservations and flight operating system  applications  that
perform  such  "mission  critical" functions  as  passenger  bookings,
ticketing,  passenger check-in, aircraft weight  and  balance,  flight
planning  and  baggage and cargo processing.  as of october  1,  1999,
approximately 45 percent of those it systems (including  the  computer
reservations  systems) are already successfully processing  year  2000
dates  in  actual use.  the company has installed year 2000  readiness
hardware and software at all of its locations worldwide.  the  company
is  following structured clean management processes to keep all of its
it systems year 2000 ready.

     non-it  systems   the company has completed the first five phases
of  the year 2000 project for all of its non-it systems which includes
aircraft avionics and flight simulators.  the company believes that is
has adequate contingency plans to ensure business continuity if any of
its non-it systems are not year 2000 ready.

    third  party services   the company's business is dependent  upon
entities   which  supply  critical  infrastructure  to  the   airline
industry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of  the
federal    aviation   administration   and   international   aviation
authorities,   the   department   of  transportation,   and   airport
authorities.  those  service providers depend on their  hardware  and
software  systems  and on interfaces with the company's  it  systems.
the  company  is  actively involved in the air transport  association
(ata)  and  the international air transport association  (iata)  year
2000  airline  industry program to ensure the readiness of  airports,
air  traffic  service  providers, and  commercial  airline  suppliers
worldwide.   as part of this program, the ata and iata are monitoring
approximately  2,500  airports,  185  air  traffic  control   service
providers,   and   more  than  5,000  commercial  airline   suppliers
throughout  the  world  regarding their  year  2000  readiness.   the
results of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic and
international   airports  in  which  american  operates   have   made
significant    progress   towards   their   year   2000    readiness.
nevertheless, the company continues to closely monitor  the  progress
of  a  number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for  the
year 2000, could disrupt the company's ability to provide services to
its customers.

   in  addition,  the company relies on third party service  providers
for  many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power,  and
data  and credit card transaction processing.  those service providers
depend  on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces  with
the  company's  it  systems.  the company is monitoring  its  critical
service providers regarding their year 2000 readiness and has received
responses  from  over  90 percent of its critical  service  providers.
such  respondents assured the company that their software and hardware
is  or  will be year 2000 ready.  to the extent practical, the company
will  implement  contingencies for the third  party  critical  service
providers that have not responded.

    the  company  does  not  expect the year  2000  issues  it  might
encounter  with third parties to be materially different  from  those
encountered by other airlines, including the company's competitors.

costs  of year 2000 project   the company expects to incur significant
hardware,  software and labor costs, as well as consulting  and  other
expenses, in its year 2000 project. the company's total estimated cost
of  the  project  is  $215  to $220 million,  of  which  approximately
$210  million was incurred as of september 30, 1999.  costs associated
with  the  year  2000  project are expensed as  incurred,  other  than
capitalized  hardware costs, and have been funded  through  cash  from
operations.

risks  of  year 2000 non-readiness   the economy in general,  and  the
travel  and transportation industries in particular, may be  adversely
affected  by  risks  associated  with the  year  2000.  the  company's
business,  financial  condition, and results of  operations  could  be
materially  adversely affected if systems that it operates or  systems
that  are  operated by third party service providers  upon  which  the
company  relies  are not year 2000 ready in time.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that these systems will continue to properly  function  and
interface and will otherwise be year 2000 ready.  management  believes
that  its  most likely year 2000 risks relate to the failure of  third
parties with whom it has material relationships to be year 2000 ready.

    although the company is not aware of any threatened claims related
to  the  year  2000, the company may be subject to litigation  arising
from  such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation could
have  a  material  adverse affect on the company.   there  can  be  no
assurance  that the company's insurance coverage would be adequate  to
offset these and other business risks related to the year 2000 issue.

business  continuity plans   the company has identified four potential
risk  areas  related to the year 2000 and is developing  and  refining
plans  to continue its business in the event of year 2000 failures  in
response  to  those risks. the company believes that its  most  likely
year  2000 risks relate to the failure of third parties with  whom  it
has material relationships to be year 2000 ready.  in response to this
risk,  the  company has been actively participating with the  ata  and
iata  year  2000 airline industry program to ensure the  readiness  of
airports  and air traffic services worldwide.  the company is  in  the
process of collecting additional business continuity information  from
such  suppliers  in  order to effectively manage  any  failures.   the
second   risk  area  relates  to  the  effective  prioritization   and
management of any year 2000 failures.  the company is establishing  an
enterprise  command  center  in  order to  prioritize  issues,  manage
resources, coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in the
event  of  year  2000 failures.  the third risk area  relates  to  the
possibility that the company's employees will fail to report  to  work
on  or  around  december 31, 1999, thereby potentially disrupting  the
company's operations.  somewhat mitigating this risk is that the company
will be operating a reduced holiday schedule due to soft passenger demand.
in addition, the company may undertake initiatives to encourage personnel
to work as scheduled. the  fourth  risk  area  relates to the failure of
critical internal business processes, services, systems and facilities.

the  company  has tested all systems including those not  impacted  by
dates  and  has  completed approximately 98 percent  of  its  business
continuity plans to manage potential internal year 2000 failures.  the
company's   business  continuity  plans  include  performing   certain
processes  manually; maintaining dedicated staff to  be  available  at
crucial dates to remedy unforeseen problems; installing defensive code
to  protect  real-time  systems from improperly  formatted  date  data
supplied by third parties; repairing or obtaining replacement systems;
and  reducing  or  suspending  certain  non-critical  aspects  of  the
company's  services  or  operations.  in addition,  the  company  will
assess  its  operational  readiness  by  evaluating  mission  critical
systems  and  reporting the status to the enterprise  command  center.
appropriate  actions  will  be taken when  issues  regarding  industry
readiness   impacts  the  airline's  operations.    because   of   the
pervasiveness and complexity of the year 2000 issue, and in particular
the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third parties to
be   year  2000  ready,  the  company  will  continue  to  refine  its
contingency plans during the fourth quarter.

    the  costs of the project and the date on which the company plans
to complete the year 2000 readiness program are based on management's
best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions  of
future   events  including  the  continued  availability  of  certain
resources,  third party modification plans and other  factors.   even
though  the  company has met all established deadlines and  the  cost
estimates  have  remained  constant,  actual  results  could   differ
materially  from these estimates.  specific factors that might  cause
such  material  differences include, but  are  not  limited  to,  the
availability and cost of personnel trained in this area, the  ability
to  locate  and correct all relevant computer codes, the  failure  of
third parties to be year 2000 ready, and similar uncertainties.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas  and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the  consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three  states (kansas, mississippi and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft  configured with 56 seats or less (the 1997  amendment).   in
october  1997,  the  city of fort worth filed suit in  state  district
court  against  the city of dallas and others seeking to  enforce  the
bond ordinance.  fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does  not
preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights  to
restrict  traffic at love field in a manner consistent with  the  bond
ordinance  and,  moreover, that dallas has an  obligation  to  do  so.
american  joined in this litigation.  on october 15, 1998,  the  state
district  court  granted summary judgment in favor of fort  worth  and
american,  which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort  worth
court of appeals.  in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that
irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use
agreement  prohibits  american and other dfw signatory  airlines  from
moving  any interstate operations to love field.  these claims  remain
unresolved.   dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment  action  in
federal  district court seeking to have the court declare that,  as  a
matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes dallas from exercising any
restrictions  on  operations at love field.   further,  in  may  1998,
continental  airlines  and  continental express  filed  a  lawsuit  in
federal  court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond  ordinance
cannot  be  enforced to prevent them from operating flights from  love
field  to  cleveland  using  regional jets.   in  december  1998,  the
department of transportation (dot) issued an order on the federal  law
questions  concerning  the bond ordinance, local  proprietary  powers,
dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright
and  1997  amendments,  and  concluded that  the  bond  ordinance  was
preempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable.  the  dot
also  found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american  from
conducting interstate operations at love field.  fort worth,  american
and  dfw  have appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court  of
appeals.

    as  a  result  of the foregoing, the future of interstate  flight
operations  at  love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain.   an
increase  in  operations at love field to new interstate destinations
could adversely impact american's business.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
two  purported class action cases (wolens et al v. american  airlines,
inc. and tucker v. american airlines, inc.) that were consolidated and
are  currently pending in the circuit court of cook county,  illinois.
the   litigation  arises  from  certain  changes  made  to  american's
aadvantage frequent flyer program in may 1988 which limited the number
of seats available to participants traveling on certain awards. in the
consolidated action, the plaintiffs seek to represent all persons  who
joined  the  aadvantage program before may 1988  and  accrued  mileage
credits  before the seat limitations were introduced and  allege  that
these  changes  breached american's contract with aadvantage  members.
plaintiffs  seek  money damages and attorneys'  fees.   the  complaint
originally  asserted  several  state  law  claims,  however  only  the
plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.  s.  supreme
court  ruled  that  the airline deregulation act preempted  the  other
claims.   although  the case has been pending for numerous  years,  it
still  is in its preliminary stages.  the court has not ruled  on  the
plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  american has a motion for
judgement  on  the pleadings pending and is vigorously  defending  the
lawsuit.

    gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. is also pending in the
circuit  court  of cook county, illinois.  in december 1993,  american
announced that the number of miles required to claim a certain  travel
award  under  american's aadvantage frequent flyer  program  would  be
increased  effective february 1, 1995, giving rise  to  the  gutterman
litigation  filed  on that same date.  the gutterman plaintiffs  claim
that  the  increase  in  award mileage level violated  the  terms  and
conditions  of the agreement between american and aadvantage  members.
on  june  23,  1998, the court certified the case as a  class  action,
although  to  date  no notice has been sent to the class.   the  class
consists  of all members who earned miles between january 1, 1992  and
february 1, 1995 (the date the change became effective).  on july  13,
1998,  the court denied american's motion for summary judgment  as  to
the  claims brought by plaintiff steven gutterman.  on july 30,  1998,
the  plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as  to  liability,
which  motion  has  not  been  ruled  upon.   american  is  vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

    a  federal grand jury in miami is investigating whether  american
and  american eagle handled hazardous materials and processed courier
shipments,  cargo  and excess baggage in accordance  with  applicable
laws and regulations.  in connection with this investigation, federal
agents  executed a search warrant at american's miami  facilities  on
october  22,  1997.   since  that time, a number  of  employees  have
testified  before  the grand jury.  in addition,  american  has  been
served  with three subpoenas calling for the production of  documents
relating to the handling of courier shipments, cargo, excess  baggage
and  hazardous  materials  handling and  spills.   american  produced
documents  responsive to the three subpoenas.   american  intends  to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.

    on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on behalf of all passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998,  continental,  delta  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff has filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit.
american  intends to vigorously defend the granting  of  the  summary
judgment on appeal.

    on  may 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo shippers adversely affected by an illegal sick-out by  some
of  american's pilots in february 1999 were consolidated in the united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
plaintiffs  are  not  seeking to hold american  independently  liable.
instead, plaintiffs named american as a defendant inasmuch as american
has  a $45.5 million judgment against the apa that exceeds apa's total
assets.   plaintiffs claim they are entitled to some  or  all  of  the
apa's limited funds.  apa filed cross claims against american alleging
that  american must indemnify pilots who put themselves  on  the  sick
list.  american is vigorously defending all claims against it.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

    on  july  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed  against  amr
corporation,  american airlines, inc., amr eagle holding  corporation,
airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre group holdings, inc.  in
the  united  states  district  court  for  the  central  district   of
california,  western  division (westways world  travel,  inc.  v.  amr
corp., et al).  the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies  to
pay  debit  memos to american for violations of american's fare  rules
(by  customers of the agencies) violates the racketeer influenced  and
corrupt  organizations  act of 1970 (rico).  the  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations from july
26,  1995  to  the present.  plaintiffs seek to enjoin  american  from
enforcing  the  pricing rules in question and to recover  the  amounts
paid for debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
american intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

    on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to  remedy  the alleged effects  of  its  past  conduct.
american intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

    between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to  the  present, although to date no class has been  certified.
american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

item 5.  other information

the  department of justice is investigating the competitive  practices
of   major  carriers  at  major  hub  airports,  including  american's
practices  at  dfw  (for  further  information,  see  item  1.   legal
proceedings).   also, in april 1998, the dot issued  proposed  pricing
and  capacity rules that would severely limit major carriers'  ability
to   compete  with  new  entrant  carriers.   the  outcomes   of   the
investigations  and the proposed dot rules are unknown.   however,  to
the  extent that (i) restrictions are imposed upon american's  ability
to  respond  to  a competitor, or (ii) competitors have  an  advantage
because  of  federal assistance, american's business may be  adversely
impacted.
