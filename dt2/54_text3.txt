company’s ability to return to profitability and its ability to continue to fund
its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of
which are largely beyond the company’s control.  certain risk factors
that affect the company’s business and financial results are discussed in the
risk factors listed in item 1a.  in addition, most of the company’s
largest domestic competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for
bankruptcy in recent years and have used this process to significantly reduce
contractual labor and other costs.  in order to remain competitive and
to improve its financial condition, the company must continue to take steps to
generate additional revenues and to reduce its costs.  although the
company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue
challenges, the ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time
and cannot be assured.  it will be very difficult for the company to
continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis and return to
profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve
substantially and if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended
period at high levels.</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman">the
impact of fuel price changes on the company and its competitors depends on
various factors, including hedging strategies.  the company has a fuel
hedging program in which it enters into jet fuel and heating oil hedging
contracts to dampen the impact of the volatility of jet fuel prices. during
2008, 2007 and 2006, the company’s fuel hedging program reduced the company’s
fuel expense by approximately $344 million, $215 million and $88 million,
respectively. as of january 2009, the company had cash flow hedges, with option
contracts, primarily heating oil collars and call options, covering
approximately 35 percent of its estimated 2009 fuel requirements. the
consumption hedged for 2009 by cash flow hedges is capped at an average price of
approximately $2.59 per gallon of jet fuel, and the company’s collars have an
average floor price of approximately $1.94 per gallon of jet fuel (both the
capped and floor price exclude taxes and transportation costs).  as a
result of the rapid decline in energy prices in the second half of 2008 and
certain other events, the company estimates that during the next twelve months
it will reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings
approximately $645 million and $66 million in net incremental expenses related
to its fuel derivative hedges (based on prices as of december 31, 2008) for
american and amr eagle, respectively.  a deterioration of the
company’s financial position could negatively affect the company’s ability to
hedge fuel in the future. see the risk factors under item 1a for additional
information regarding fuel.</font><font style="display: inline; font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman">item
