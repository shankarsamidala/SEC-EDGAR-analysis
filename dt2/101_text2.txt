notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)

1.the   accompanying   unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for interim financial  information  and  with
  the  instructions  to form 10-q and article 10  of  regulation  s-x.
  accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and
  footnotes  required by generally accepted accounting principles  for
  complete financial statements.  in the opinion of management,  these
  financial  statements contain all adjustments, consisting of  normal
  recurring  accruals,  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
  position,  results  of  operations and cash flows  for  the  periods
  indicated.   results of operations for the periods presented  herein
  are  not  necessarily indicative of results of  operations  for  the
  entire  year.   the  balance sheet at december  31,  1999  has  been
  derived  from  the audited financial statements at that  date.   the
  results  of  operations, cash flows and net assets for  sabre,  inc.
  (sabre),  amr  services,  amr combs and teleservice  resources  have
  been   reflected  in  the  consolidated  financial   statements   as
  discontinued   operations  (see  note  7  below),  and  accordingly,
  related  information previously reported in the september  30,  1999
  form 10-q has been restated.  for further information, refer to  the
  consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included  in
  the  amr corporation (amr or the company) annual report on form 10-k
  for the year ended december 31, 1999.

2.accumulated   depreciation  of  owned  equipment  and  property   at
  september 30, 2000 and december 31, 1999, was $8.0 billion and  $7.4
  billion,  respectively.  accumulated amortization of  equipment  and
  property  under  capital leases at september 30, 2000  and  december
  31, 1999, was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

3.as  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial  statements
  included  in the company's annual report on form 10-k for  the  year
  ended  december 31, 1999, the miami international airport  authority
  is  currently remediating various environmental conditions at  miami
  international  airport (airport) and funding the  remediation  costs
  through  landing  fee  revenues.  future costs  of  the  remediation
  effort  may be borne by carriers operating at the airport, including
  american  airlines,  inc. (american), a wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
  the  company,  through increased landing fees and/or other  charges.
  in  addition,  the  company is subject to  environmental  issues  at
  various   other  airport  and  non-airport  locations.    management
  believes,  after considering a number of factors, that the  ultimate
  disposition  of  these  environmental  issues  is  not  expected  to
  materially  affect  the company's consolidated  financial  position,
  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.   amounts  recorded   for
  environmental issues are based on the company's current  assessments
  of   the  ultimate  outcome  and,  accordingly,  could  increase  or
  decrease as these assessments change.

4.as of october 2, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the
  following  aircraft:  67 boeing 737-800s, 21 boeing 777-200igws,  20
  boeing 757-200s, 153 embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s.
  deliveries of these aircraft extend through 2006.  payments for these
  aircraft will approximate $600 million during the remainder of 2000,
  $2.5  billion  in  2001, $1.25 billion in 2002 and an  aggregate  of
  approximately $1.7 billion in 2003 through 2006.

5.during  the  third  quarter  of  2000,  amr  repurchased  prior   to
  scheduled maturity approximately $167 million in face value of long-
  term  debt.   cash  from operations provided  the  funding  for  the
  repurchases.   these transactions resulted in an extraordinary  loss
  of $14 million ($9 million after-tax).

6.during   1999,   the   company  entered  into  an   agreement   with
  priceline.com  incorporated  (priceline)  whereby  ticket  inventory
  provided  by the company may be sold through priceline's  e-commerce
  system.   in  conjunction with this agreement, the company  received
  warrants  to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of  priceline
  common  stock.   in  the second quarter of 2000,  the  company  sold
  these  warrants  for  proceeds  of approximately  $94  million,  and
  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain of $57 million ($36  million  after-tax),
  which  is  included  in  miscellaneous -  net  on  the  consolidated
  statements of operations.

7.during  the first quarter of 1999, the company completed  the  sales
  of  amr  services, amr combs and teleservice resources.  as a result
  of  these  sales,  the company recorded a gain of approximately  $64
  million, net of income taxes of approximately $19 million.

  effective  after  the  close of business  on  march  15,  2000,  amr
  distributed 0.722652 shares of sabre class a common stock  for  each
  share  of  amr stock owned by amr's shareholders.  the  record  date
  for  the dividend of sabre stock was the close of business on  march
  1,  2000.   in addition, on february 18, 2000, sabre paid a  special
  one-time cash dividend of $675 million to shareholders of record  of
  sabre  common stock at the close of business on february  15,  2000.
  based  upon  its  approximate  83 percent  interest  in  sabre,  amr
  received  approximately $559 million of this dividend.  these  funds
  will   be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including   the
  acquisition  of  aircraft.  the dividend of amr's  entire  ownership
  interest  in sabre's common stock resulted in a reduction  to  amr's
  retained  earnings in march of 2000 equal to the carrying  value  of
  the   company's  investment  in  sabre  on  march  15,  2000,  which
  approximated $581 million.  in addition, effective march  15,  2000,
  the  company reduced the exercise price and increased the number  of
  stock  options  and  other stock-based awards  by  approximately  18
  million to offset the dilution to the holders, which occurred  as  a
  result  of  the  spin-off.  these changes  were  made  to  keep  the
  holders in the same economic position as before the spin-off.   this
  dilution  adjustment  was  determined in  accordance  with  emerging
  issues  task  force consensus no. 90-9, "changes to  fixed  employee
  stock  option  plans  as  a  result of  equity  restructuring,"  and
  accordingly, had no impact on earnings.

  the  results  of operations for sabre, amr services, amr  combs  and
  teleservice  resources  have  been  reflected  in  the  consolidated
  statements  of  operations  as  discontinued  operations.   the  net
  assets  of  sabre of approximately $1.0 billion were  classified  in

  instruments  and  hedging activities" (sfas 133),  as  amended,  is
  required  to  be adopted in fiscal years beginning after  june  15,
  2000.   sfas  133  will  require  the  company  to  recognize   all
  derivatives  on the balance sheet at fair value.  derivatives  that
  are  not  hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.  if
  the  derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of  the  hedge,
  changes  in  the  fair value of derivatives will either  be  offset
  against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities,
  or  firm  commitments  through  earnings  or  recognized  in  other
  comprehensive  income  until  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in
  earnings.  the ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair
  value will be immediately recognized in earnings.  the company will

item  2.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended september 30, 2000 and 1999

summary  amr's income from continuing operations before extraordinary
loss during the third quarter of 2000 was $322 million, or $1.96  per
common  share  diluted,  as compared to $213 million,  or  $1.38  per
common  share diluted, for the same period in 1999.  amr's  operating
income  of $572 million increased $146 million compared to  the  same
period  in  1999.   amr's third quarter 2000 results from  continuing
operations  include the effect of a labor disruption at  one  of  the
company's  major competitors which positively impacted the  company's
net earnings by an estimated $0.22 to $0.28 per common share diluted.

the  company's revenues increased $561 million, or 11.9  percent,  in
the  third  quarter  of  2000  versus  the  same  period  last  year.
american's  passenger  revenues increased by 12.4  percent,  or  $485
million,  compared  to the third quarter of 1999.   american's  yield
(the  average  amount one passenger pays to fly one  mile)  of  13.88
cents  increased by 7.9 percent compared to the same period in  1999.
domestic yields increased 7.9 percent from the third quarter of 1999.
international yields increased 8.1 percent, reflecting an increase of
13.3  percent, 4.8 percent and 4.5 percent in europe, latin  american
and  pacific yields, respectively.  the increase in revenues was  due
primarily  to a strong u.s. economy, which led to strong  demand  for
air travel both domestically and internationally, a favorable pricing
climate,  and  a  labor  disruption at one  of  the  company's  major
competitors  which  positively impacted  the  company's  revenues  by
approximately $80 million to $100 million.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  4.2
percent  to  31.6 billion miles for the quarter ended  september  30,
2000.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  decreased
2.0  percent  to  41.4 billion miles in the third  quarter  of  2000.
american's  domestic  traffic increased 3.3  percent  on  a  capacity
decrease  of  3.4  percent and international  traffic  increased  5.9
percent  on  capacity  increases of 1.1  percent.   the  decrease  in
domestic  capacity  was  due primarily to the  company's  "more  room
throughout coach" initiative.  the increase in international  traffic
was  driven  by  an  8.7  percent increase in traffic  to  europe  on
capacity growth of 4.6 percent, a 7.1 percent increase in traffic  to
the  pacific on a capacity increase of 0.4 percent and a 2.9  percent
increase  in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease  of  1.8
percent.

american  eagle's passenger revenues increased 10.8 percent,  or  $38
million.  american eagle's traffic increased to 1.0 billion rpms,  up
10.3  percent, while capacity increased to 1.6 billion asms,  or  8.6
percent, in the third quarter of 2000.

cargo  revenues increased $23 million, or 14.4 percent, due primarily
to  a  fuel  surcharge  implemented in february 2000,  the  company's
increase in cargo capacity from the addition of new aircraft in  late
1999  and 2000, and a labor disruption at one of the company's  major
competitors.

the  company's  operating expenses increased  9.7  percent,  or  $415
million.   american's cost per asm increased 11.9  percent  to  10.31
cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased 12.3 percent, or  $188
million,  primarily  due  to an increase in  the  average  number  of
equivalent  employees, contractual wage rate and seniority  increases
that are built into the company's labor contracts and an increase  of
approximately  $75  million  in  the  provision  for  profit-sharing.
aircraft fuel expense increased 42.1 percent, or $192 million, due to
a 38.3 percent increase in the company's average price per gallon and
a  2.7  percent  increase  in the company's  fuel  consumption.   the
increase  in  fuel  expense  is net of gains  of  approximately  $159
million  recognized during the third quarter of 2000 related  to  the
company's   fuel  hedging  program.   depreciation  and  amortization
expense increased $31 million, or 11.2 percent, due primarily to  the
addition  of  new  aircraft.  commissions to  agents  decreased  15.3
percent,  or  $48 million, despite an increase of approximately  12.3
percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit from  the
international  base  commission  structure  changes  implemented   in
october  1999  and  january 2000, respectively,  and  a  decrease  in
commissionable transactions.

interest  income  increased  $21  million  due  primarily  to  higher
investment balances.  interest expense increased $11 million, or 10.2
percent, due to an increase in the average outstanding long-term debt
balance in 2000.  interest capitalized increased 33.3 percent, or  $9
million, due primarily to an increase in purchase deposits for flight
equipment.

results of operations (continued)

for the nine months ended september 30, 2000 and 1999

summary  amr's income from continuing operations before extraordinary
loss  for  the nine months ended september 30, 2000 was $732 million,
or  $4.55  per common share diluted.  this compares with income  from
continuing  operations  of $446 million, or $2.81  per  common  share
diluted, for the same period in 1999.  amr's operating income of $1.3
billion increased 46.8 percent, or $415 million, compared to the same
period  in  1999.   amr's  2000  results from  continuing  operations
include  the  effect of a labor disruption at one  of  the  company's
major  competitors  which  positively  impacted  the  company's   net
earnings by an estimated $0.22 to $0.28 per common share diluted
and an approximate  $36  million  after-tax gain,  or $0.22  per
common  share diluted, related to the sale of the company's  warrants
to   purchase   5.5  million  shares  of  priceline.com  incorporated
(priceline)  common  stock.   amr's  1999  results  from   continuing
operations include a labor disagreement that disrupted the  company's
operations and negatively impacted the company's 1999 net earnings by
an  estimated  $140  million,  or $0.87  per  common  share  diluted,
partially  offset  by an approximate $19 million after-tax  gain,  or
$0.12  per common share diluted, related to the sale of a portion  of
american's holdings in equant, n.v. (equant).

the  company's revenues increased approximately $1.6 billion, or 12.1
percent, during the first nine months of 2000 versus the same  period
last  year.  american's passenger revenues increased by 12.5 percent,
or  approximately  $1.4 billion.  american's  yield  of  13.86  cents
increased  by  6.8  percent  compared to the  same  period  in  1999.
domestic  yields increased 6.6 percent from the first nine months  of
1999.   international  yields increased 7.5  percent,  reflecting  an
increase  of  12.0 percent, 10.4 percent and 4.8 percent in  pacific,
europe  and  latin american yields, respectively.   the  increase  in
revenues  was  due primarily to a strong u.s. economy, which  led  to
strong demand for air travel both domestically and internationally, a
favorable  pricing  climate, and a labor disruption  at  one  of  the
company's  major competitors which positively impacted the  company's
revenues  by  approximately $80 million to $100 million.   the  first
quarter  of  1999  includes  a schedule disruption  which  negatively
impacted the company's operations.

american's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms)  increased  5.4
percent to 89.1 billion miles for the nine months ended september 30,
2000.   american's capacity or available seat miles (asms)  increased
1.0  percent to 121.5 billion miles in the first nine months of 2000.
american's  domestic  traffic increased 4.2  percent  on  a  capacity
decrease  of  0.5  percent and international  traffic  increased  7.8
percent  on  capacity  increases of 4.2  percent.   the  decrease  in
domestic  capacity  was  due primarily to the  company's  "more  room
throughout coach" initiative.  the increase in international  traffic
was  driven  by a 12.7 percent increase in traffic to the pacific  on
capacity growth of 3.5 percent, a 10.1 percent increase in traffic to
europe  on  a  capacity increase of 7.9 percent  and  a  4.6  percent
increase  in  traffic  to  latin america on capacity  growth  of  1.4
percent.

american eagle's passenger revenues increased 13.8 percent,  or  $133
million.  american eagle's traffic increased to 2.8 billion rpms,  up
13.1  percent, while capacity increased to 4.7 billion asms, or  13.4
percent, in the first nine months of 2000.

cargo  revenues increased $61 million, or 13.0 percent, due primarily
to  a  fuel  surcharge  implemented in february 2000,  the  company's
increase in cargo capacity from the addition of new aircraft in  late
1999  and 2000, and a labor disruption at one of the company's  major
competitors.

the   company's   operating  expenses  increased  9.6   percent,   or
approximately $1.2 billion.  american's cost per asm increased by 8.4
percent to 10.17 cents.  wages, salaries and benefits increased  $451
million, or 9.9 percent, primarily due to an increase in the  average
number  of  equivalent employees, contractual wage rate and seniority
increases  that are built into the company's labor contracts  and  an
increase  of approximately $114 million in the provision for  profit-
sharing.   aircraft  fuel expense increased  45.0  percent,  or  $549
million,  due  to  a  39.7 percent increase in the company's  average
price  per  gallon and a 4.1 percent increase in the  company's  fuel
consumption.  the  increase  in fuel  expense  is  net  of  gains  of
approximately  $391 million recognized during the nine  months  ended
september  30,  2000 related to the company's fuel  hedging  program.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $92 million, or  11.5
percent, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft.

results of operations (continued)

maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased 10.5 percent, or
$78  million,  due  primarily to an increase in airframe  and  engine
maintenance  volumes  at  the  company's  maintenance  bases  and  an
approximate $17 million one-time credit the company received  in  the
second  quarter  of  1999.   commissions  to  agents  decreased  11.6
percent,  or $104 million, despite an increase of approximately  12.6
percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit from  the
international  base  commission  structure  changes  implemented   in
october  1999  and  january 2000, respectively,  and  a  decrease  in
commissionable transactions.

interest income increased 74.2 percent, or $46 million, due primarily
to  higher  investment  balances.   interest  expense  increased  $58
million,  or  19.7  percent,  due  to  an  increase  in  the  average
outstanding  long-term  debt balance in 2000.   interest  capitalized
increased  23.6  percent,  or $21 million,  due  to  an  increase  in
purchase  deposits  for  flight  equipment.   miscellaneous   -   net
increased  $23  million due primarily to the  gain  on  sale  of  the
company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common
stock  in the second quarter of 2000, which resulted in a $57 million
gain.   in  the  first  quarter  of 1999,  the  company  recorded  an
approximate  $31  million  gain on the  sale  of  a  portion  of  the
company's interest in equant.

liquidity and capital resources

net  cash  provided by operating activities in the nine-month  period
ended  september  30,  2000 was $2.7 billion,  an  increase  of  $886
million  over  the  same  period  in 1999.   this  increase  resulted
primarily from an increase in the air traffic liability due to higher
advanced  sales and an increase in income from continuing operations.
capital  expenditures for the first nine months  of  2000  were  $2.8
billion,  and  included the acquisition of 13 boeing 777-200igws,  21
boeing  737-800s,  17  embraer  135 aircraft  and  five  embraer  145
aircraft.   these capital expenditures were financed with  internally
generated  cash and the $559 million of cash received from the  sabre
dividend,  except  for the embraer aircraft acquisitions  which  were
funded through secured debt agreements.

  as  of  october 2, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire  the
following  aircraft:   67 boeing 737-800s, 21 boeing  777-200igws,  20
boeing 757-200s, 153 embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s.
deliveries of these aircraft extend through 2006.  payments for  these
aircraft  will approximate $600 million during the remainder of  2000,
$2.5  billion  in  2001, $1.25 billion in 2002  and  an  aggregate  of
approximately $1.7 billion in 2003 through 2006.  the company  expects
to  fund  these capital expenditures from the company's existing  cash
and   short-term  investments,  internally  generated  cash,  and  new
financing depending upon market conditions and the company's  evolving
view of its long-term needs.

  during  the  third  quarter  of  2000,  amr  repurchased  prior   to
scheduled maturity approximately $167 million in face value  of  long-
term  debt.   cash  from  operations  provided  the  funding  for  the
repurchases.

dallas love field

in  1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and
dallas  to build and operate dallas/fort worth airport (dfw),  a  bond
ordinance was enacted by both cities (the bond ordinance).   the  bond
ordinance  required  both  cities to direct all  scheduled  interstate
passenger  operations to dfw and was an integral  part  of  the  bonds
issued for the construction and operation of dfw.  in 1979, as part of
a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities
agreed  to  expand  the  scope of operations allowed  under  the  bond
ordinance  at  dallas'  love  field.   congress  enacted  the   wright
amendment  to  prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent
with   this   agreement.   the  wright  amendment  limited  interstate
operations  at love field to the four states contiguous to texas  (new
mexico,  oklahoma,  arkansas, and louisiana)  and  prohibited  through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter.  in 1997, without
the agreement of the cities, congress amended the wright amendment  by
(i)  adding  three states (kansas, mississippi, and  alabama)  to  the
perimeter  and  (ii)  removing  some  federal  restrictions  on  large
aircraft configured with 56 seats or fewer.

  from october 1997 through may 2000, american, the cities of fort worth
and dallas, and other parties were involved in litigation regarding flight
restrictions at love field.  on may 1, 2000, american commenced service
from love field to chicago and los angeles using fokker 100 aircraft
reconfigured to hold 56 seats. these flights depart from terminal space
leased from continental express on a short-term basis. on august 31, 2000,
american  commenced service from love field to new  york's  laguardia
airport  using  the  same facilities.  american is seeking  long-term
facilities  at love field from the city of dallas for its love  field
operations.  consultants for the city of dallas are drafting a master
plan for love field and expect to make recommendations to the city of
dallas by the end of november 2000.  as a result of the foregoing, an
increase in operations at love field and/or the inability of american
to  obtain  adequate facilities to compete effectively at love  field
could adversely impact american's business.

industry consolidation

two  competitors of the company, ual corporation and us airways group,
inc.,  recently  announced that they have entered  into  a  definitive
merger  agreement.  the company is considering its strategic  response
to the possibility of industry consolidation, and from time to time is
engaged   in  discussions  with  other  carriers  regarding  potential
significant business combinations and acquisitions of assets.  to date
these  discussions have not resulted in a definitive agreement between
the  company  and  any  other carrier to enter into  such  a  business
combination  or asset acquisition; however, there can be no  assurance
that the company will not enter into such a transaction in the future.
if  any  significant  airline industry consolidation  were  to  occur,
including   any   business  combination  involving  the   company   or
significant asset acquisition by the company, the financial  condition
and  prospects  of the company or the resulting corporation  could  be
materially different from those of the company currently.

forward-looking information

statements  in this report contain various forward-looking statements
within  the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933,  as
amended,  and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  represent  the  company's  expectations  or  beliefs
concerning  future  events.   when used in  this  report,  the  words
"expects,"  "plans,"  "anticipates,"  and  similar  expressions   are
intended to identify forward-looking statements.  all forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the
company  on  the  date  of this report.  the  company  undertakes  no
obligation  to  publicly  update  or  revise  any  forward-   looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future  events  or
otherwise.   forward-looking statements are subject to  a  number  of
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations.   additional  information concerning  these  and  other
factors  is  contained  in  the  company's  securities  and  exchange
commission filings, included but not limited to the form 10-k for the
year ended december 31, 1999.

item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from   the
information   provided  in  item  7a.  quantitative  and   qualitative
disclosures about market risk of the company's annual report  on  form
10-k for the year ended december 31, 1999 except as discussed below.

   based  on  projected  fuel  usage for the  next  twelve  months,  a
hypothetical  10 percent increase in the september 29, 2000  cost  per
gallon of fuel would result in an increase to american's aircraft fuel
expense of approximately $192 million for the next twelve months,  net
of  fuel  hedge  instruments outstanding at september 30,  2000.   the
change  in market risk from december 31, 1999 is due primarily to  the
increase  in  fuel prices.  as of september 30, 2000, the company  has
hedged   approximately  70  percent  of  its   remaining   2000   fuel
requirements   and  approximately  35  percent  of   its   2001   fuel
requirements.

  during  2000,  the company terminated interest rate swap  agreements
on   notional  amounts  of  approximately  $425  million   which   had
effectively  converted  a  portion of its  fixed-rate  obligations  to
floating-rate obligations. the cost of terminating these interest rate
swap agreements was not material and the impact of the termination  of
these interest rate swap agreements on the company's interest  rate
market risk was not significant.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
several  purported class action cases currently pending in the circuit
court  of  cook  county,  illinois.  in  wolens  et  al.  v.  american
airlines,  inc.  and  tucker  v. american airlines,  inc.  (hereafter,
"wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and attorneys' fees  claiming
that a change made to american's aadvantage program in may 1988, which
limited  the  number of seats available to participants travelling  on
certain  awards,  breached american's agreement  with  its  aadvantage
members.   (although the wolens complaint originally asserted  several
state  law  claims,  only  the plaintiffs' breach  of  contract  claim
remains   after  the  u.s.  supreme  court  ruled  that  the   airline
deregulation act preempted the other claims).  in gutterman et al.  v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs also seek
money  damages  and  attorneys' fees claiming that the  february  1995
increase  in the award mileage required to claim a certain  aadvantage
travel   award  breached  the  agreement  between  american  and   its
aadvantage  members.   on  june  23, 1998,  the  court  certified  the
gutterman case as a class action.

   in  february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs
reached  a  settlement of both lawsuits.  pursuant to  the  agreement,
american and the plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the
wolens  and  gutterman lawsuits for purposes of settlement.   further,
american and the wolens plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to  certify
a  wolens  class  of  aadvantage  members  who  had  at  least  35,000
unredeemed  aadvantage miles as of december 31,  1988.   in  addition,
american  and  the  gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask  the  court  to
decertify  the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman
class  of  aadvantage  members who as of december  31,  1993  (a)  had
redeemed  25,000  or  50,000 aadvantage miles for  certain  aadvantage
awards and/or (b) had between 4,700 and 24,999 unredeemed miles in his
or  her  account  that  were earned in 1992 or 1993.   depending  upon
certain  factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be  entitled
to   receive  certificates  entitling  them  to  mileage  off  certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

   as  part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens  and
gutterman  plaintiffs' attorneys fees and the cost  of  administering
the  settlement, which amounts were accrued as of december 31,  1999.
in consideration for the relief provided in the settlement agreement,
wolens  and  gutterman class members will release american  from  all
claims  arising  from  any  changes that american  has  made  to  the
aadvantage  program and reaffirming american's right to make  changes
to  the aadvantage program in the future.  on may 2, 2000, the  court
preliminarily  approved the settlement and authorized sending  notice
of the settlement to class members.  on september 28, 2000, the court
heard  arguments from a number of class members who are objecting  to
various  terms  of the settlement.  the court did  not  rule  on  the
merits  of any objections, and therefore has not yet decided  whether
it will finally approve the settlement agreement.

   on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was  filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on  behalf  of passengers who paid it, as well as  interest  and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998, continental,  delta,  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff appealed and on march 30, 2000, the texas  court  of
appeals  in  austin affirmed the granting of defendants'  motion  for
summary judgment.  on august 17, 2000, the texas supreme court denied
the plaintiff's petition for review.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

   on  may  20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo  shippers adversely affected by a labor  disagreement  that
disrupted operations in february 1999 were consolidated in the  united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
although  american  was  named  as a defendant,  plaintiffs  were  not
seeking  to  hold american independently liable.  instead,  plaintiffs
named  american  as a defendant because american has a  $45.5  million
judgment against the apa, the value of which is believed to exceed the
apa's  total  assets.   the apa moved to dismiss  all  claims  alleged
against it, and on september 26, 2000, the court dismissed all of  the
plaintiffs' claims against the apa.  in so doing, however,  the  court
refused  to  dismiss  certain  state law claims  with  prejudice,  but
instead  concluded that these state law claims were not  preempted  by
federal  law and could proceed in a state court.  on october 3,  2000,
plaintiffs filed a complaint in texas state court against the apa.  in
the  complaints, plaintiffs allege that in the event the apa does  not
have  enough  assets to satisfy american's $45.5 million judgment  and
any  judgment  the  plaintiffs' recover, any judgment  in  their  case
should  be  considered equal to or superior to american's interest  in
the  $45.5  million  judgment against the apa.   american  intends  to
vigorously defend all claims against it in this action.

   on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american
airlines,  inc.,  amr  eagle holding corporation,  airlines  reporting
corporation,  and the sabre group holdings, inc. in the united  states
district  court  for  the  central  district  of  california,  western
division  (westways  world travel, inc. v. amr corp.,  et  al.).   the
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between  american
and  american eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt  organizations
act  of 1970 (rico).  the as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay monies to  american
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from july 26, 1995  to  the
present.   plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin american  from  enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus  treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  defendants'
motion  to  dismiss  all  claims  is  pending.   american  intends  to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.

   on  may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct.   the
case  has  been  set for trial on may 22, 2001.  american  intends  to
defend the lawsuit vigorously.

   between  may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to the present.  on november 10, 1999, the district court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
department  of  justice.   as a result, to  date  no  class  has  been
certified.  american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

   on  march  1, 2000, american was served with a federal  grand  jury
subpoena  calling for american to produce documents  relating  to  de-
icing  operations at dfw since 1992.  american has produced  documents
to  the  grand jury, but is not able at this time to determine  either
the full scope of the grand jury's investigation or american's role in
the  investigation.   american intends to  cooperate  fully  with  the
government's investigation.

industry consolidation

two  competitors of the company, ual corporation and us airways group,
inc.,  recently  announced that they have entered  into  a  definitive
merger  agreement.  the company is considering its strategic  response
to the possibility of industry consolidation, and from time to time is
engaged   in  discussions  with  other  carriers  regarding  potential
significant business combinations and acquisitions of assets.  to date
these  discussions have not resulted in a definitive agreement between
the  company  and  any  other carrier to enter into  such  a  business
combination  or asset acquisition; however, there can be no  assurance
that the company will not enter into such a transaction in the future.
if  any  significant  airline industry consolidation  were  to  occur,
including   any   business  combination  involving  the   company   or
significant asset acquisition by the company, the financial  condition
and  prospects  of the company or the resulting corporation  could  be
materially different from those of the company currently.

forward-looking information

statements  in this report contain various forward-looking statements
within  the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933,  as
amended,  and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  represent  the  company's  expectations  or  beliefs
concerning  future  events.   when used in  this  report,  the  words
"expects,"  "plans,"  "anticipates,"  and  similar  expressions   are
intended to identify forward-looking statements.  all forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the
company  on  the  date  of this report.  the  company  undertakes  no
obligation  to  publicly  update  or  revise  any  forward-   looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future  events  or
otherwise.   forward-looking statements are subject to  a  number  of
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations.   additional  information concerning  these  and  other
factors  is  contained  in  the  company's  securities  and  exchange
commission filings, included but not limited to the form 10-k for the
year ended december 31, 1999.

item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from   the
information   provided  in  item  7a.  quantitative  and   qualitative
disclosures about market risk of the company's annual report  on  form
10-k for the year ended december 31, 1999 except as discussed below.

   based  on  projected  fuel  usage for the  next  twelve  months,  a
hypothetical  10 percent increase in the september 29, 2000  cost  per
gallon of fuel would result in an increase to american's aircraft fuel
expense of approximately $192 million for the next twelve months,  net
of  fuel  hedge  instruments outstanding at september 30,  2000.   the
change  in market risk from december 31, 1999 is due primarily to  the
increase  in  fuel prices.  as of september 30, 2000, the company  has
hedged   approximately  70  percent  of  its   remaining   2000   fuel
requirements   and  approximately  35  percent  of   its   2001   fuel
requirements.

  during  2000,  the company terminated interest rate swap  agreements
on   notional  amounts  of  approximately  $425  million   which   had
effectively  converted  a  portion of its  fixed-rate  obligations  to
floating-rate obligations. the cost of terminating these interest rate
swap agreements was not material and the impact of the termination  of
these interest rate swap agreements on the company's interest  rate
market risk was not significant.

                      part ii:  other information


item 1.  legal proceedings

in  connection with its frequent flyer program, american was  sued  in
several  purported class action cases currently pending in the circuit
court  of  cook  county,  illinois.  in  wolens  et  al.  v.  american
airlines,  inc.  and  tucker  v. american airlines,  inc.  (hereafter,
"wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and attorneys' fees  claiming
that a change made to american's aadvantage program in may 1988, which
limited  the  number of seats available to participants travelling  on
certain  awards,  breached american's agreement  with  its  aadvantage
members.   (although the wolens complaint originally asserted  several
state  law  claims,  only  the plaintiffs' breach  of  contract  claim
remains   after  the  u.s.  supreme  court  ruled  that  the   airline
deregulation act preempted the other claims).  in gutterman et al.  v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs also seek
money  damages  and  attorneys' fees claiming that the  february  1995
increase  in the award mileage required to claim a certain  aadvantage
travel   award  breached  the  agreement  between  american  and   its
aadvantage  members.   on  june  23, 1998,  the  court  certified  the
gutterman case as a class action.

   in  february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs
reached  a  settlement of both lawsuits.  pursuant to  the  agreement,
american and the plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the
wolens  and  gutterman lawsuits for purposes of settlement.   further,
american and the wolens plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to  certify
a  wolens  class  of  aadvantage  members  who  had  at  least  35,000
unredeemed  aadvantage miles as of december 31,  1988.   in  addition,
american  and  the  gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask  the  court  to
decertify  the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman
class  of  aadvantage  members who as of december  31,  1993  (a)  had
redeemed  25,000  or  50,000 aadvantage miles for  certain  aadvantage
awards and/or (b) had between 4,700 and 24,999 unredeemed miles in his
or  her  account  that  were earned in 1992 or 1993.   depending  upon
certain  factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be  entitled
to   receive  certificates  entitling  them  to  mileage  off  certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

   as  part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens  and
gutterman  plaintiffs' attorneys fees and the cost  of  administering
the  settlement, which amounts were accrued as of december 31,  1999.
in consideration for the relief provided in the settlement agreement,
wolens  and  gutterman class members will release american  from  all
claims  arising  from  any  changes that american  has  made  to  the
aadvantage  program and reaffirming american's right to make  changes
to  the aadvantage program in the future.  on may 2, 2000, the  court
preliminarily  approved the settlement and authorized sending  notice
of the settlement to class members.  on september 28, 2000, the court
heard  arguments from a number of class members who are objecting  to
various  terms  of the settlement.  the court did  not  rule  on  the
merits  of any objections, and therefore has not yet decided  whether
it will finally approve the settlement agreement.

   on  august  7,  1998, a purported class action was  filed  against
american  airlines in state court in travis county, texas (boon  ins.
agency  v.  american airlines, inc., et al.) claiming  that  the  $75
reissuance   fee  for  changes  to  non-refundable  tickets   is   an
unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking a refund  of  the
fee  on  behalf  of passengers who paid it, as well as  interest  and
attorneys'  fees.   on  september 23, 1998, continental,  delta,  and
america west were added as defendants to the lawsuit.  on february 2,
1999, prior to any discovery being taken and a class being certified,
the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment holding
that  plaintiff's  claims are preempted by the  airline  deregulation
act.   plaintiff appealed and on march 30, 2000, the texas  court  of
appeals  in  austin affirmed the granting of defendants'  motion  for
summary judgment.  on august 17, 2000, the texas supreme court denied
the plaintiff's petition for review.

                                part ii


item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

   on  may  20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against  the
allied  pilots  association (apa) seeking compensation for  passengers
and  cargo  shippers adversely affected by a labor  disagreement  that
disrupted operations in february 1999 were consolidated in the  united
states  district  court  for the northern district  of  texas,  dallas
division  (in  re allied pilots association class action  litigation).
although  american  was  named  as a defendant,  plaintiffs  were  not
seeking  to  hold american independently liable.  instead,  plaintiffs
named  american  as a defendant because american has a  $45.5  million
judgment against the apa, the value of which is believed to exceed the
apa's  total  assets.   the apa moved to dismiss  all  claims  alleged
against it, and on september 26, 2000, the court dismissed all of  the
plaintiffs' claims against the apa.  in so doing, however,  the  court
refused  to  dismiss  certain  state law claims  with  prejudice,  but
instead  concluded that these state law claims were not  preempted  by
federal  law and could proceed in a state court.  on october 3,  2000,
plaintiffs filed a complaint in texas state court against the apa.  in
the  complaints, plaintiffs allege that in the event the apa does  not
have  enough  assets to satisfy american's $45.5 million judgment  and
any  judgment  the  plaintiffs' recover, any judgment  in  their  case
should  be  considered equal to or superior to american's interest  in
the  $45.5  million  judgment against the apa.   american  intends  to
vigorously defend all claims against it in this action.

   on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american
airlines,  inc.,  amr  eagle holding corporation,  airlines  reporting
corporation,  and the sabre group holdings, inc. in the united  states
district  court  for  the  central  district  of  california,  western
division  (westways  world travel, inc. v. amr corp.,  et  al.).   the
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between  american
and  american eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt  organizations
act  of 1970 (rico).  the as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay monies to  american
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from july 26, 1995  to  the
present.   plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin american  from  enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus  treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  defendants'
motion  to  dismiss  all  claims  is  pending.   american  intends  to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.

   on  may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division
of the department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines,
inc.,  and amr eagle holding corporation in federal court in  wichita,
kansas.  the  lawsuit alleges that american unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
dallas/fort  worth  international airport (dfw) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching these  new
competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints
on  american  to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct.   the
case  has  been  set for trial on may 22, 2001.  american  intends  to
defend the lawsuit vigorously.

   between  may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were  filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and  amr
eagle  holding  corporation in the united  states  district  court  in
wichita,  kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees.
(king  v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et al.; team electric
v.  amr  corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.;  wright v. amr corp., et al.; and  youngdahl  v.  amr
corp.,  et  al.).  collectively, these lawsuits allege  that  american
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize  airline  passenger
service  to  and  from dfw by increasing service when new  competitors
began flying to dfw, and by matching these new competitors' fares. two
of  the  suits (smith and wright) also allege that american unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. the suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on american into or out of dfw  since
1995  to the present.  on november 10, 1999, the district court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
department  of  justice.   as a result, to  date  no  class  has  been
certified.  american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

   on  march  1, 2000, american was served with a federal  grand  jury
subpoena  calling for american to produce documents  relating  to  de-
icing  operations at dfw since 1992.  american has produced  documents
to  the  grand jury, but is not able at this time to determine  either
the full scope of the grand jury's investigation or american's role in
the  investigation.   american intends to  cooperate  fully  with  the
government's investigation.
