management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations


results of operations

total revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1994 were essentially level
with the same period of the prior year.  micrographics service revenues
however, were up $4.4 million, or, 7%, largely as a result of the acquisition
of 14 data centers from national business systems which was effective january
3, 1994.  maintenance service revenues were up 3% and magnetic media sales were
up 4%.  com system sales and supply sales were down 2% and 9%, respectively,
due primarily to decreased shipments in the oem channel.

service revenues generated a gross profit margin of 31% for the six months,
down from 32% in the same period of the prior year.  the decline is due to
transition expenses incurred in assimilating the data center customers acquired
from nbs.  equipment and supply sales generated a gross profit margin of 29%
compared to 30% in the prior year.  the reduced margin results largely from
reduced com system and reader printer shipments and the resulting impact on
manufacturing costs.

selling, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 16% of total revenues
for both years.

the financial statements reflect the company's adoption of the financial
accounting standards board statement no. 109, "accounting for income taxes", as
discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.  the march 31,
1994 balance sheet includes a $34 million deferred tax asset and the
consolidated statements of operations include a $8 million one time adjustment
reflecting the cumulative effect on prior years of this accounting change.

liquidity and capital resources

working capital amounted to $17.4 million at march 31, 1994 compared to $30.9
million at september 30, 1993.  the decrease is mainly due to improved
inventory turnover ratios.  as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash
flows, net cash provided by operating activities improved $1.5 in the first six
months of fiscal year 1994 compared to the first six months of fiscal 1993.
net cash used in investing activities increased $6.0 million because of the
acquisition of data centers from national business systems.  net cash used in
financing activities was reduced $25.2 million reflecting lower paydowns on the
company's revolving line of credit and contributing to the year to year
increase in cash balances of $15.9 million.  the company believes that
operating cash flow in 1994 will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for
capital expenditures, debt repayments, and other obligations.
