securities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities act, regarding our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. however, these are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements. although such forward-looking statements reflect our good faith
judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us.
consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and
actual outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the
forward-looking statements. further information about the risks and uncertainties that may impact
us are described under item 1arisk factors in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended
december 31, 2006. you should read those sections carefully. you should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. we
undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance occurring after the date of this quarterly report or currently unknown facts
or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events.
