amr corporation
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
     been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     for interim financial information and with the instructions to form 10-q
     and article 10 of regulation s-x. accordingly, they do not include all of
     the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
     principles for complete financial statements. in the opinion of management,
     these financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal
     recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position,
     results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. the results
     of operations and cash flows for sabre holdings corporation (sabre) have
     been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial
     statements for the three months ended march 31, 2000. results of operations
     for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results
     of operations for the entire year. for further information, refer to the
     consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the amr
     corporation (amr or the company) annual report on form 10-k for the year
     ended december 31, 2000. certain amounts from 2000 have been reclassified
     to conform with the 2001 presentation.

2.   accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at march 31, 2001
     and december 31, 2000, was $8.6 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.
     accumulated amortization of equipment and property under capital leases at
     march 31, 2001 and december 31, 2000, was $1.2 billion.

3.   as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included
     in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31,
     2000, the miami international airport authority is currently remediating
     various environmental conditions at the miami international airport (the
     airport) and funding the remediation costs through landing fee revenues and
     other cost recovery methods. future costs of the remediation effort may be
     borne by carriers operating at the airport, including american, through
     increased landing fees and/or other charges since certain of the
     potentially responsible parties are no longer in business. the future
     increase in landing fees and/or other charges may be material but cannot be
     reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent
     of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost
     that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and
     uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately
     supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. in
     addition, the company is subject to environmental issues at various other
     airport and non-airport locations. management believes, after considering a
     number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these environmental
     issues is not expected to materially affect the company's consolidated
     financial position, results of operations or cash flows. amounts recorded
     for environmental issues are based on the company's current assessments of
     the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease as these
     assessments change.

4.   as of march 31, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following
     aircraft: 62 boeing 737-800s, 23 boeing 757-200s, 16 boeing 777-200ers, 145
     embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of all
     aircraft continue through 2006. payments for all aircraft will approximate
     $2.1 billion during the remainder of 2001, $1.7 billion in 2002, $950
     million in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in 2004
     through 2006.

5.   on january 10, 2001, the company announced three transactions that would
     substantially increase the scope of its existing network. the first of
     these transactions was consummated on april 9, 2001 when the company
     purchased substantially all of the assets of trans world airlines, inc.
     (twa) for approximately $625 million in cash (subject to certain working
     capital adjustments), including the satisfaction of $312 million in
     debtor-in-possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities. the
     company funded the acquisition of twa's assets with its existing cash and
     short-term investments.

     as a result of the three transactions announced on january 10, 2001, and
     for several other reasons, american airlines, inc. (american) and american
     eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet types in
     accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 121,
     "accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived
     assets to be disposed of." this review, which is expected to be completed
     during the second quarter of 2001, could result in an impairment charge to
     be taken by the company. the size of resulting 2001 charge is not presently
     known, but may be significant.

6.   effective january 1, 2001, the company adopted statement of financial
     accounting standards no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and
     hedging activities", as amended (sfas 133). sfas 133 requires the company
     to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
     derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
     income. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
     changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the
     change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
     through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
     hedged item is recognized in earnings. the ineffective portion of a
     derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in
     earnings. the adoption of sfas 133 did not result in a cumulative effect
     adjustment being recorded to net income for the change in accounting.
     however, the company recorded a transition adjustment of approximately $64
     million (net of tax of $38 million) in accumulated other comprehensive
     income in the first quarter of 2001.

     fuel price risk management

     american enters into fuel swap and option contracts to protect against
     increases in jet fuel prices. these instruments generally have maturities
     of up to 36 months. in accordance with sfas 133, the company accounts for
     its fuel swap and option contracts as cash flow hedges. upon the adoption
     of sfas 133, the company recorded the fair value of its fuel hedging
     contracts in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive income on the
     consolidated balance sheets. effective gains or losses on fuel hedging
     agreements are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are
     recognized in earnings as a component of fuel expense when the underlying
     fuel being hedged is used. the ineffective portion of the fuel hedge
     agreements is calculated as the excess of the change in the fuel hedge
     agreements intrinsic value relative to the change in the value of the fuel
     being hedged. in calculating the ineffective portion of the fuel hedge
     instrument, the company excludes the time value component related to any
     option premiums paid. the time value component related to any option
     premiums is recognized in earnings during the life of the contract. both
     the ineffective portion and time value component of the fuel hedge
     agreements are recognized as a component of sfas 133 adjustments on the
     consolidated statements of operations.

     for the three months ended march 31, 2001, the company recognized hedging
     gains of approximately $47 million on fuel used during such period, which
     are classified in fuel expense on the accompanying consolidated statements
     of operations. in addition, for the three months ended march 31, 2001, the
     company recorded a $21 million loss which is classified as sfas 133
     adjustments on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. this
     amount consists of a $31 million loss relating to time value, partially
     offset by a $10 million gain relating to the ineffectiveness of the fuel
     hedging agreements. the fair value of the company's fuel hedging agreements
     at march 31, 2001, representing the amount the company would receive to
     terminate the agreements, totaled $202 million.

     interest rate risk management

     american utilizes interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert a
     portion of its fixed-rate obligations to floating-rate obligations. under
     sfas 133, the company accounts for its interest rate swap contracts as fair
     value hedges whereby the fair value of the related interest rate swap
     agreement is reflected in other assets with the corresponding liability
     being recorded as a component of long-term debt on the consolidated balance
     sheets. the company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its interest rate
     swap contracts as each interest rate swap agreement meets the criteria for
     accounting under the short-cut method as defined in sfas 133 for fair value
     hedges of debt instruments.

     foreign exchange risk management

     to hedge against the risk of future exchange rate fluctuations on a portion
     of american's foreign cash flows, the company enters into various currency
     put option agreements on a number of foreign currencies. in accordance with
     sfas 133, the company accounts for its currency put option agreements as
     cash flow hedges. upon the adoption of sfas 133, the company recorded the
     fair value of its foreign currency put option agreements in other assets
     and accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance
     sheets. effective gains and loss on currency put option agreements are
     deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
     earnings as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying hedged
     revenues are recognized. the time value component related to any option
     premiums is recognized in earnings during the life of the contract as a
     component of passenger revenue. the company has no ineffectiveness with
     regard to its currency put option agreements.

     the company has entered into japanese yen currency exchange agreements to
     effectively convert certain yen-based lease obligations into dollar-based
     obligations. under sfas 133, the company accounts for its japanese yen
     currency exchange agreements as cash flow hedges whereby the fair value of
     the related japanese yen currency exchange agreements is reflected in other
     assets and accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated
     balance sheets. the company has no ineffectiveness with regard to its
     japanese yen currency exchange agreements.

7.   effective after the close of business on march 15, 2000, amr distributed
     0.722652 shares of sabre class a common stock for each share of amr stock
     owned by amr's shareholders. the record date for the dividend of sabre
     stock was the close of business on march 1, 2000. in addition, on february
     18, 2000, sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of $675 million to
     shareholders of record of sabre common stock at the close of business on
     february 15, 2000. based upon its approximate 83 percent interest in sabre,
     amr received approximately $559 million of this dividend. the dividend of
     amr's entire ownership interest in sabre's common stock resulted in a
     reduction to amr's retained earnings in march of 2000 equal to the carrying
     value of the company's investment in sabre on march 15, 2000, which
     approximated $581 million.

     as of march 31, 2001, the company estimates during the next twelve months
     it will reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income into
     earnings approximately $63 million (net of tax of $38 million) relating to
     its derivative financial instruments.

10.  during 2001, american and american eagle entered into various debt
     agreements which are secured by aircraft. effective interest rates on these
     agreements are based on libor plus a spread and mature over various periods
     of time, ranging from 2013 to 2021. as of march 31, 2001, the company had
     borrowed approximately $604 million under these agreements.

11.  in april 2001, the board of directors of american approved the guarantee by
     american of amr's existing  debt obligations. as such, american will
     unconditionally guarantee through the life of the related obligations
     approximately $900 million of unsecured debt, approximately $700 million of
     secured debt and approximately $1.6 billion of special facility revenue
     bonds issued by municipalities.

item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000

summary amr's loss from continuing operations during the first quarter of 2001
was $43 million, or $0.28 loss per share, as compared to income from continuing
operations of $89 million, or $0.57 per share diluted, for the same period in
2000. amr's operating income of $17 million decreased $195 million compared to
the same period in 2000.

the company's revenues increased $183 million, or 4.0 percent, in the first
quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. american's passenger revenues
increased by 4.3 percent, or $161 million. american's yield (the average amount
one passenger pays to fly one mile) of 14.88 cents increased by 6.7 percent
compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields increased 6.6 percent from
the first quarter of 2000. international yields increased 6.8 percent, primarily
due to an increase of 7.9 percent and 7.1 percent in european and latin american
yields, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0
percent in pacific yields. yields were up year-over-year largely due to fare
increases enacted over the course of 2000.

american's traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms) decreased 2.1 percent to
26.5 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31, 2001. american's capacity or
available seat miles (asms) of 39.0 billion miles decreased 2.6 percent compared
to the first quarter of 2000. american's domestic traffic decreased 3.7 percent
on a capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 1.4
percent on a capacity decrease of 2.4 percent. the decrease in domestic traffic
was due to a slowing u.s. economy, softening the demand for air travel. the
increase in international traffic was driven by a 6.9 percent increase in
traffic to the pacific on a capacity decrease of 3.5 percent, a 0.7 percent
increase in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of 0.1 percent and a 0.9
percent increase in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 4.1
percent. the overall decrease in capacity was due primarily to the company's
more room throughout coach program, partially offset by an increase in the
number of aircraft.

the company's operating expenses increased 8.7 percent, or $378 million.
american's cost per asm increased 11.7 percent to 11.21 cents, partially driven
by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program.
adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 5.7
percent. wages, salaries and benefits increased 8.0 percent, or $129 million,
primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees,
contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's
labor contracts, partially offset by a decrease in provision for profit-sharing
of approximately $28 million. aircraft fuel expense increased 24.1 percent, or
$133 million, due to a 21.5 percent increase in the company's average price per
gallon and a 2.2 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption. the
increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $47 million recognized
during the first quarter of 2001 related to the company's fuel hedging program.
commissions to agents decreased 12.8 percent, or $33 million, despite an
increase of approximately 4.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to
the continued benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and
a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. other operating
expense increased 12.6 percent, or $101 million, due primarily to increases in
external contract maintenance, outsourced services, data processing, and travel
and incidental costs.

other income (expense), historically a net expense, increased $19 million, or
34.5 percent, due to an increase in interest income of $8 million, or 25.0
percent, relating primarily to the trans world airlines, inc. (twa)
debtor-in-possession financing which partially offsets approximately $21 million
of sfas 133 adjustments as a result of the company's ineffectiveness and
time-value adjustments associated with its fuel hedging program (see footnote 6
to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and an increase of $9
million in miscellaneous-net relating primarily to the write-down of certain
investments held by the company.

the effective tax rates for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000 were
based upon the operating results for such periods. as such, the effective tax
rates do not represent estimated annual effective tax rates.

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities in the three-month period ended march
31, 2001 was $19 million, a decrease of $502 million over the same period in
2000, due primarily to a decrease in the company's working capital and a
decrease in income from continuing operations. capital expenditures for the
first three months of 2001 were $847 million, and included the acquisition of
seven boeing 737-800s, four boeing 777-200ers and seven embraer 135 aircraft.
these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and
debt agreements.

     as of march 31, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following
aircraft: 62 boeing 737-800s, 23 boeing 757-200s, 16 boeing 777-200ers, 145
embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of all aircraft
continue through 2006. payments for all aircraft will approximate $2.1 billion
during the remainder of 2001, $1.7 billion in 2002, $950 million in 2003 and an
aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in 2004 through 2006. the company
expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures from the company's
existing cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash or new
financing depending upon market conditions and the company's evolving view of
its long-term needs.

other information

on january 10, 2001, the company announced three transactions that would
substantially increase the scope of its existing network. the first of these
transactions was consummated on april 9, 2001 when the company purchased
substantially all of the assets of twa for approximately $625 million in cash
(subject to certain working capital adjustments), including the satisfaction of
$312 million in debtor-in-possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities.
the company funded the acquisition of twa's assets with its existing cash and
short-term investments. the company does not expect the acquisition of twa to
have a significantly accretive or dilutive impact on the company's 2001
earnings. although twa has historically reported net losses and the acquisition
of twa will result in the incurrence of integration costs, the company expects
to realize certain synergies from the acquisition, including, among other
things, improved passenger revenues and a reduction in rental expense from the
renegotiated lease obligations.

     secondly, the company announced that it has agreed to acquire from united
airlines, inc. (united) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)
of us airways group, inc. (us airways) upon the consummation of the previously
announced merger between united and us airways. in addition to the acquisition
of these assets, american will lease a number of slots and gates from united so
that american may operate half of the northeast shuttle (new york/washington
dc/boston). united will operate the other half of the shuttle. for these assets,
american will pay approximately $1.2 billion in cash to united and assume
approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. the consummation of
these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed united/us
airways merger, which is no longer expected to occur in the second quarter of
2001. also, the acquisition of aircraft is dependent upon certain rights of
united to exclude aircraft from the transactions and also is generally dependent
upon a certain number of us airways' boeing 757 cockpit crew members
transferring to american's payroll.

     finally, american has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to enter
into an exclusive marketing agreement with, d.c. air, llc (dc air). american has
agreed to pay $82 million in cash for its ownership stake. american will have a
right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent stake in
dc air. american will also lease to dc air a certain number of fokker 100
aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a "wet lease"). these
wet leased aircraft will be used by dc air in its operations. dc air is the
first significant new entrant at ronald reagan washington national airport (dca)
in over a decade. dc air will acquire the assets needed to begin its dca
operations from united/us airways upon the consummation of the merger between
the two carriers. american's investment in dc air and the other arrangements
described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between
united and us airways and upon execution of definitive documentation between dc
air and united (which has not yet occurred).

     as a result of the above transactions, and for several other reasons,
american and american eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet
types in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 121,
"accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of." this review, which is expected to be completed during the
second quarter of 2001, could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the
company. the size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently known, but may
be significant.

forward-looking information

statements in this report contain various forward-looking statements within the
meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section
21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, which represent the
company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. when used in this
report, the words "expects," "plans," "anticipates," and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. all forward-looking statements
in this report are based upon information available to the company on the date
of this report. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward- looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations. additional information concerning these and other factors is
contained in the company's securities and exchange commission filings, included
but not limited to the form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2000.

item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided
in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the
company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2000,
except as discussed below.

     based on projected fuel usage for the next twelve months, including the
company's estimated fuel consumption for twa based upon twa's actual average
consumption for the twelve months ended september 30, 2000, a hypothetical 10
percent increase in the march 31, 2001 cost per gallon of fuel would result in
an increase to the company's aircraft fuel expense of approximately $204 million
for the next twelve months, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at march
31, 2001. the change in market risk from december 31, 2000 is due primarily to
the estimated fuel consumption of twa, partially offset by a decrease in fuel
prices. as of march 31, 2001, the company, including the estimated fuel
consumption of twa, has hedged approximately 40 percent of its remaining 2001
fuel requirements, 22 percent of its 2002 fuel requirements, and approximately
11 percent of its 2003 fuel requirements.

part ii:  other information

item 1.  legal proceedings

in connection with its frequent flyer program, american was sued in several
purported class action cases currently pending in the circuit court of cook
county, illinois. in wolens et al. v. american airlines, inc. and tucker v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and
attorneys' fees claiming that a change made to american's aadvantage program in
may 1988, which limited the number of seats available to participants traveling
on certain awards, breached american's agreement with its aadvantage members.
(although the wolens complaint originally asserted several state law claims,
only the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.s. supreme
court ruled that the airline deregulation act preempted the other claims). in
gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs
also seek money damages and attorneys' fees claiming that the february 1995
increase in the award mileage required to claim a certain aadvantage travel
award breached the agreement between american and its aadvantage members. on
june 23, 1998, the court certified the gutterman case as a class action.

     in february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs reached
a settlement of both lawsuits. pursuant to the agreement, american and the
plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the wolens and gutterman
lawsuits for purposes of settlement. further, american and the wolens plaintiffs
agreed to ask the court to certify a wolens class of aadvantage members who had
at least 35,000 unredeemed aadvantage miles as of december 31, 1988. in
addition, american and the gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to
decertify the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman class of
aadvantage members who as of december 31, 1993 (a) had redeemed 25,000 or 50,000
aadvantage miles for certain aadvantage awards and/or (b) had between 4,700 and
24,999 unredeemed miles in his or her account that were earned in 1992 or 1993.
depending upon certain factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be
entitled to receive certificates entitling them to mileage off certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

     as part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens and gutterman
plaintiffs' attorneys fees and the cost of administering the settlement, which
amounts were accrued as of december 31, 1999. in consideration for the relief
provided in the settlement agreement, wolens and gutterman class members will
release american from all claims arising from any changes that american has made
to the aadvantage program and reaffirming american's right to make changes to
the aadvantage program in the future. on may 2, 2000, the court preliminarily
approved the settlement and authorized sending notice of the settlement to class
members. on september 28, 2000 and february 23, 2001, the court has held several
hearings on the fairness of the settlement and the request for fees by the
plaintiffs' attorneys. the court has not yet ruled on these issues.

     on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american airlines, inc.,
amr eagle holding corporation, airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre
group holdings, inc. in the united states district court for the central
district of california, western division (westways world travel, inc. v. amr
corp., et al.). the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit
memos to american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between american and
american eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment, and (3)
violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico).
the as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will
be required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations
from july 26, 1995 to the present. plaintiffs seek to enjoin american from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. defendants' motion
to dismiss all claims is pending. american intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit. although the company believes that the litigation is without merit,
adverse court decisions could impose restrictions on american's ability to
respond to competitors, and american's business may be adversely impacted.

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

     on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division of the
department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr
eagle holding corporation in federal court in wichita, kansas. the lawsuit
alleges that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on
american to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. the case has been
set for trial on may 22, 2001. american intends to defend the lawsuit
vigorously.

     between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were
filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding
corporation in the united states district court in wichita, kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees. (king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et
al.; team electric v. amr corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier
v. amr corp., et al.; wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl v. amr corp.,
et al.). collectively, these lawsuits allege that american unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
by increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. two of the suits (smith and wright) also allege
that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions
on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering override
commissions to travel agents. the suits propose to certify several classes of
consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased tickets for air
travel on american into or out of dfw since 1995 to the present. on november 10,
1999, the district court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the
case brought by the department of justice. as a result, to date no class has
been certified. american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

     on march 1, 2000, american was served with a federal grand jury subpoena
calling for american to produce documents relating to de-icing operations at dfw
since 1992. american has produced documents to the grand jury, but is not able
at this time to determine either the full scope of the grand jury's
investigation or american's role in the investigation. american intends to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.

item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000

summary amr's loss from continuing operations during the first quarter of 2001
was $43 million, or $0.28 loss per share, as compared to income from continuing
operations of $89 million, or $0.57 per share diluted, for the same period in
2000. amr's operating income of $17 million decreased $195 million compared to
the same period in 2000.

the company's revenues increased $183 million, or 4.0 percent, in the first
quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. american's passenger revenues
increased by 4.3 percent, or $161 million. american's yield (the average amount
one passenger pays to fly one mile) of 14.88 cents increased by 6.7 percent
compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields increased 6.6 percent from
the first quarter of 2000. international yields increased 6.8 percent, primarily
due to an increase of 7.9 percent and 7.1 percent in european and latin american
yields, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0
percent in pacific yields. yields were up year-over-year largely due to fare
increases enacted over the course of 2000.

american's traffic or revenue passenger miles (rpms) decreased 2.1 percent to
26.5 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31, 2001. american's capacity or
available seat miles (asms) of 39.0 billion miles decreased 2.6 percent compared
to the first quarter of 2000. american's domestic traffic decreased 3.7 percent
on a capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 1.4
percent on a capacity decrease of 2.4 percent. the decrease in domestic traffic
was due to a slowing u.s. economy, softening the demand for air travel. the
increase in international traffic was driven by a 6.9 percent increase in
traffic to the pacific on a capacity decrease of 3.5 percent, a 0.7 percent
increase in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of 0.1 percent and a 0.9
percent increase in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 4.1
percent. the overall decrease in capacity was due primarily to the company's
more room throughout coach program, partially offset by an increase in the
number of aircraft.

the company's operating expenses increased 8.7 percent, or $378 million.
american's cost per asm increased 11.7 percent to 11.21 cents, partially driven
by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program.
adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 5.7
percent. wages, salaries and benefits increased 8.0 percent, or $129 million,
primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees,
contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's
labor contracts, partially offset by a decrease in provision for profit-sharing
of approximately $28 million. aircraft fuel expense increased 24.1 percent, or
$133 million, due to a 21.5 percent increase in the company's average price per
gallon and a 2.2 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption. the
increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $47 million recognized
during the first quarter of 2001 related to the company's fuel hedging program.
commissions to agents decreased 12.8 percent, or $33 million, despite an
increase of approximately 4.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to
the continued benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and
a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. other operating
expense increased 12.6 percent, or $101 million, due primarily to increases in
external contract maintenance, outsourced services, data processing, and travel
and incidental costs.

other income (expense), historically a net expense, increased $19 million, or
34.5 percent, due to an increase in interest income of $8 million, or 25.0
percent, relating primarily to the trans world airlines, inc. (twa)
debtor-in-possession financing which partially offsets approximately $21 million
of sfas 133 adjustments as a result of the company's ineffectiveness and
time-value adjustments associated with its fuel hedging program (see footnote 6
to the condensed consolidated financial statements) and an increase of $9
million in miscellaneous-net relating primarily to the write-down of certain
investments held by the company.

the effective tax rates for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000 were
based upon the operating results for such periods. as such, the effective tax
rates do not represent estimated annual effective tax rates.

liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities in the three-month period ended march
31, 2001 was $19 million, a decrease of $502 million over the same period in
2000, due primarily to a decrease in the company's working capital and a
decrease in income from continuing operations. capital expenditures for the
first three months of 2001 were $847 million, and included the acquisition of
seven boeing 737-800s, four boeing 777-200ers and seven embraer 135 aircraft.
these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and
debt agreements.

     as of march 31, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following
aircraft: 62 boeing 737-800s, 23 boeing 757-200s, 16 boeing 777-200ers, 145
embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of all aircraft
continue through 2006. payments for all aircraft will approximate $2.1 billion
during the remainder of 2001, $1.7 billion in 2002, $950 million in 2003 and an
aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in 2004 through 2006. the company
expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures from the company's
existing cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash or new
financing depending upon market conditions and the company's evolving view of
its long-term needs.

other information

on january 10, 2001, the company announced three transactions that would
substantially increase the scope of its existing network. the first of these
transactions was consummated on april 9, 2001 when the company purchased
substantially all of the assets of twa for approximately $625 million in cash
(subject to certain working capital adjustments), including the satisfaction of
$312 million in debtor-in-possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities.
the company funded the acquisition of twa's assets with its existing cash and
short-term investments. the company does not expect the acquisition of twa to
have a significantly accretive or dilutive impact on the company's 2001
earnings. although twa has historically reported net losses and the acquisition
of twa will result in the incurrence of integration costs, the company expects
to realize certain synergies from the acquisition, including, among other
things, improved passenger revenues and a reduction in rental expense from the
renegotiated lease obligations.

     secondly, the company announced that it has agreed to acquire from united
airlines, inc. (united) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)
of us airways group, inc. (us airways) upon the consummation of the previously
announced merger between united and us airways. in addition to the acquisition
of these assets, american will lease a number of slots and gates from united so
that american may operate half of the northeast shuttle (new york/washington
dc/boston). united will operate the other half of the shuttle. for these assets,
american will pay approximately $1.2 billion in cash to united and assume
approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. the consummation of
these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed united/us
airways merger, which is no longer expected to occur in the second quarter of
2001. also, the acquisition of aircraft is dependent upon certain rights of
united to exclude aircraft from the transactions and also is generally dependent
upon a certain number of us airways' boeing 757 cockpit crew members
transferring to american's payroll.

     finally, american has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to enter
into an exclusive marketing agreement with, d.c. air, llc (dc air). american has
agreed to pay $82 million in cash for its ownership stake. american will have a
right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent stake in
dc air. american will also lease to dc air a certain number of fokker 100
aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a "wet lease"). these
wet leased aircraft will be used by dc air in its operations. dc air is the
first significant new entrant at ronald reagan washington national airport (dca)
in over a decade. dc air will acquire the assets needed to begin its dca
operations from united/us airways upon the consummation of the merger between
the two carriers. american's investment in dc air and the other arrangements
described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between
united and us airways and upon execution of definitive documentation between dc
air and united (which has not yet occurred).

     as a result of the above transactions, and for several other reasons,
american and american eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet
types in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 121,
"accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of." this review, which is expected to be completed during the
second quarter of 2001, could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the
company. the size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently known, but may
be significant.

forward-looking information

statements in this report contain various forward-looking statements within the
meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section
21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, which represent the
company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. when used in this
report, the words "expects," "plans," "anticipates," and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. all forward-looking statements
in this report are based upon information available to the company on the date
of this report. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward- looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. forward-looking statements are subject to a number
of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations. additional information concerning these and other factors is
contained in the company's securities and exchange commission filings, included
but not limited to the form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2000.

item 3.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided
in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the
company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2000,
except as discussed below.

     based on projected fuel usage for the next twelve months, including the
company's estimated fuel consumption for twa based upon twa's actual average
consumption for the twelve months ended september 30, 2000, a hypothetical 10
percent increase in the march 31, 2001 cost per gallon of fuel would result in
an increase to the company's aircraft fuel expense of approximately $204 million
for the next twelve months, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at march
31, 2001. the change in market risk from december 31, 2000 is due primarily to
the estimated fuel consumption of twa, partially offset by a decrease in fuel
prices. as of march 31, 2001, the company, including the estimated fuel
consumption of twa, has hedged approximately 40 percent of its remaining 2001
fuel requirements, 22 percent of its 2002 fuel requirements, and approximately
11 percent of its 2003 fuel requirements.

county, illinois. in wolens et al. v. american airlines, inc. and tucker v.
american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and
attorneys' fees claiming that a change made to american's aadvantage program in
may 1988, which limited the number of seats available to participants traveling
on certain awards, breached american's agreement with its aadvantage members.
(although the wolens complaint originally asserted several state law claims,
only the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the u.s. supreme
court ruled that the airline deregulation act preempted the other claims). in
gutterman et al. v. american airlines, inc. (hereafter, "gutterman"), plaintiffs
also seek money damages and attorneys' fees claiming that the february 1995
increase in the award mileage required to claim a certain aadvantage travel
award breached the agreement between american and its aadvantage members. on
june 23, 1998, the court certified the gutterman case as a class action.

     in february 2000, american and the wolens and gutterman plaintiffs reached
a settlement of both lawsuits. pursuant to the agreement, american and the
plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the wolens and gutterman
lawsuits for purposes of settlement. further, american and the wolens plaintiffs
agreed to ask the court to certify a wolens class of aadvantage members who had
at least 35,000 unredeemed aadvantage miles as of december 31, 1988. in
addition, american and the gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to
decertify the existing gutterman class and to certify a new gutterman class of
aadvantage members who as of december 31, 1993 (a) had redeemed 25,000 or 50,000
aadvantage miles for certain aadvantage awards and/or (b) had between 4,700 and
24,999 unredeemed miles in his or her account that were earned in 1992 or 1993.
depending upon certain factors, wolens and gutterman class members will be
entitled to receive certificates entitling them to mileage off certain
aadvantage awards or dollars off certain american fares.

     as part of the settlement, american agreed to pay the wolens and gutterman
plaintiffs' attorneys fees and the cost of administering the settlement, which
amounts were accrued as of december 31, 1999. in consideration for the relief
provided in the settlement agreement, wolens and gutterman class members will
release american from all claims arising from any changes that american has made
to the aadvantage program and reaffirming american's right to make changes to
the aadvantage program in the future. on may 2, 2000, the court preliminarily
approved the settlement and authorized sending notice of the settlement to class
members. on september 28, 2000 and february 23, 2001, the court has held several
hearings on the fairness of the settlement and the request for fees by the
plaintiffs' attorneys. the court has not yet ruled on these issues.

     on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american airlines, inc.,
amr eagle holding corporation, airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre
group holdings, inc. in the united states district court for the central
district of california, western division (westways world travel, inc. v. amr
corp., et al.). the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit
memos to american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between american and
american eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment, and (3)
violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico).
the as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will
be required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations
from july 26, 1995 to the present. plaintiffs seek to enjoin american from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. defendants' motion
to dismiss all claims is pending. american intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit. although the company believes that the litigation is without merit,
adverse court decisions could impose restrictions on american's ability to
respond to competitors, and american's business may be adversely impacted.

item 1.  legal proceedings (continued)

     on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division of the
department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr
eagle holding corporation in federal court in wichita, kansas. the lawsuit
alleges that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on
american to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. the case has been
set for trial on may 22, 2001. american intends to defend the lawsuit
vigorously.

     between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were
filed against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding
corporation in the united states district court in wichita, kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees. (king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et
al.; team electric v. amr corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier
v. amr corp., et al.; wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl v. amr corp.,
et al.). collectively, these lawsuits allege that american unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
by increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. two of the suits (smith and wright) also allege
that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions
on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering override
commissions to travel agents. the suits propose to certify several classes of
consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased tickets for air
travel on american into or out of dfw since 1995 to the present. on november 10,
1999, the district court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the
case brought by the department of justice. as a result, to date no class has
been certified. american intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

     on march 1, 2000, american was served with a federal grand jury subpoena
calling for american to produce documents relating to de-icing operations at dfw
since 1992. american has produced documents to the grand jury, but is not able
at this time to determine either the full scope of the grand jury's
investigation or american's role in the investigation. american intends to
cooperate fully with the government's investigation.
