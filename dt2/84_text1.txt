                     management's discussion and analysis of
                  results of operations and financial condition

overview

at&amp;t; corporation (at&amp;t;) is among the world's communications leaders, providing
voice, data, video and broadband telecommunications services to large and small
businesses, consumers and government agencies. we provide domestic and
international long distance; regional, local and wireless communications
services; cable television and internet communications services. we also provide
directory and calling-card services to support our communications business.

tracking stocks

a tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders based
on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks.
ownership of shares of at&amp;t; common stock, at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock or
liberty media class a or b tracking stock does not represent a direct legal
interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but an ownership of
at&amp;t; in total. the specific shares represent an interest in the economic
performance of the net assets of each of the groups.

at&amp;t; wireless group is an integrated business of at&amp;t; and liberty media group is
a combination of certain assets and businesses of at&amp;t;, neither of which is a
stand-alone entity. as at&amp;t; wireless group and liberty media group are tracking
stocks of at&amp;t;, separate financial statements are not required to be filed. we
have provided the financial statements as exhibits to this document to provide
additional disclosures to investors to allow them to assess the financial
performance of at&amp;t; wireless group and liberty media group. since the tracking
stocks are governed by a common board of directors, the at&amp;t; board of directors
could make operational and financial decisions or implement policies that affect
disproportionately the businesses of any group. for example, our board of
directors may decide to transfer funds or to reallocate assets, liabilities,
revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups, without the consent of
shareholders. all actions by the board of directors are subject to the board
members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a group and not just to
holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our charter, policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.

our board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth in the
tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion of our
board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group agreement but
without approval of our shareholders. in addition, the fact that we have
separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests
of the holders of at&amp;t; common stock, at&amp;t; wireless group common stock and
liberty media group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
conflict. our board of directors would make any change or addition to the
policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, and
would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to at&amp;t; and all of our
shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interests
and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of
our shares.

you should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our board of
directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of a
tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.

restructuring of at&amp;t;

on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; announced a restructuring plan designed to fully
separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial
performance and economic value of each of at&amp;t;'s four major operating units.
upon completion of the plan, at&amp;t; wireless, at&amp;t; broadband, at&amp;t; business and
at&amp;t; consumer will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.

as part of the first phase of the restructuring plan, on april 18, 2001, at&amp;t;
announced details of an offer to exchange shares of at&amp;t; common stock for shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock. on the same date, at&amp;t; wireless services,
inc., filed its initial registration statement in connection with the planned
split-off. under the terms of the exchange offer, at&amp;t; will issue 1.176 shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock in exchange for each share of at&amp;t; common
stock validly tendered and not withdrawn, subject to specified conditions.
following the exchange offer and subject to receipt of specific conditions, at&amp;t;
plans to split-off at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t.; at&amp;t; intends to retain up to
$3 billion of at&amp;t; wireless shares for future sale, exchange or monetization
within six months following the split-off. we expect at&amp;t; wireless will become
an independent, publicly-held company in mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate
tax and other approvals.

in addition to the split-off of at&amp;t; wireless, we intend to fully separate or
issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial performance and economic
value of each of our other major business units. we plan to create and issue new
classes of stock to track the financial performance and economic value of our
at&amp;t; broadband unit and at&amp;t; consumer unit. we plan to sell some percentage of
shares of the at&amp;t; broadband unit in the fall of 2001. within 12 months of such
sale, we intend to completely separate at&amp;t; broadband from at&amp;t;, as an
asset-based stock. the at&amp;t; consumer tracking stock is expected to be fully
distributed to at&amp;t; shareowners in the second half of 2001.

at&amp;t; expects that these transactions will be tax-free to u.s. shareholders.
at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan is complicated and involves a substantial number of
steps and transactions, including obtaining various conditions, such as internal
revenue services rulings. in addition, future financial conditions, superior
alternatives or other factors may arise or occur that make it inadvisable to
proceed with part or all of at&amp;t;'s restructuring plans. any or all of the
elements of at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan may not occur as we currently expect or in
the timeframes that we currently contemplate, or at all. alternative forms of
restructuring, including sales of interests in these businesses, would reduce
what is available for distribution to shareholders in the restructuring.

on april 11, 2001, the internal revenue services ruled that the proposed
split-off of liberty media corporation, which will own all of the assets
reflected in the liberty media group (lmg), qualifies as a tax-free transaction
for at&amp;t;, liberty media and their shareowners. at&amp;t; acquired liberty media
through the acquisition of tele-communications, inc.(tci). at&amp;t; does not have a
controlling financial interest for financial accounting purposes in lmg;
therefore, our investment in lmg is accounted for under the equity method in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. the amounts attributable to lmg
are reflected as separate line items "equity earnings (losses) from liberty
media group" and "investment in liberty media group and related receivables,
net," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

by mid-2001, at&amp;t; plans to convert the lmg tracking stock into an asset-based
security and launch liberty media corporation as an independent,
publicly-traded company.

other matters.

these forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating
to the future business prospects, revenue, working capital, liquidity, capital
needs, network build out, interest costs and income, are necessarily estimates
reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number of risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those suggested by the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking
statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements including,
without limitation:

- -        the risks associated with the implementation of at&amp;t;'s restructuring
         plan, which is complicated and involves a substantial number of
         different transactions each with separate conditions, any or all of
         which may not occur as we currently intend, or which may not occur in
         the timeframe we currently expect,

- -        the risks associated with each of at&amp;t;'s main business units, operating
         as independent entities as opposed to as part of an integrated
         telecommunications provider following completion of at&amp;t;'s
         restructuring plan, including the inability of these groups to rely on
         the financial and operational resources of the combined company and
         these groups having to provide services that were previously provided
         by a different part of the combined company,

- -        the impact of existing and new competitors in the markets in which
         these groups compete, including competitors that may offer less
         expensive products and services, desirable or innovative products,
         technological substitutes, or have extensive resources or
         better financing.

- -        the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting from excessive
         deployment of network capacity,

- -        the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in the
         telecommunications industry, which trend may have the effect of making
         the competitors of these entities larger and better financed and afford
         these competitors with extensive resources and greater geographic
         reach, allowing them to compete more effectively,

- -        the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which the company
         operates, which may decrease prices charged, increase churn and change
         customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,

- -        the ability to enter into agreements to provide, and the cost of
         entering new markets necessary to provide, nationwide services,

- -        the ability to establish a significant market presence in new
         geographic and service markets,

- -        the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of
         increased leverage,

consolidated results of operations

the comparison of first quarter 2001 results with the first quarter of 2000 was
impacted by events, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that occurred during
these two years. for example, at year-end 2000, we acquired the wireless
property in los angeles as a result of the ab cellular redemption of at&amp;t;'s
equity interest in ab cellular. prior to that date, at&amp;t; held a 55.62% equity
interest in ab cellular with 50% voting interest and recorded the investment
under the equity method of accounting. the consolidation of the los angeles
property resulted in the inclusion of 100% of its results in each line item of
at&amp;t;'s consolidated balance sheet on december 31, 2000 and the results were also
included in at&amp;t;'s consolidated income statements starting january 2001. in
addition, in 2000, we acquired mediaone and wireless properties in the san
francisco bay area, which were both included in our first quarter 2001 results,
but were not included in the first quarter 2000 results.

year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of at home
corp. (excite@home) beginning september 1, 2000, due to corporate-governance
changes, which gave at&amp;t; a controlling interest. at that time and on march 31,
2001, we had an approximate 23% economic interest and 74% voting interest in
excite@home. the consolidation of excite@home resulted in the inclusion of 100%
of its results in each line item of at&amp;t;'s consolidated balance sheet and
consolidated income statement. the approximate 77% we do not own is reflected in
the march 31, 2001 and december 31, 2000 consolidated balance sheets within
"minority interest" and as a component of "minority interest income (expense)"
in the consolidated statement of income for the three months ended march 31,
2001. for the three months ended march 31, 2000, our ownership interest in
excite@home was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with
earnings or losses included as a component of "net losses from other equity
investments" in the consolidated statement of income.

effectively july 1, 2000, the federal communication commission (fcc) eliminated
primary interexchange carrier charges (picc or per-line charges) that at&amp;t; pays
for residential and single-line businesses. the elimination of these per-line
charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since at&amp;t;
has historically billed its customers for these charges.

total revenue increased 5.4%, or $0.9 billion, in the first quarter of 2001
compared with the prior year period. approximately $1.0 billion of the increase
is due to the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of excite@home
partially offset by the elimination of picc and dispositions. also contributing
to the revenue growth was wireless services, data and internet protocol (ip)
growth within business services and broadband. these increases were largely
offset by the accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue. we expect
long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing
competition and product substitution.

costs of services and products increased $0.9 billion, or 23.6%, in the first
quarter of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. approximately $0.7
billion of the increase was due to acquisitions, primarily mediaone, net of
dispositions, and the impact of consolidating excite@home. the higher costs
associated with new outsourcing contracts as well as our growing wireless
subscriber base increased expenses by approximately $0.2 billion. the higher
wireless expenses primarily related to higher costs of handsets sold due to an
increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 compared
with the same period in the prior year.

included within access and other connection expenses are costs that we pay to
connect calls on the facilities of other service providers. mandated reductions
in per-minute access costs and decreased per-line charges effective in the
second half of 2000 resulted in lower costs of approximately $0.5 billion. these
decreases were partially offset by approximately $0.2 billion of higher costs
due to volume increases, as well as higher universal service fund contributions.
since most of these charges are passed through to the customer, the per-minute
access-rate and per-line charge reductions and the universal service fund
contributions have generally resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.

wireless and broadband businesses drove approximately $0.3 billion of the

approximately $0.2 billion as a result of continued cost-control initiatives,

amortization of goodwill, franchise costs and other purchased intangibles
increased $0.5 billion to $0.8 billion, or 129.6%, in the first quarter of 2001

during the first quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; recorded $808 million of net
restructuring and other charges, which had an approximate $0.21 impact on basic
and diluted earnings per share. included in these charges was $739 million for
asset impairment charges related to excite@home, and $69 for restructuring and
exit costs which consisted of $59 million for cash severance costs, $6 million
related to facilities and $4 million related to termination of lease
obligations.

the asset impairment charges included $600 recorded by excite@home associated
with goodwill impairment of various acquisitions, primarily excite, and a
related goodwill impairment charge of $139 recorded by at&amp;t; associated with its
acquisition goodwill of excite@home. the impairment resulted from the continued
weakness of the online media market that excite@home operates in. since we
consolidate, but only own approximately 23% of excite@home, 77% of the charge
recorded by excite@home was not included as a reduction to at&amp;t;'s net income,
but rather eliminated in our march 31, 2001 consolidated statement of income as
"minority interest income (expense)."

the $59 million of cash severance costs were primarily recorded as a result of
synergies created by the mediaone merger related to approximately 2,350
employees. approximately 10% of the individuals were management employees and
90% were non-management employees. nearly 88% of the affected employees have
left their positions as of march 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
leave the company by the end of 2001.

this restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of
approximately $42 million in 2001 (net of severance benefit pay-outs of
approximately $59 million) and approximately $132 million per year thereafter,
as well as ebit savings of approximately $97 million in 2001 and approximately
$101 million per year thereafter. we expect increased spending in growth
businesses will largely offset these cash and ebit savings. the ebit savings,
primarily attributable to reduced personnel-related expenses, will be realized
in costs of services and products and sg&amp;a; expenses.

in the second quarter of 2001, we expect to incur additional restructuring
charges resulting from mediaone synergies and work force reductions at
excite@home.

during the first quarter of 2000, at&amp;t; recorded $773 million of net
restructuring and other charges, which included $682 million for restructuring
and exit costs associated with at&amp;t;'s initiative to reduce costs by the end of
2000, and $91 million related to the government-mandated disposition of at&amp;t;
communications (u.k.) ltd., which would have competed directly with concert.
<page>   45
included in restructuring and exit costs was $458 million of cash termination
benefits associated with the involuntary separation of approximately 6,200
employees. approximately one-half of the individuals were management employees
and one-half were non-management employees. nearly 60% of the affected employees
have left their positions as of march 31, 2001, and the remaining employees will
leave the company during 2001.

we also recorded $62 million of network lease and other contract termination
costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the
termination of these contracts during the quarter.

also included in restructuring and exit costs was $144 of benefit curtailment
costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit plans. we also
recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related to the write-down of
unrecoverable assets in certain businesses in which the carrying value is no
longer supported by future cash flows.

operating income decreased $1.4 billion, or 59.4%, in the first quarter of 2001
compared with the same period in 2000. the decrease was primarily due to the
impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of excite@home, which lowered
operating income by nearly $1.1 billion. a majority of the impact of operating
losses and the restructuring charge generated by excite@home was offset in
minority interest income (expense), reflecting the approximate 77% of
excite@home we do not own. also contributing to the decrease in operating income
was the impact of lower revenue in consumer services, and higher operating
expenses for advanced broadband services, including digital video, high-speed
data and broadband telephony, partially offset by restructuring charges, net of
asset impairment, recorded in the first quarter of 2000.

with the adoption of sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities," we reclassified certain investment securities, which
support debt that is indexed to those securities, from "available-for-sale" to
"trading." as a result of the reclassification, we recorded a pretax charge of
$2.6 billion. also contributing to the increase in expense were lower net gains
on sale of businesses and investments of approximately $0.4 billion.

first quarter of 2001 compared with an expense of $0.5 billion in the first
quarter of 2000. the decrease in expense was primarily due to a net loss before
income taxes in the first quarter of 2001, compared with earnings before income
taxes in the first quarter of 2000. the effective tax rate for the quarter was
13.9%, compared with 20.5% for the first quarter of 2000. the first quarter 2001
effective tax rate was impacted by a charge associated with the adoption of sfas
no. 133, as well as a non tax-deductible asset impairment charge recorded
related to excite@home. the first quarter of 2001 effective tax rate was also
negatively impacted by the consolidation of operational losses of excite@home,
which is unable to record tax benefits on its pretax losses, and higher non
tax-deductible goodwill amortization. the first quarter 2000 effective tax rate
was positively impacted by a tax-free gain resulting from an exchange of at&amp;t;
stock for an entity owning certain cable-systems and other assets with cox, and
the benefit of the write-off of the related deferred tax liability.

minority interest income (expense), which is recorded net of income taxes,
represents an adjustment to at&amp;t;'s income to reflect the less than 100%
ownership of consolidated subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
issued by subsidiaries of at&amp;t.; the $0.7 billion decrease in minority interest
for the first quarter ended march 31, 2001, as compared with the corresponding
prior-year period resulted from the consolidation of excite@home effective
september 1, 2000. the minority interest income in 2001 primarily reflects
losses generated by excite@home, including an asset impairment charge that were
attributable to the approximate 77% of excite@home not owned by at&amp;t.; the income
tax benefit recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $87 million and
$26 million for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

equity losses from lmg, which are recorded net of income taxes , were $0.7

the same period in 2000. the decline was primarily due to lower gains on

that lmg had investments in. gains were recorded for the difference between the
carrying value of lmg's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of
securities received in the merger. in addition, the impairment charges recorded
on lmg's investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value also
contributed to the decline. these were partially offset by tax benefits recorded

net losses from other equity investments, which were recorded net of income

offset by higher losses from its normal business operations. partially
offsetting these decreases were higher equity losses from various investments

relating to the revaluation of certain securities reclassified from

segment results

in support of the services we provide, we segment our results by the business
units that support our primary lines of business: business services, consumer
services, wireless services and broadband. the balance of at&amp;t;'s operations,
excluding lmg is included in a corporate and other category. although not a
segment, we also discuss the results of lmg.

the discussion of segment results includes revenue; ebit (earnings before
interest, taxes, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend
requirements on preferred stock); ebitda [ebit excluding depreciation and
amortization, and minority interest (expense) income other than excite@home's
minority (expense) interest]; total assets, and capital additions. the
discussion of ebitda for wireless services and broadband is modified to exclude
other income and net losses from equity investments. total assets for each
segment generally include all assets, except intercompany receivables. however,
our wireless services segment included intercompany receivables from at&amp;t; and
the related interest income since these assets relate to the results of the at&amp;t;
wireless group tracked business. prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or
leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level, and therefore are
included in the corporate and other group. capital additions for each segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, acquisitions of
licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
and additions to internal-use software.

ebit is the primary measure used by at&amp;t;'s chief operating decision makers to
measure at&amp;t;'s operating results and to measure segment profitability and
performance. at&amp;t; calculates ebit as earnings before interest, taxes, the
cumulative effect of accounting changes and dividend requirements on preferred
stock. in addition, management also uses ebitda as a measure of segment
profitability and performance, and is defined as ebit, excluding depreciation
and amortization, minority interest (expense) income other than excite@home's
minority (expense) interest. interest and taxes are not factored into the
<page>   49
segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision makers;
therefore, trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis.
management believes ebit is meaningful to investors because it provides analysis
of operating results using the same measures used by at&amp;t;'s chief operating
decision makers and provides a return on total capitalization measure. we
believe ebitda is meaningful to investors as a measure of each segment's
liquidity consistent with the measure utilized by our chief operating decision
makers. in addition, we believe that both ebit and ebitda allow investors a
means to evaluate the financial results of each segment in relation to total
at&amp;t.; ebit for at&amp;t; was deficit of $1.1 billion and earning of $2.7 billion for
the quarters ended march 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. ebitda for at&amp;t; was
$1.9 billion and $4.8 billion for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. our calculation of ebit and ebitda may or may not be
consistent with the calculation of these measures by other public companies.
ebit and ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally
accepted accounting principles (gaap) measures of income as a measure of
performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
as a measure of liquidity. in addition, ebitda does not take into account
changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which
can affect cash flow.

in connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late 2000,
our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes enacted since the
publication of our 2000 annual results. the changes are as follows: the business
services segment was expanded to include the results of international operations
and ventures. in addition, certain corporate costs that were previously recorded
within the corporate and other group have been allocated to the respective
segments in an effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect
all direct corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services. all prior
period results have been restated to reflect these changes. total assets for our
reportable segments generally include all asset, except intercompany
receivables. however, our wireless services segment included intercompany
receivables from at&amp;t; and the related interest income since these assets relate
to the results of the at&amp;t; wireless group tracked businesses.

reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continuously review our management
model and structure, which may result in additional adjustments to our operating
segments in the future. in addition, when we create tracking stocks for our
consumer and broadband units, we will begin allocating `pure' corporate overhead
to these units. see note (b) for further detail on our restructuring plan.

business services

our business services segment offers a variety of global communications
services, including long distance, local, and data and ip networking to small
and medium-sized businesses, large domestic and multinational businesses and
government agencies. business services is also a provider of voice, data and ip

business services includes at&amp;t; solutions, the company's professional-services
outsourcing business, which provides seamless solutions that maximize the
competitive advantage of networking-based electronic applications for global
clients. at&amp;t; solutions also provides e-infrastructure and high-availability
services to enterprise clients, and manages at&amp;t;'s unified global network.
business services also includes the results of international ventures
and operations.

revenue

business services revenue declined $0.1 billion, or 1.2%, in the first quarter
of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. the decrease was primarily due
to a decline in long distance voice revenue of approximately $0.5 billion,
offset by growth in data/ip of approximately $0.4 billion.

long distance voice services revenue declined at a low-teens percentage rate in
the first quarter due to a declining average price per minute reflecting the
competitive forces within the industry that are expected to continue. partially
offsetting this decline was a mid single-digit percentage growth rate
in minutes.

data services, which represent the transportation of data, rather than voice,
along our network, grew at a high-teens percentage rate in the first quarter.
growth was led by the continued strength of frame relay services; ip services,
which include ip-connectivity services and virtual private network (vpn)
services; and high-speed private-line services.

at&amp;t; solutions outsourcing revenue grew at a mid-teens percentage rate in the
first quarter primarily due to growth from new contract signings and add-on
business from existing clients.

local voice services revenue grew at a low-teens percentage rate in the first
quarter. at&amp;t; added approximately 90,000 access lines in the first quarter
bringing total access lines in service as of march 31, 2001 to almost 2.4
million, an increase of 42.5% compared to march 31, 2000. at&amp;t; serves more than
6,000 buildings on-net representing a 3.2% increase compared to march 31, 2000.

business services internal revenue increased $0.1 billion, or 44.6%, in the
first quarter as a result of greater sales of business long distance services to
other at&amp;t; units that resell such services to their external customers,
primarily broadband, wireless services and excite@home.

ebit/ebitda

ebit and ebitda declined $0.1 billion, or 11.2% and 5.4%, respectively, in the
first quarter of 2001 compared with the same period last year. the decline
primarily reflects the impact of pricing pressure within the long distance voice
business as well as the shift from higher margin long distance services to lower
margin growth services. the decline also reflects the impact of equity losses
recorded for concert in the first quarter of $0.1 billion, representing a
decrease of approximately $0.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2000.
mostly offsetting the overall decrease was lower restructuring charges of $0.4
billion in the first quarter of 2001. for the remainder of 2001, concert is
expected to continue to generate operating losses. currently, concert is
considering restructuring its business in order to return to profitability.
these actions could result in significant restructuring charges. in addition,
at&amp;t; and bt are discussing ways to improve the performance of the concert
business. these discussions include a variety of strategic alternatives,
including the acquisition of, or other business combination of our business
services operations with bt's business services unit. we have also considered
narrowing the scope of concert's business, as well as its termination as a
joint venture.

revenue

consumer services revenue declined 20.5%, or 1.0 billion, in the first quarter
of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. the decline was primarily due
to a decline in traditional voice services, such as domestic dial 1, reflecting
the ongoing competitive nature of the consumer long distance industry, which has
resulted in pricing pressures. in addition, approximately $0.3 billion decline
was related to the elimination of per-lines charges in 2000. also negatively
impacting revenue was product substitution and market migration away from
direct-dial wireline and higher priced calling-card services to lower-priced
prepaid-card services.

the calling volume decline was in the low-teen percentage rate in the first
quarter of 2001 primarily due to both the competition in the long distance
industry and production substitution which we expect will continue to negatively
impact consumer services revenue.

ebit/ebitda

ebit and ebitda for consumer services declined 20.5% and 20.4%, respectively, in
the first quarter of 2001 compared with the first quarter of last year. the
declines were primarily driven by impacts of lower revenue partially offset by
cost-control initiatives.

capital additions was essentially flat in the first quarter of 2001 compared

total assets declined $0.4 billion in the first quarter to $2.8 billion at march

*ebitda for wireless services excludes net pretax (losses) earnings from equity
investments and other income.

revenue

wireless services revenue grew $1.0 billion, or 46.2%, to $3.2 billion in the
first quarter of 2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. approximately
$0.5 billion of the growth was due to acquisitions, primarily bay area
properties acquired in june 2000 and the los angeles market acquired in december
2000. the remaining increase was due to subscriber growth, slightly offset by a
decline in average monthly revenue per user (arpu).

consolidated subscribers grew 57.7% during the first quarter of 2001 to 15.7
million from 10.0 million for the first quarter of 2000. this growth included
approximately 3 million subscribers from acquisitions closed subsequent to the
first quarter of 2000. arpu was $62.20 for the first quarter of 2001, a 7.4%
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2000. at&amp;t; wireless group's average
monthly churn rate in the first quarter of 2001 was 3.0% compared with 2.9% in
the first quarter of 2000. the decline in arpu and the increase in average
monthly churn are primarily a result of competitive pricing pressures, expansion
into a broader base of consumer segments, including prepaid wireless services,
and the impact of acquisitions which closed subsequent to the first quarter
of 2000.

ebit/ebitda

ebit increased $7 million, or 6.5%, to $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2001
compared with the first quarter of 2000. the increase was primarily due to
higher revenue associated with the mobility business. however, these increases
were partially offset by higher sg&amp;a; and network costs to support growth in
subscribers and the wireless network, higher depreciation and amortization
expenses associated with an increased asset base and higher net pretax losses
from equity investments.

ebitda, which excludes net pretax (losses) earnings of equity investments and
other income, increased $0.3 billion, or 78.9%, in the first quarter of 2001 to
$0.7 billion compared with the prior year quarter. the improvement was primarily
driven by revenue growth associated with the mobility business. these
improvements were partially offset by related increase in expenses associated
with subscriber growth.

capital additions increased $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2001 to $1.9
billion compared with the first quarter of 2000. the increase was primarily
driven by capital expenditures to upgrade and increase network capacity and
improve network quality.

total assets were $47.0 billion as of march 31, 2001, an increase of $11.7
billion, or 33.4%, compared with december 31, 2000. $6.3 billion of the increase
was due to the net proceeds from the senior notes offering. also contributing to
the increase was $6.2 billion of proceeds from the ntt docomo investment that
was allocated to at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t.; these amounts received were
loaned back to at&amp;t;, in the form of an intercompany receivable. these increases
were partially offset by the repayment of short-term debt due to at&amp;t.;

broadband
our broadband segment offers a variety of services through our cable broadband
network, including traditional analog video and advanced services such as
digital video service, high-speed data service and broadband telephony service.

*ebitda for broadband excludes net losses from equity investments and
other income

results of operations for the three months ended march 2001, include the results
of mediaone since its acquisition on june 15, 2000, while the three months ended
march 2000, does not include any results of mediaone.

revenue

broadband revenue grew $0.9 billion, or 58.3% for the three months ended march
31, 2001 compared with the corresponding prior year period. approximately $0.8
billion of the increase in revenue was due to the acquisition of mediaone in
2000. in addition, revenue from advanced services (digital video, high-speed
data, and broadband telephony) contributed approximately $0.1 billion to
the increase.

at march 31, 2001, broadband serviced approximately 15.9 million basic cable
customers, passing approximately 28.1 million homes, compared with 11.1 million
basic cable customers, passing approximately 19.2 million homes at march 31,
2000. at march 2001, we provided digital video service to approximately 3.1
million customers, high-speed data service to approximately 1.3 million
customers and broadband telephony service to approximately 0.7 million
customers. this compares with nearly 2.0 million digital-video customers,
approximately 0.3 million high-speed data customers, and nearly 40,000 broadband
telephony customers at march 31, 2000.
<page>   54
ebit/ebitda

ebit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2001 was a deficit of $0.5 billion, a
decline of $0.7 billion from ebit of $0.2 billion for the comparable prior year
period. this decline was primarily due to $0.4 billion of gains on sales of
businesses and investments, recorded in the first quarter of 2000, primarily
gains on the swap of cable properties with cox as well as the prior year sale of
our investment in lenfest. also contributing to the decline was the impact of
the acquisition of mediaone, including higher amortization of goodwill and
purchased intangibles, and higher expenses associated with high-speed data and
broadband telephony services of approximately $0.5 billion. these decreases were
offset by $0.2 billion of lower pretax losses from equity investments.

ebitda, which excludes net losses from equity investments and other income, was
$0.4 billion for the three months ended march 31, 2001 an improvement of $0.1
billion, or 19.9% from the comparable prior year period. this improvement was
primarily due to the acquisition of mediaone offset by increased expenses
associated with high-speed data and broadband telephony services.

other items

capital additions decreased 32.3% to $0.9 billion at march 31, 2001, as compared
with $1.3 billion at march 31, 2000. this decrease was primarily driven by
decreased contributions to various nonconsolidated investments, slightly offset
by increased property, plant and equipment.

total assets at march 31, 2001, were $114.2 billion compared with $114.9 billion
at december 31, 2000. the decrease in total assets at march 31, 2001 is
primarily due to lower mark-to-market valuations on certain investments.

corporate and other
this group reflects the results of corporate staff functions, the elimination of
transactions between segments, as well as the results of excite@home.

revenue

revenue for corporate and other primarily includes the elimination of
intercompany revenue of negative $0.3 billion ($97 million increase from prior
year) and revenue from excite@home of approximately $0.1 billion which was
consolidated beginning september 1, 2000. the corporate and other revenue
decline was primarily due to the higher intercompany elimination as a result of
higher sales from business services to wireless and broadband.

ebit/ebitda

quarter of 2000. the decline was primarily due to the adoption of sfas 133 in
the quarter, which resulted in a charge of approximately $2.6 billion. also
contributing to the decline was asset impairment charges, net of minority
interest, of $0.3 billion recorded by excite@home and at&amp;t; related
to excite@home.

other items
capital additions increased approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of
2001 compared with the first quarter of 2000. the increase was driven by the
capital additions of excite@home of $0.1 billion.

total assets declined $11.4 billion during the first quarter of 2001 to $0.6
billion. the decline was primarily driven by elimination of intercompany
receivables with at&amp;t; wireless group of approximately $10.6 billion.

liberty media group results

liberty media group (lmg) produces, acquires and distributes entertainment,
educational and informational programming services through all available formats
and media. lmg is also engaged in electronic retailing services, direct
marketing services, advertising sales relating to programming services,
infomercials and transaction processing. losses from lmg were $0.2 billion for
the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with earnings of $0.9 billion
for the three months ended march 31, 2000. the decline was primarily due to
lower gains on dispositions, including gains associated with the mergers of
various companies that lmg had investments in. gains were recorded for the
difference between the carrying value of lmg's interest in the acquired company
and the fair value of securities received in the merger. in addition, the
impairment charges recorded on lmg's investments to reflect other than temporary
declines in value also contributed to the decline. these were partially offset
tax benefits recorded in the quarter associated with the net loss before
cumulative accounting change compared with tax expense in the prior year quarter
associated with net earnings as well as by the cumulative effect of the
accounting changes due to the adoption of sfas 133.

</c></c></s></caption></table>

in the first quarter of 2001, net cash provided by operating activities
decreased $0.6 billion, compared with the prior year period. the decrease
was primarily driven by decreases in accounts payable and net income
excluding the noncash income items. these decreases were partially offset
by lower receivables.

at&amp;t;'s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of $3.2 billion for
the first quarter of 2001, compared with use of cash of $5.0 billion for the
first quarter of 2000. during the first quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; paid approximately
$3.9 billion for capital expenditures and received approximately $0.6 billion
primarily related to the net dispositions of businesses. during the first
quarter of 2000, at&amp;t; spent approximately $3.2 billion on capital expenditures,
$1.1 billion primarily for investments in cable and wireless businesses and
loaned $1.0 billion to concert.
<page>   56
during the first quarter of 2001, net cash provided by financing activities was
$1.3 billion, compared with $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2000. during
the first quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; received $9.8 billion from the issuance of
convertible preferred stock to ntt docomo and $6.5 billion from the bond
offering completed by at&amp;t; wireless, proceeds which in part were used to repay
short-term debt of $14.7 billion. during the first quarter of 2000, at&amp;t;
received $3.2 billion from the issuance of short-term notes. this source of cash
was partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $1.0 billion and the
payment of dividends of $0.8 billion.

at march 31, 2001, we had current assets of $16.3 billion and current
liabilities of $34.4 billion. a significant portion of the current liabilities,
$17.2 billion, relates to short-term notes, the majority of which were
commercial paper or debt with an original maturity of one year or less. during
the first quarter of 2001, we continued to make progress in reducing our debt.
we have used proceeds received from the ntt docomo transaction and the wireless
bond offering to retire $14.7 billion of the short-term debt. we expect that we
will retire a portion of the remaining short-term debt with other financing
arrangements, including the monetization of publicly-held securities, sales of
certain non-strategic assets and investments, and securitization of certain
accounts receivable. during the quarter we have closed or announced the sale of
investments or assets, which will result in gross cash proceeds of approximately
$4.8 billion. subsequent to march 31, 2001, we also entered into a program to
securitize a small percentage of our consumer accounts receivable to receive up
to $0.5 billion, which will be used to retire a portion of the commercial paper.

at march 31, 2001, we had a current liability of $2.6 billion, reflecting our
obligation under put options held by comcast and cox. in january 2001, comcast
and cox exercised their rights under the put options and elected to receive at&amp;t;
stock in lieu of cash. in addition, on february 28, 2001, we exercised our
registration rights in twe and formally requested twe to begin the process of
converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registered equity
securities. on may 14, 2001, we named credit suisse first boston as our
investment banker for the registration process under the twe partnership
agreement. we also have requested cablevision systems corporation (cablevision)
to register for sale up to 30 million cablevision shares currently owned by
at&amp;t.;

in connection with the planned split-off of at&amp;t; wireless, we announced that we
will retain up to $3 billion in shares of at&amp;t; wireless services, which we will
dispose of within six months following the split-off. another aspect of our
restructuring is the expected sale, in late-2001, of a new class of stock which
will track our broadband business.

at&amp;t; is in a joint venture with alaska native wireless (anw), which participated
in the federal communication commission's recent auction of license spectrum. in
january 2001, the auction was completed, and anw was the highest bidder on
approximately $2.9 billion in licenses. at&amp;t; has committed to contribute $2.6
billion to fund this purchase. as of march 31, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group funded
approximately $309 of the commitment and has committed to provide the remaining
approximate $2.3 billion when such licenses are granted.

since the announced restructuring plans to create four new businesses, at&amp;t;'s
debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. as a
result of this review, at&amp;t;'s ratings have been either downgraded and/or put on
credit watch with negative outlook. these actions will result in an increased
cost of future borrowings and will limit our access to the capital markets.
<page>   57
at&amp;t; is pursing various measures to reduce its debt level. however, there can be
no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that are
acceptable to us. if these efforts cannot be completed successfully or on terms
and within the timeframe contemplated, at&amp;t;'s financial condition would be
materially adversely affected. some of these adverse conditions include the
company's ability to pursue acquisitions or make capital expenditures to expand
its network and cable plant, or pay dividends.

on december 28, 2000, we entered into a 364-day, $25 billion revolving-credit
facility syndicated to 39 banks. this facility was reduced to $17.5 billion
primarily as a result of the ntt docomo investment of $9.8 billion, the at&amp;t;
wireless bond offering and the sale of japan telecom. the 364-day facility
exists principally as a back-up source to our commercial paper program. on march
31, 2001, this facility was unused and at&amp;t; has no current plans to borrow
against this facility. in addition, on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless services
entered into $2.5 billion in revolving credit facilities. the facilities include
a 364-day tranche and a 5-year tranche. the facilities are for general corporate
purposes.

also in connection with our restructuring plan, we have reviewed our dividend
policy as it relates to each of the new businesses. on december 20, 2000, we
announced that the board of directors reduced at&amp;t;'s quarterly dividend to
$0.0375 per share, from $0.22 per share.

our board of directors has the power to make determinations that may impact the
financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stock groups. this
power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and debt
capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding
whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amount of any
capital expenditures. all actions by the board of directors are subject to the
board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a group and not
just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. as a result of this discretion
of our board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess each
group's liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of
each group based on past performance.

total assets decreased $1.0 billion, or 0.4%, to $241.1 billion at march 31,
2001 from $242.2 billion at december 31, 2000. the decrease was primarily due to
reduced goodwill, primarily driven by the excite@home impairment charge, lower
trade receivables and the lower market value of our short-term investments.
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in property, plant and
equipment resulting from capital expenditures net of depreciation.


total liabilities decreased $10.6 billion, or 8.2%, to $118.9 billion at march
31, 2001 from $129.4 billion at december 31, 2000. this decrease primarily
resulted from the payment of short-term debt and accounts payable with the
proceeds from the ntt docomo agreement. partially offsetting this decrease was
the issuance of $6.5 billion in long-term debt through at&amp;t; wireless services.


minority interest decreased $0.7 billion, or 13.5%, to $4.2 billion at march 31,
2001 from $4.9 billion at december 31, 2000. this decrease primarily reflects
the losses of excite@home, primarily driven by an asset impairment charge.
<page>   58
total shareowners' equity increased $0.8 billion, or 0.7%, to $104.0 billion at
march 31, 2001 from $103.2 billion at december 31, 2000. this increase primarily
resulted from the issuance of stock to acquire cable-systems from cablevision,
and an increase in additional paid-in capital related to the ntt docomo
warrants, as well as issuance of stock in connection with our employee
benefit plans.


net debt-to-annualized ebitda was 3.51x at march 31, 2001 as compared with 3.28x
at december 31, 2000, reflecting lower ebitda partially offset by lower debt.
the debt ratio (debt divided by total debt and equity) was 39.5% at march 31,
2001 as compared with 46.2% at december 31, 2000. for purposes of this
calculation, equity includes the convertible quarterly trust preferred
securities, redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary as well as convertible
preferred stock. the decrease in debt-to-capital was driven by the repayment of
short-term debt offset somewhat by the issuance of wireless bonds.


in addition, included in debt is approximately $8.6 billion of notes, which are
exchangeable into or collateralized by securities we own. excluding this debt,
the ratio of debt to total capital at march 31, 2001 was 35.6%.

risk management

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign exchange
rates. on a limited basis we use certain derivative financial instruments,
including interest rate swaps, options, forwards and other derivative contracts
to manage these risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. all financial instruments are used in accordance with
board-approved policies.

assuming a 10% downward shift in interest rates at march 31, 2001, the fair
value of unhedged debt would have increased by approximately $0.6 billion.
<page>   59
new accounting pronouncements

in september 2000, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued
statement of financial accounting standard (sfas) no. 140, "accounting for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities -
a replacement of fasb statement no. 125." this statement provides accounting and
reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishment of liabilities. under these standards, after a transfer of
financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
this statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. this
statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march 31, 2001. at&amp;t; does not
expect that the adoption of sfas no. 140 will have a material impact on at&amp;t;'s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

subsequent events

on may 7, 2001, at&amp;t; agreed to sell our 99.75% interest in an entity owning the
baltimore maryland cable-system serving approximately 110,000 customers to
comcast for approximately $0.5 billion. pending certain closing conditions and
regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in second or third
quarter of 2001.

on april 30, 2001, at&amp;t; received 63.9 million common shares of at&amp;t; common held
by comcast corporation in exchange for an entity owning cable-systems which
serves approximately 590 thousand customers in six states. the transaction
resulted in a pretax loss of $0.3 billion.

on april 27, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the sale announced on february 27, 2001, of
our 10% stake in japan telecom co. ltd to vodafone group plc for $1.35 billion
in cash. the proceeds from the transaction were split evenly between at&amp;t; and
at&amp;t; wireless group. the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately
$0.9 billion.

on april 26, 2001, at&amp;t; initiated a 364-day accounts receivable securitization
program providing for up to $0.5 billion of funding. under the program, a small
percentage of consumer accounts receivable will be sold on a discounted,
revolving basis, to a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary, which assigns
interests in such receivables to unrelated third-party financing entities. the
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
commercial paper.

           at&amp;t; wireless group management's discussion and analysis of
                  results of operations and financial condition

at&amp;t; wireless group overview

at&amp;t; wireless group is an integrated business of at&amp;t; and is not a stand-alone
entity. as at&amp;t; wireless group is a tracking stock of at&amp;t;, separate financial
statements are not required to be filed. we have provided the financial
statements as an exhibit to this document to provide additional disclosures to
investors to allow them to assess the financial performance of at&amp;t; wireless
group. since the tracking stocks are governed by a common board of directors,
the at&amp;t; board of directors could make operational and financial decisions or
implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses of any group.
for example, our board of directors may decide to transfer funds or to
reallocate assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups,
without the consent of shareholders. all actions by the board of directors are
subject to the board members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a
group and not just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our
charter, policy statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.

at&amp;t;'s board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth in the
tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion of our
board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group agreement but
without approval of our shareholders. in addition, the fact that we have
separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests
of the holders of at&amp;t; common stock, at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock and
liberty media group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
conflict. at&amp;t;'s board of directors would make any change or addition to the
policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, and
would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to at&amp;t; and all of our
shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interests
and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of
our shares.

you should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our board of
directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of a
tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.

at&amp;t; wireless group is a wireless telecommunications company which primarily
provides domestic wireless voice and data services and products in the 850
megahertz (cellular) and 1900 megahertz (personal communications services, or
pcs) markets. additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group offers wireless local telephone
and internet services to residential customers through its fixed wireless
business. at&amp;t; wireless group also holds equity interests in various domestic
and international wireless communications ventures and partnerships.

on april 27, 2000, at&amp;t; completed an offering of 15.6%, or 360 million shares,
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at an offering price of $29.50 per share.
at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock is a class of at&amp;t; common stock, which is
intended to provide holders with financial returns based on the financial
performance and economic value of at&amp;t;'s wireless services' businesses. at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock issued in the offering reflected only a portion of
the authorized shares. the remaining 84.4% was reserved for the benefit of at&amp;t;
common stock group (which consists of the operations of at&amp;t; other than those
attributed to at&amp;t; tracking stocks) and is intended to be reflected in at&amp;t;
common stock. see below for discussion of the investment by ntt docomo which
closed in january 2001. as a result of the docomo investment, assuming
conversion, at&amp;t; common stock group would retain an approximate 70% economic
interest in at&amp;t; wireless group.
<page>   62
the combined financial statements of at&amp;t; wireless group primarily include the
legal entity results of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. and its subsidiaries (aws)
and at&amp;t; wireless group, llc (awg), both of which were direct subsidiaries of
at&amp;t; corp., as of march 31, 2001. awg will be transferred to aws prior to
the split-off.

on october 25, 2000, as part of its restructuring plan, at&amp;t; announced its
decision to present an exchange offer to at&amp;t; common shareowners to allow them
to exchange any portion of shares of at&amp;t; common stock for shares of at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock, subject to pro-ration. at&amp;t; released details of
its exchange offer on april 18, 2001 and anticipates that the exchange offer
will be completed during the second quarter of 2001. under the terms of the
exchange offer, at&amp;t; will issue 1.176 shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock in exchange for each share of at&amp;t; common stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn, subject to specified conditions. at&amp;t; wireless group will continue to
be a part of at&amp;t; following the completion of the exchange offer. this exchange
offer will result in an increase in the percentage of outstanding shares held by
public shareholders and a decrease to the percentage reserved for the benefit of
at&amp;t; common stock group.

in connection with its restructuring plan, following the completion of the
exchange offer and subject to certain conditions, at&amp;t; intends to split-off at&amp;t;
wireless group from at&amp;t.; these conditions include the receipt of a favorable
ruling on the split-off from the internal revenue service (irs) and satisfaction
of conditions contained in an at&amp;t; credit agreement, including the repayment of
at&amp;t; wireless group's intercompany obligations to at&amp;t.;

on april 18, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., filed its initial registration
statement in connection with the planned split-off. the split-off, which is
anticipated to be completed in mid-2001, will include several steps. these steps
include transferring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of at&amp;t;
wireless group to at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., mandatorily exchanging all
issued and outstanding shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock, including
those shares issued in the exchange offer as well as the shares held by docomo,
for shares of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock, and distributing a
majority of the shares of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock held by at&amp;t;
common stock group, to holders of at&amp;t; common stock on a pro rata basis. at&amp;t;
intends to retain up to $3 billion of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock
for its own account for sale or exchange within six months of the split-off,
subject to receipt of a satisfactory irs ruling.

docomo investment

in january 2001, ntt docomo, a leading japanese wireless communications company,
invested $9.8 billion in a security of at&amp;t; that, like at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock, is intended to reflect a portion of the financial performance
and economic value of at&amp;t; wireless group. at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws and
awg, was allocated $6.2 billion of the gross proceeds from docomo's $9.8 billion
investment in at&amp;t.; additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group was allocated $18 of costs
associated with the transaction. at&amp;t; retained the remaining $3.6 billion of the
docomo investment proceeds as consideration for the reduction in at&amp;t;'s retained
portion of at&amp;t; wireless group's value. following the split-off, this investment
will be converted into approximately 16% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common
shares. docomo also received warrants at an exercise price of $35 per at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking share equivalent that would represent an approximate
additional 1.6% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common shares after the split-off. as
part of this investment, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, has entered into a
strategic alliance with docomo to develop mobile multimedia services on a
global-standard, high-speed wireless network. docomo may require the repurchase
of its investment at docomo's original purchase price, plus interest, if at&amp;t;
does not complete the split-off by specified dates beginning january 1, 2002, or
if at&amp;t; wireless group fails to meet specified technological milestones.

at&amp;t; wireless group combined results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2001
compared with the three months ended march 31, 2000

revenue

total revenue includes wireless voice and data services, the sale of handsets
and accessories, and revenue associated with the aviation communications and
fixed wireless operations. at&amp;t; wireless group records revenue as services are
provided or when the product is sold. services revenue primarily includes
monthly recurring charges, airtime and toll usage charges, and roaming charges
billed to subscribers for usage outside of at&amp;t; wireless group's network as well
as charges billed to other wireless providers for roaming on at&amp;t; wireless
group's network. the revenue and related expenses associated with the sales of
wireless handsets and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered
and accepted by the customer, as this is considered to be a separate earnings
process from the sale of wireless services.

total revenue increased 46.2% to $3,212 million for the three months ended march
31, 2001, compared with the same period in the prior year. total revenue
increased 25.7% for the three months ended march 30, 2001, compared with the
same period for 2000, when adjusted to exclude the impact of the bay area
properties and the los angeles market for the three months ended march 31, 2001.

the revenue increase for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was primarily
due to growth in our mobility business services revenue, driven by strong
consolidated subscriber growth, which was slightly offset by a decline in the
average monthly revenue per user (arpu).

services revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $2,931 million,
an increase of $939 million, or 47.2%, compared with the respective period
in 2000.

as of march 31, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group's mobility business had over 15.7
million consolidated subscribers, an increase of 57.7%, compared with the prior
year, including approximately 3 million subscribers associated with acquisitions
that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. net consolidated wireless
subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 totaled 585 thousand, a 40.0%
increase over the prior year quarter. at&amp;t; wireless group's average monthly
churn rate in the first quarter of 2001 was 3.0% compared with 2.9% in the first
quarter of 2000.

at&amp;t; wireless group's arpu for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$62.20, an decrease of $5.00, or 7.4%, compared with the same period in 2000.
<page>   64
the decline in arpu is primarily a result of competitive pricing pressures,
expansion into a broader base of consumer segments, including prepaid wireless,
and the impact of acquisitions which closed subsequent to the first quarter
of 2000.

equipment revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $281 million,
an increase of $75 million, or 36.6%, compared with the same period in 2000.
this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions in the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with the same
period in 2000. at&amp;t; wireless group supplies to its subscribers a selection of
handsets at competitive prices, which are generally offered at or below cost.

costs of services

costs of services include the costs to place calls over the network (including
the costs to operate and maintain at&amp;t; wireless group's network as well as
roaming costs paid to other wireless providers) and the charges paid to connect
calls on other networks, including those of at&amp;t.; additionally, costs of
services includes provision for uncollectible receivables, as well as non-income
related taxes.

costs of services for the three months ended march 31, 2001, were $921 million,
an increase of $259 million, or 39.3%, for the three months ended march 31,
2001, compared with the same period in 2000. approximately one-third of the
increase was due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables,
which resulted from a change in the mix of the subscriber base as a result of
broadening at&amp;t; wireless group's market segments. additionally, another one-half
of the increase was due to an increase in charges paid to connect calls on other
networks, including at&amp;t;'s, as well as an increase in the costs to maintain the
at&amp;t; wireless group's network. these increases were driven by growth in
subscriber base and the related increased minutes of use.

costs of equipment sales

costs of equipment sales include the costs of the handsets and accessories
provided to at&amp;t; wireless group customers. costs of equipment sales for the
three months ended march 31, 2001 were $490 million, an increase of $99 million,
or 25.2%, compared with the same period in 2000. this increase was due entirely
to higher equipment sales, as well as an increase in handset subsidies resulting
from the increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001
compared with the first quarter of 2000.

selling, general and administrative

selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march
31, 2001, were $1,084 million compared with $750 million for the three months
ended march 31, 2000. approximately forty percent of the increase was
attributable to higher marketing and selling costs, including advertising and
commissions, associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions for the three months ended march 31, 2001. cost per gross subscriber
addition, which includes the cost of handset subsidies recorded in costs of
equipment sales in the accompanying combined statement of operations, was $327
for the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with $360 for the three
months ended march 31, 2000. in addition, approximately one-third of the
increase was the result of growth in the wireless subscriber customer base and
the related increases in customer care and billing costs.

depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended march 31,
2001, were $576 million, an increase of $207 million, or 56.1%, compared with
the three months ended march 31, 2000. the increase primarily resulted from the
growth in the at&amp;t; wireless group's depreciable asset base resulting from
capital expenditures and property, plant and equipment acquired with
<page>   65
acquisitions that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. additionally,
effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group shortened the depreciable lives
of certain wireless communications equipment which resulted in approximately $36
million of additional depreciation expense for the three months ended march 31,
2001. total capital expenditures were $1,252 million for the three months ended
march 31, 2001. amortization expense increased from the prior year quarter as a
result of an increase in the amortization expense of licensing costs, goodwill,
and other acquisition related intangibles as a result of acquisitions that
closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. as a result of at&amp;t; wireless
group's evaluation of recent changes in the wireless telecommunications industry
and the views of regulatory authorities, effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t;
wireless group will use an amortization period for all licensing costs and
goodwill associated with newly acquired wireless operations not to exceed 25
years. this change did not have a material impact to at&amp;t; wireless group's
results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2001.

other income

other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges of assets
and intercompany interest income on the note receivable from at&amp;t.; other income
for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $84 million compared with $24
million for the respective period in 2000. the increase was due primarily to $77
million of intercompany interest income on the note receivable from at&amp;t; for the
first quarter of 2001.

interest expense

interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt to
others and intercompany debt due to at&amp;t;, less interest expense capitalized.
interest expense for the first quarter of 2001, was $47 million, a decrease of
$4 million, or 6.8%, compared with the first quarter of 2000. the decrease was
primarily due to lower levels of average outstanding debt due to at&amp;t.;
additionally, capitalized interest increased as a result of increased capital
expenditures. these decreases were offset by interest expense associated with
the $6.5 billion of senior notes issued by aws in march 2001.

provision (benefit) for income taxes

the provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was a provision of $79 million compared with $2 million of benefit for the
same period in 2000. the increase was due primarily to the increase in income
before net equity earnings (losses) in the current year quarter compared with
the prior year quarter. the effective income tax rate for the three months ended
march 31, 2001, was 44.4% and was primarily impacted by goodwill associated with
acquisitions that closed during 2000. excluding a one-time gain recorded in the
first quarter of 2000, the effective income tax rate for the prior year quarter
was 48.9% and was also impacted primarily by goodwill associated with the
2000 acquisitions.

net equity (losses) earnings from investments

net equity (losses) earnings from investments, net of tax, were $99 million of
losses for the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with $25 million of
earnings for the respective period in 2000. the decrease was primarily due to
equity earnings from cmt partners and ab cellular during the first quarter of
2000. at&amp;t; wireless group acquired the remaining interest in cmt partners that
they did not own in june 2000, and therefore, this entity was consolidated
subsequent to the acquisition. additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group's equity
interest in ab cellular was redeemed in december 2000. in addition, equity
losses increased associated with at&amp;t; wireless group's affiliate and
international investments in the first quarter of 2001 compared with the first
quarter of 2000.
<page>   66
dividend requirements on preferred stock held by at&amp;t;

at march 31, 2001, and december 31, 2000, at&amp;t; wireless group had outstanding,
$3.0 billion of preferred stock held by at&amp;t; that pays dividends at 9% per
annum. dividend requirements on this preferred stock for the three months ended
march 31, 2001 were $42 million compared with $13 million for the respective
period in 2000, net of amounts recorded in accordance with the tax sharing
agreement. the increase was a result of the may 1, 2000, recapitalization of
$2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t; into an additional
$2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by at&amp;t.;

at&amp;t; wireless group liquidity and capital resources

currently, financing activities for at&amp;t; wireless group are managed by at&amp;t; on a
centralized basis and are subject to the review of at&amp;t; wireless group's capital
stock committee. the at&amp;t; wireless group capital stock committee is selected by
at&amp;t;'s board of directors to oversee the interaction between businesses of at&amp;t;
common stock group and at&amp;t; wireless group in accordance with the at&amp;t; wireless
group policy statement. under the at&amp;t; wireless group policy statement, all
material transactions between at&amp;t; common stock group and at&amp;t; wireless group
are determined and governed by a process of fair dealing. sources for at&amp;t;
wireless group's future financing requirements may include the borrowing of
funds, including additional short-term floating rate debt from at&amp;t; prior to the
split-off, and/or third-party debt. loans from at&amp;t; to any member of at&amp;t;
wireless group have been made at interest rates and on other terms and
conditions intended to be substantially equivalent to the interest rates and
other terms and conditions that at&amp;t; wireless group would be able to obtain from
third parties, including the public markets, as a non-affiliate of at&amp;t; without
the benefit of any guaranty by at&amp;t.; this policy contemplates that these loans
will be made on the basis set forth above regardless of the interest rates and
other terms and conditions on which at&amp;t; may have acquired the funds. if,
however, at&amp;t; incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available funds for
use by at&amp;t; wireless group, those fees or charges will be allocated to at&amp;t;
wireless group.

at&amp;t;'s board of directors has the power to make determinations that may impact
the financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stock groups. this
power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and debt
capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding
whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amount of any
capital expenditures. all actions by the board of directors are subject to the
board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a group and not
just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. as a result of this discretion
of at&amp;t;'s board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess each
group's liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of
each group based on past performance.

the continued expansion of at&amp;t; wireless group's network and footprint,
including spectrum auctions and the marketing and distribution of its products
and services, will continue to require substantial capital. prior to 2001, at&amp;t;
wireless group funded its operations with proceeds from the april 2000 offering
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock attributed from at&amp;t;, intercompany
borrowings from at&amp;t;, internally generated funds, as well as capital
contributions from at&amp;t; prior to the april 2000 offering. capital contributions
from at&amp;t; prior to the april 2000 offering included acquisitions made by at&amp;t;
that have been attributed to at&amp;t; wireless group. noncash capital contributions
from at&amp;t; to at&amp;t; wireless group related to acquisitions and initial investments
funded by at&amp;t; totaled $552 million for the three months ended march 31, 2000.

the april 2000 offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock resulted in net
proceeds to at&amp;t; after deducting underwriter's discount and related fees and
expenses of $10.3 billion. at&amp;t; attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds to
<page>   67
at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany note receivable, which was
repaid by december 31, 2000, and was used primarily to fund acquisitions and
capital expenditures.

on may 1, 2000, in conjunction with the offering, at&amp;t; wireless group
recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t; into
an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by at&amp;t.; in
conjunction with the recapitalization, at&amp;t; wireless group's long-term debt due
to at&amp;t; was recapitalized to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a fixed
rate of 8.1% per annum.

on january 22, 2001, at&amp;t; closed their transaction with ntt docomo. at&amp;t;
attributed $6.1 billion of the approximate $9.8 billion of net proceeds received
from the docomo investment to at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany
note receivable. at&amp;t; wireless group intends to utilize the proceeds to continue
executing their strategy to expand their capacity, enlarge their footprint,
create an advanced mobile internet and invest in other strategic growth
initiatives, as well as to satisfy intercompany obligations. it is intended that
any outstanding balance on the intercompany note receivable will be repaid by
at&amp;t; prior to the split-off.

on march 6, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, completed a private
placement of $6.5 billion in unsecured and unsubordinated senior notes with
maturity dates from march 1, 2006 to march 1, 2031. the notes pay interest at
fixed rates ranging from 7.350% to 8.750% per annum, payable semi-annually and
include customary covenants. the notes include registration rights, such that
aws is required to exchange the notes for a new issue of notes registered under
the securities act of 1933 and are to be declared effective no later than 240
days after the issue date. at&amp;t; wireless group had $38 of interest expense for
the quarter ended march 31, 2001 related to those notes.

on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, entered into competitive
advance and revolving credit facilities (the "facilities") in the aggregate
amount of $2.5 billion consisting of an up to $1.25 billion 364-day competitive
advance and revolving credit facility and an up to $1.25 billion five-year
competitive advance and revolving credit facility. the facilities are subject to
a facility fee ranging from 8 to 30 basis points, payable quarterly on the total
commitment, used or unused. the facility fees are based on the respective
agreement and will fluctuate based on at&amp;t; wireless group's senior notes rating.
the facilities are also subject to a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points if
borrowings exceed certain levels as defined in the agreement. the facilities
bear interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases, (i) libor plus
32.5 to 100 basis points depending on at&amp;t; wireless group's senior notes rating,
or (ii) the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus
50 basis points. the facilities are to be used for general corporate purposes
and are subject to customary covenants, representations and warranties and
events of default. in addition, the facilities contain financial covenants
requiring at&amp;t; wireless group to maintain certain financial ratios and prohibit
aws from declaring and/or paying dividends prior to the split-off. the
facilities also specifies limitations on at&amp;t;'s and at&amp;t; wireless group's
ability to consummate the split-off including a provision that it will
constitute an event of default if the split-off is consummated without obtaining
a favorable tax ruling from the irs or an unqualified tax opinion that the
split-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction. in addition, the existence of
an obligation by at&amp;t; wireless group to repurchase equity interests from docomo
may under certain circumstances constitute an event of default. no amounts had
been borrowed under the facilities at march 31, 2001.
<page>   68
in association with the intended split-off of at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t;
announced on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; and at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. anticipate
that they will enter into a separation and distribution agreement that will
govern the terms of the split-off. as part of this agreement, at&amp;t; wireless
services will agree, upon completion of the split-off, to repay the full amount
of the principal and accrued but unpaid interest or face value and accrued but
unpaid dividends, of all outstanding indebtedness owned by at&amp;t; wireless group
to at&amp;t;, and all preferred stock in at&amp;t; wireless group held by at&amp;t.;

at&amp;t; performs cash management functions on behalf of at&amp;t; wireless group.
substantially all of at&amp;t; wireless group's cash balances are swept to at&amp;t; on a
daily basis, where they are managed and invested by at&amp;t.; prior to the offering
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock, transfers of cash to and from at&amp;t; were
reflected as a component of combined attributed net assets, with no interest
income or expense reflected. subsequent to the offering, transfers are reflected
as changes in the note receivable from or short-term debt payable to at&amp;t.; cash
balances maintained and reported by at&amp;t; wireless group primarily represent cash
balances for which no right of offset exists with at&amp;t.;

net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was $655 million, compared with $228 million for the same period in 2000.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a
$322 million increase in operating income excluding depreciation and
amortization, resulting from revenue growth and expense leveraging as well as an
increase in deferred income taxes. these increases were partially offset by a
larger decrease in payroll and benefit related liabilities for the three months
ended march 31, 2001, compared with the prior year. net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $12,519 million,
compared with $948 million for the three months ended march 31, 2000. the
increase was due primarily to the issuance of a note receivable from at&amp;t;
totaling $10,588 million, increased contributions into equity investments, and
higher capital expenditures to upgrade and increase network capacity. net cash
provided by financing activities for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$11,836 million, compared with $725 million for the three months ended march 31,
2000. the increase was primarily due to the $6.1 billion of net proceeds from
the docomo investment that at&amp;t; attributed to at&amp;t; wireless group, as well as
the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes,
partially offset by the repayment of the $638 million of short-term debt due
to at&amp;t.;

ebitda, defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, is the
primary measure used by the chief operating decision-makers to measure our
ability to generate cash flow. ebitda may or may not be consistent with the
calculation of ebitda for other public companies and should not be viewed by
investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles,
measures of performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities as a measure of liquidity.

ebitda for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $717 million compared with
$395 million for the same period in 2000. the increase was primarily the result
of growth in services revenue, partially offset by increased customer
acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions, increased network costs attributable to subscriber growth and the
related minutes of use, increased provision for uncollectible receivables, and
increased customer care and billing related expenses to support growth in the
subscriber base.

for the mobility business, ebitda for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$788 million compared with $431 million for the same period in 2000.
<page>   69
for the fixed wireless business, ebitda for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was a deficit of $68 million compared with a deficit of $34 million for
the same period in 2000.

ebitda margin, defined as ebitda as a percentage of total revenue, was 22.3% for
the first quarter of 2001, compared with 18.0% for the first quarter of 2000.
the improvement in ebitda margin was primarily due to revenue growth and expense
leveraging, primarily off-network roaming expenses, partially offset by
increased provision for uncollectible receivables.

ebitda margin for the mobility business was 24.5% for the first quarter of 2001
compared with 19.6% for the first quarter of 2000.

at&amp;t; wireless group financial condition

total assets were $47,039 million as of march 31, 2001, an increase of $11,737
million, or 33.2%, compared with december 31, 2000. the increase was due
primarily to an increase in the intercompany note receivable from at&amp;t; of
$10,588 million which resulted from at&amp;t; attributing $6.1 billion of the docomo
investment net proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group, and at&amp;t; wireless group loaning
the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the senior notes to at&amp;t.; partially
offsetting these proceeds were the repayment of the $638 million of short-term
debt due to at&amp;t;, as well as capital expenditures and contributions made to
non-consolidated investments during the first quarter of 2001.

total liabilities were $16,060 million as of march 31, 2001, an increase of
$5,676 million, or 54.7%, compared with december 31, 2000. the increase was
primarily due to the issuance of the $6.5 billion of senior notes, as well as
increased operating accruals, partially offset by the repayment of $638 million
of short-term debt due to at&amp;t;, and decreases in payroll and benefit related
liabilities and accounts payable.

total combined attributed net assets was $30,937 million as of march 31, 2001,
an increase of $6,606 million, or 24.4%, compared with december 31, 2000. the
increase was primarily due to at&amp;t;'s attribution of the $6.1 billion of docomo
investment net proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group.

recent accounting pronouncements

in september 2000, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas
no. 140, "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities - a replacement of fasb no. 125". this statement
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. under these standards,
after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and
servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes
financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities
when extinguished. this statement provides consistent standards for
distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that
are secured borrowings. this statement is effective for transfers and servicing
of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march 31,
2001. at&amp;t; wireless group does not expect that the adoption of sfas no. 140 will
have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

at&amp;t; wireless group subsequent events

on april 27, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the sale of its entire interest in japan
telecom for approximately $1.35 billion in cash. at&amp;t; attributed $.5 billion of
the net after-tax proceeds from the sale to at&amp;t; wireless group. at&amp;t; wireless
group recognized an after-tax gain of $298 million associated with the
transaction, which was recorded in net equity earnings from investments in the
second quarter of 2001.

during the first quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, made
unsecured term loans to rogers wireless to pay for spectrum it successfully bid
upon in the recently completed canadian spectrum auctions. in april 2001, rogers
wireless effected a rights offering of its equity securities in which at&amp;t;
wireless group's joint venture with british telecommunications, jvii,
participated. the participation increased jvii's ownership interest in rogers
wireless to 34.36%. at&amp;t; wireless group funded the purchase on behalf of jvii by
offsetting it against the unsecured, interest bearing note made by aws. this
transaction resulted in at&amp;t; wireless group obtaining a controlling interest of
jvii, as well as increasing the indirect ownership percentage in rogers
wireless. as a result of the consolidation of jvii, which holds the equity
interest in rogers wireless, at&amp;t; wireless group's investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, as well as minority interest liability, increased approximately
$420 million in april 2001.

                           part ii - other information

item 2c.  changes in securities and use of proceeds

on january 22, 2001, in a private placement transaction exempt from registration
pursuant to section 4(2) of the securities act of 1933, as amended, as a
transaction not involving a public offering, the company sold to ntt docomo for
an aggregate price of $9.8 billion newly issued at&amp;t; convertible preferred stock

the convertible preferred stock is convertible into 406 million shares of at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock at the option of ntt docomo. the warrants will be
exercisable in five years to purchase 41.7 million at&amp;t; wireless group tracking

first boston corporation, in association with the deal. the fees were discounted
from the proceeds from the convertible preferred stock and will be accreted
monthly for thirteen months. the company allocated $6.1 billion of the net
proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group which will be used to continue executing its
strategy to expand its capacity, enlarge its footprint, create an advanced
mobile internet, and invest in other strategic growth initiatives, as well as to

           at&amp;t; wireless group management's discussion and analysis of
                  results of operations and financial condition

at&amp;t; wireless group overview

at&amp;t; wireless group is an integrated business of at&amp;t; and is not a stand-alone
entity. as at&amp;t; wireless group is a tracking stock of at&amp;t;, separate financial
statements are not required to be filed. we have provided the financial
statements as an exhibit to this document to provide additional disclosures to
investors to allow them to assess the financial performance of at&amp;t; wireless
group. since the tracking stocks are governed by a common board of directors,
the at&amp;t; board of directors could make operational and financial decisions or
implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses of any group.
for example, our board of directors may decide to transfer funds or to
reallocate assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups,
without the consent of shareholders. all actions by the board of directors are
subject to the board members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a
group and not just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our
charter, policy statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.

at&amp;t;'s board of directors may change or supplement the policies set forth in the
tracking stock policy statements and our by-laws in the sole discretion of our
board of directors, subject to the provisions of any inter-group agreement but
without approval of our shareholders. in addition, the fact that we have
separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests
of the holders of at&amp;t; common stock, at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock and
liberty media group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
conflict. at&amp;t;'s board of directors would make any change or addition to the
policies set forth in the tracking stock policy statements or our by-laws, and
would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to at&amp;t; and all of our
shareholders after giving consideration to the potentially divergent interests
and all other relevant interests of the holders of the separate classes of
our shares.

you should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our board of
directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of a
tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.

at&amp;t; wireless group is a wireless telecommunications company which primarily
provides domestic wireless voice and data services and products in the 850
megahertz (cellular) and 1900 megahertz (personal communications services, or
pcs) markets. additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group offers wireless local telephone
and internet services to residential customers through its fixed wireless
business. at&amp;t; wireless group also holds equity interests in various domestic
and international wireless communications ventures and partnerships.

on april 27, 2000, at&amp;t; completed an offering of 15.6%, or 360 million shares,
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at an offering price of $29.50 per share.
at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock is a class of at&amp;t; common stock, which is
intended to provide holders with financial returns based on the financial
performance and economic value of at&amp;t;'s wireless services' businesses. at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock issued in the offering reflected only a portion of
the authorized shares. the remaining 84.4% was reserved for the benefit of at&amp;t;
common stock group (which consists of the operations of at&amp;t; other than those
attributed to at&amp;t; tracking stocks) and is intended to be reflected in at&amp;t;
common stock. see below for discussion of the investment by ntt docomo which
closed in january 2001. as a result of the docomo investment, assuming
conversion, at&amp;t; common stock group would retain an approximate 70% economic
interest in at&amp;t; wireless group.
<page>   62
the combined financial statements of at&amp;t; wireless group primarily include the
legal entity results of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. and its subsidiaries (aws)
and at&amp;t; wireless group, llc (awg), both of which were direct subsidiaries of
at&amp;t; corp., as of march 31, 2001. awg will be transferred to aws prior to
the split-off.

on october 25, 2000, as part of its restructuring plan, at&amp;t; announced its
decision to present an exchange offer to at&amp;t; common shareowners to allow them
to exchange any portion of shares of at&amp;t; common stock for shares of at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock, subject to pro-ration. at&amp;t; released details of
its exchange offer on april 18, 2001 and anticipates that the exchange offer
will be completed during the second quarter of 2001. under the terms of the
exchange offer, at&amp;t; will issue 1.176 shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock in exchange for each share of at&amp;t; common stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn, subject to specified conditions. at&amp;t; wireless group will continue to
be a part of at&amp;t; following the completion of the exchange offer. this exchange
offer will result in an increase in the percentage of outstanding shares held by
public shareholders and a decrease to the percentage reserved for the benefit of
at&amp;t; common stock group.

in connection with its restructuring plan, following the completion of the
exchange offer and subject to certain conditions, at&amp;t; intends to split-off at&amp;t;
wireless group from at&amp;t.; these conditions include the receipt of a favorable
ruling on the split-off from the internal revenue service (irs) and satisfaction
of conditions contained in an at&amp;t; credit agreement, including the repayment of
at&amp;t; wireless group's intercompany obligations to at&amp;t.;

on april 18, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., filed its initial registration
statement in connection with the planned split-off. the split-off, which is
anticipated to be completed in mid-2001, will include several steps. these steps
include transferring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of at&amp;t;
wireless group to at&amp;t; wireless services, inc., mandatorily exchanging all
issued and outstanding shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock, including
those shares issued in the exchange offer as well as the shares held by docomo,
for shares of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock, and distributing a
majority of the shares of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock held by at&amp;t;
common stock group, to holders of at&amp;t; common stock on a pro rata basis. at&amp;t;
intends to retain up to $3 billion of at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. common stock
for its own account for sale or exchange within six months of the split-off,
subject to receipt of a satisfactory irs ruling.

docomo investment

in january 2001, ntt docomo, a leading japanese wireless communications company,
invested $9.8 billion in a security of at&amp;t; that, like at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock, is intended to reflect a portion of the financial performance
and economic value of at&amp;t; wireless group. at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws and
awg, was allocated $6.2 billion of the gross proceeds from docomo's $9.8 billion
investment in at&amp;t.; additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group was allocated $18 of costs
associated with the transaction. at&amp;t; retained the remaining $3.6 billion of the
docomo investment proceeds as consideration for the reduction in at&amp;t;'s retained
portion of at&amp;t; wireless group's value. following the split-off, this investment
will be converted into approximately 16% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common
shares. docomo also received warrants at an exercise price of $35 per at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking share equivalent that would represent an approximate
additional 1.6% of at&amp;t; wireless services' common shares after the split-off. as
part of this investment, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, has entered into a
strategic alliance with docomo to develop mobile multimedia services on a
global-standard, high-speed wireless network. docomo may require the repurchase
of its investment at docomo's original purchase price, plus interest, if at&amp;t;
does not complete the split-off by specified dates beginning january 1, 2002, or
if at&amp;t; wireless group fails to meet specified technological milestones.

at&amp;t; wireless group combined results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2001
compared with the three months ended march 31, 2000

revenue

total revenue includes wireless voice and data services, the sale of handsets
and accessories, and revenue associated with the aviation communications and
fixed wireless operations. at&amp;t; wireless group records revenue as services are
provided or when the product is sold. services revenue primarily includes
monthly recurring charges, airtime and toll usage charges, and roaming charges
billed to subscribers for usage outside of at&amp;t; wireless group's network as well
as charges billed to other wireless providers for roaming on at&amp;t; wireless
group's network. the revenue and related expenses associated with the sales of
wireless handsets and accessories are recognized when the products are delivered
and accepted by the customer, as this is considered to be a separate earnings
process from the sale of wireless services.

total revenue increased 46.2% to $3,212 million for the three months ended march
31, 2001, compared with the same period in the prior year. total revenue
increased 25.7% for the three months ended march 30, 2001, compared with the
same period for 2000, when adjusted to exclude the impact of the bay area
properties and the los angeles market for the three months ended march 31, 2001.

the revenue increase for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was primarily
due to growth in our mobility business services revenue, driven by strong
consolidated subscriber growth, which was slightly offset by a decline in the
average monthly revenue per user (arpu).

services revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $2,931 million,
an increase of $939 million, or 47.2%, compared with the respective period
in 2000.

as of march 31, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group's mobility business had over 15.7
million consolidated subscribers, an increase of 57.7%, compared with the prior
year, including approximately 3 million subscribers associated with acquisitions
that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. net consolidated wireless
subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001 totaled 585 thousand, a 40.0%
increase over the prior year quarter. at&amp;t; wireless group's average monthly
churn rate in the first quarter of 2001 was 3.0% compared with 2.9% in the first
quarter of 2000.

at&amp;t; wireless group's arpu for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$62.20, an decrease of $5.00, or 7.4%, compared with the same period in 2000.
<page>   64
the decline in arpu is primarily a result of competitive pricing pressures,
expansion into a broader base of consumer segments, including prepaid wireless,
and the impact of acquisitions which closed subsequent to the first quarter
of 2000.

equipment revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $281 million,
an increase of $75 million, or 36.6%, compared with the same period in 2000.
this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions in the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with the same
period in 2000. at&amp;t; wireless group supplies to its subscribers a selection of
handsets at competitive prices, which are generally offered at or below cost.

costs of services

costs of services include the costs to place calls over the network (including
the costs to operate and maintain at&amp;t; wireless group's network as well as
roaming costs paid to other wireless providers) and the charges paid to connect
calls on other networks, including those of at&amp;t.; additionally, costs of
services includes provision for uncollectible receivables, as well as non-income
related taxes.

costs of services for the three months ended march 31, 2001, were $921 million,
an increase of $259 million, or 39.3%, for the three months ended march 31,
2001, compared with the same period in 2000. approximately one-third of the
increase was due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables,
which resulted from a change in the mix of the subscriber base as a result of
broadening at&amp;t; wireless group's market segments. additionally, another one-half
of the increase was due to an increase in charges paid to connect calls on other
networks, including at&amp;t;'s, as well as an increase in the costs to maintain the
at&amp;t; wireless group's network. these increases were driven by growth in
subscriber base and the related increased minutes of use.

costs of equipment sales

costs of equipment sales include the costs of the handsets and accessories
provided to at&amp;t; wireless group customers. costs of equipment sales for the
three months ended march 31, 2001 were $490 million, an increase of $99 million,
or 25.2%, compared with the same period in 2000. this increase was due entirely
to higher equipment sales, as well as an increase in handset subsidies resulting
from the increase in gross subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2001
compared with the first quarter of 2000.

selling, general and administrative

selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march
31, 2001, were $1,084 million compared with $750 million for the three months
ended march 31, 2000. approximately forty percent of the increase was
attributable to higher marketing and selling costs, including advertising and
commissions, associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions for the three months ended march 31, 2001. cost per gross subscriber
addition, which includes the cost of handset subsidies recorded in costs of
equipment sales in the accompanying combined statement of operations, was $327
for the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with $360 for the three
months ended march 31, 2000. in addition, approximately one-third of the
increase was the result of growth in the wireless subscriber customer base and
the related increases in customer care and billing costs.

depreciation and amortization

depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended march 31,
2001, were $576 million, an increase of $207 million, or 56.1%, compared with
the three months ended march 31, 2000. the increase primarily resulted from the
growth in the at&amp;t; wireless group's depreciable asset base resulting from
capital expenditures and property, plant and equipment acquired with
<page>   65
acquisitions that closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. additionally,
effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group shortened the depreciable lives
of certain wireless communications equipment which resulted in approximately $36
million of additional depreciation expense for the three months ended march 31,
2001. total capital expenditures were $1,252 million for the three months ended
march 31, 2001. amortization expense increased from the prior year quarter as a
result of an increase in the amortization expense of licensing costs, goodwill,
and other acquisition related intangibles as a result of acquisitions that
closed subsequent to the first quarter of 2000. as a result of at&amp;t; wireless
group's evaluation of recent changes in the wireless telecommunications industry
and the views of regulatory authorities, effective january 1, 2001, at&amp;t;
wireless group will use an amortization period for all licensing costs and
goodwill associated with newly acquired wireless operations not to exceed 25
years. this change did not have a material impact to at&amp;t; wireless group's
results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2001.

other income

other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges of assets
and intercompany interest income on the note receivable from at&amp;t.; other income
for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $84 million compared with $24
million for the respective period in 2000. the increase was due primarily to $77
million of intercompany interest income on the note receivable from at&amp;t; for the
first quarter of 2001.

interest expense

interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt to
others and intercompany debt due to at&amp;t;, less interest expense capitalized.
interest expense for the first quarter of 2001, was $47 million, a decrease of
$4 million, or 6.8%, compared with the first quarter of 2000. the decrease was
primarily due to lower levels of average outstanding debt due to at&amp;t.;
additionally, capitalized interest increased as a result of increased capital
expenditures. these decreases were offset by interest expense associated with
the $6.5 billion of senior notes issued by aws in march 2001.

provision (benefit) for income taxes

the provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was a provision of $79 million compared with $2 million of benefit for the
same period in 2000. the increase was due primarily to the increase in income
before net equity earnings (losses) in the current year quarter compared with
the prior year quarter. the effective income tax rate for the three months ended
march 31, 2001, was 44.4% and was primarily impacted by goodwill associated with
acquisitions that closed during 2000. excluding a one-time gain recorded in the
first quarter of 2000, the effective income tax rate for the prior year quarter
was 48.9% and was also impacted primarily by goodwill associated with the
2000 acquisitions.

net equity (losses) earnings from investments

net equity (losses) earnings from investments, net of tax, were $99 million of
losses for the three months ended march 31, 2001, compared with $25 million of
earnings for the respective period in 2000. the decrease was primarily due to
equity earnings from cmt partners and ab cellular during the first quarter of
2000. at&amp;t; wireless group acquired the remaining interest in cmt partners that
they did not own in june 2000, and therefore, this entity was consolidated
subsequent to the acquisition. additionally, at&amp;t; wireless group's equity
interest in ab cellular was redeemed in december 2000. in addition, equity
losses increased associated with at&amp;t; wireless group's affiliate and
international investments in the first quarter of 2001 compared with the first
quarter of 2000.
<page>   66
dividend requirements on preferred stock held by at&amp;t;

at march 31, 2001, and december 31, 2000, at&amp;t; wireless group had outstanding,
$3.0 billion of preferred stock held by at&amp;t; that pays dividends at 9% per
annum. dividend requirements on this preferred stock for the three months ended
march 31, 2001 were $42 million compared with $13 million for the respective
period in 2000, net of amounts recorded in accordance with the tax sharing
agreement. the increase was a result of the may 1, 2000, recapitalization of
$2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t; into an additional
$2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by at&amp;t.;

at&amp;t; wireless group liquidity and capital resources

currently, financing activities for at&amp;t; wireless group are managed by at&amp;t; on a
centralized basis and are subject to the review of at&amp;t; wireless group's capital
stock committee. the at&amp;t; wireless group capital stock committee is selected by
at&amp;t;'s board of directors to oversee the interaction between businesses of at&amp;t;
common stock group and at&amp;t; wireless group in accordance with the at&amp;t; wireless
group policy statement. under the at&amp;t; wireless group policy statement, all
material transactions between at&amp;t; common stock group and at&amp;t; wireless group
are determined and governed by a process of fair dealing. sources for at&amp;t;
wireless group's future financing requirements may include the borrowing of
funds, including additional short-term floating rate debt from at&amp;t; prior to the
split-off, and/or third-party debt. loans from at&amp;t; to any member of at&amp;t;
wireless group have been made at interest rates and on other terms and
conditions intended to be substantially equivalent to the interest rates and
other terms and conditions that at&amp;t; wireless group would be able to obtain from
third parties, including the public markets, as a non-affiliate of at&amp;t; without
the benefit of any guaranty by at&amp;t.; this policy contemplates that these loans
will be made on the basis set forth above regardless of the interest rates and
other terms and conditions on which at&amp;t; may have acquired the funds. if,
however, at&amp;t; incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available funds for
use by at&amp;t; wireless group, those fees or charges will be allocated to at&amp;t;
wireless group.

at&amp;t;'s board of directors has the power to make determinations that may impact
the financial and liquidity position of each of the tracking stock groups. this
power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and debt
capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding
whether to make capital expenditures and as to the timing and amount of any
capital expenditures. all actions by the board of directors are subject to the
board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of at&amp;t; as a group and not
just to holders of a particular class of tracking stock and to our policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. as a result of this discretion
of at&amp;t;'s board of directors, it may be difficult for investors to assess each
group's liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of
each group based on past performance.

the continued expansion of at&amp;t; wireless group's network and footprint,
including spectrum auctions and the marketing and distribution of its products
and services, will continue to require substantial capital. prior to 2001, at&amp;t;
wireless group funded its operations with proceeds from the april 2000 offering
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock attributed from at&amp;t;, intercompany
borrowings from at&amp;t;, internally generated funds, as well as capital
contributions from at&amp;t; prior to the april 2000 offering. capital contributions
from at&amp;t; prior to the april 2000 offering included acquisitions made by at&amp;t;
that have been attributed to at&amp;t; wireless group. noncash capital contributions
from at&amp;t; to at&amp;t; wireless group related to acquisitions and initial investments
funded by at&amp;t; totaled $552 million for the three months ended march 31, 2000.

the april 2000 offering of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock resulted in net
proceeds to at&amp;t; after deducting underwriter's discount and related fees and
expenses of $10.3 billion. at&amp;t; attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds to
<page>   67
at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany note receivable, which was
repaid by december 31, 2000, and was used primarily to fund acquisitions and
capital expenditures.

on may 1, 2000, in conjunction with the offering, at&amp;t; wireless group
recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to at&amp;t; into
an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held by at&amp;t.; in
conjunction with the recapitalization, at&amp;t; wireless group's long-term debt due
to at&amp;t; was recapitalized to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a fixed
rate of 8.1% per annum.

on january 22, 2001, at&amp;t; closed their transaction with ntt docomo. at&amp;t;
attributed $6.1 billion of the approximate $9.8 billion of net proceeds received
from the docomo investment to at&amp;t; wireless group in the form of an intercompany
note receivable. at&amp;t; wireless group intends to utilize the proceeds to continue
executing their strategy to expand their capacity, enlarge their footprint,
create an advanced mobile internet and invest in other strategic growth
initiatives, as well as to satisfy intercompany obligations. it is intended that
any outstanding balance on the intercompany note receivable will be repaid by
at&amp;t; prior to the split-off.

on march 6, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, completed a private
placement of $6.5 billion in unsecured and unsubordinated senior notes with
maturity dates from march 1, 2006 to march 1, 2031. the notes pay interest at
fixed rates ranging from 7.350% to 8.750% per annum, payable semi-annually and
include customary covenants. the notes include registration rights, such that
aws is required to exchange the notes for a new issue of notes registered under
the securities act of 1933 and are to be declared effective no later than 240
days after the issue date. at&amp;t; wireless group had $38 of interest expense for
the quarter ended march 31, 2001 related to those notes.

on march 23, 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, entered into competitive
advance and revolving credit facilities (the "facilities") in the aggregate
amount of $2.5 billion consisting of an up to $1.25 billion 364-day competitive
advance and revolving credit facility and an up to $1.25 billion five-year
competitive advance and revolving credit facility. the facilities are subject to
a facility fee ranging from 8 to 30 basis points, payable quarterly on the total
commitment, used or unused. the facility fees are based on the respective
agreement and will fluctuate based on at&amp;t; wireless group's senior notes rating.
the facilities are also subject to a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points if
borrowings exceed certain levels as defined in the agreement. the facilities
bear interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases, (i) libor plus
32.5 to 100 basis points depending on at&amp;t; wireless group's senior notes rating,
or (ii) the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus
50 basis points. the facilities are to be used for general corporate purposes
and are subject to customary covenants, representations and warranties and
events of default. in addition, the facilities contain financial covenants
requiring at&amp;t; wireless group to maintain certain financial ratios and prohibit
aws from declaring and/or paying dividends prior to the split-off. the
facilities also specifies limitations on at&amp;t;'s and at&amp;t; wireless group's
ability to consummate the split-off including a provision that it will
constitute an event of default if the split-off is consummated without obtaining
a favorable tax ruling from the irs or an unqualified tax opinion that the
split-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction. in addition, the existence of
an obligation by at&amp;t; wireless group to repurchase equity interests from docomo
may under certain circumstances constitute an event of default. no amounts had
been borrowed under the facilities at march 31, 2001.
<page>   68
in association with the intended split-off of at&amp;t; wireless group from at&amp;t;
announced on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; and at&amp;t; wireless services, inc. anticipate
that they will enter into a separation and distribution agreement that will
govern the terms of the split-off. as part of this agreement, at&amp;t; wireless
services will agree, upon completion of the split-off, to repay the full amount
of the principal and accrued but unpaid interest or face value and accrued but
unpaid dividends, of all outstanding indebtedness owned by at&amp;t; wireless group
to at&amp;t;, and all preferred stock in at&amp;t; wireless group held by at&amp;t.;

at&amp;t; performs cash management functions on behalf of at&amp;t; wireless group.
substantially all of at&amp;t; wireless group's cash balances are swept to at&amp;t; on a
daily basis, where they are managed and invested by at&amp;t.; prior to the offering
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock, transfers of cash to and from at&amp;t; were
reflected as a component of combined attributed net assets, with no interest
income or expense reflected. subsequent to the offering, transfers are reflected
as changes in the note receivable from or short-term debt payable to at&amp;t.; cash
balances maintained and reported by at&amp;t; wireless group primarily represent cash
balances for which no right of offset exists with at&amp;t.;

net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was $655 million, compared with $228 million for the same period in 2000.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a
$322 million increase in operating income excluding depreciation and
amortization, resulting from revenue growth and expense leveraging as well as an
increase in deferred income taxes. these increases were partially offset by a
larger decrease in payroll and benefit related liabilities for the three months
ended march 31, 2001, compared with the prior year. net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $12,519 million,
compared with $948 million for the three months ended march 31, 2000. the
increase was due primarily to the issuance of a note receivable from at&amp;t;
totaling $10,588 million, increased contributions into equity investments, and
higher capital expenditures to upgrade and increase network capacity. net cash
provided by financing activities for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$11,836 million, compared with $725 million for the three months ended march 31,
2000. the increase was primarily due to the $6.1 billion of net proceeds from
the docomo investment that at&amp;t; attributed to at&amp;t; wireless group, as well as
the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes,
partially offset by the repayment of the $638 million of short-term debt due
to at&amp;t.;

ebitda, defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, is the
primary measure used by the chief operating decision-makers to measure our
ability to generate cash flow. ebitda may or may not be consistent with the
calculation of ebitda for other public companies and should not be viewed by
investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles,
measures of performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities as a measure of liquidity.

ebitda for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was $717 million compared with
$395 million for the same period in 2000. the increase was primarily the result
of growth in services revenue, partially offset by increased customer
acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross consolidated subscriber
additions, increased network costs attributable to subscriber growth and the
related minutes of use, increased provision for uncollectible receivables, and
increased customer care and billing related expenses to support growth in the
subscriber base.

for the mobility business, ebitda for the three months ended march 31, 2001, was
$788 million compared with $431 million for the same period in 2000.
<page>   69
for the fixed wireless business, ebitda for the three months ended march 31,
2001, was a deficit of $68 million compared with a deficit of $34 million for
the same period in 2000.

ebitda margin, defined as ebitda as a percentage of total revenue, was 22.3% for
the first quarter of 2001, compared with 18.0% for the first quarter of 2000.
the improvement in ebitda margin was primarily due to revenue growth and expense
leveraging, primarily off-network roaming expenses, partially offset by
increased provision for uncollectible receivables.

ebitda margin for the mobility business was 24.5% for the first quarter of 2001
compared with 19.6% for the first quarter of 2000.

at&amp;t; wireless group financial condition

total assets were $47,039 million as of march 31, 2001, an increase of $11,737
million, or 33.2%, compared with december 31, 2000. the increase was due
primarily to an increase in the intercompany note receivable from at&amp;t; of
$10,588 million which resulted from at&amp;t; attributing $6.1 billion of the docomo
investment net proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group, and at&amp;t; wireless group loaning
the $6.3 billion of net proceeds from the senior notes to at&amp;t.; partially
offsetting these proceeds were the repayment of the $638 million of short-term
debt due to at&amp;t;, as well as capital expenditures and contributions made to
non-consolidated investments during the first quarter of 2001.

total liabilities were $16,060 million as of march 31, 2001, an increase of
$5,676 million, or 54.7%, compared with december 31, 2000. the increase was
primarily due to the issuance of the $6.5 billion of senior notes, as well as
increased operating accruals, partially offset by the repayment of $638 million
of short-term debt due to at&amp;t;, and decreases in payroll and benefit related
liabilities and accounts payable.

total combined attributed net assets was $30,937 million as of march 31, 2001,
an increase of $6,606 million, or 24.4%, compared with december 31, 2000. the
increase was primarily due to at&amp;t;'s attribution of the $6.1 billion of docomo
investment net proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group.

recent accounting pronouncements

in september 2000, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas
no. 140, "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities - a replacement of fasb no. 125". this statement
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. under these standards,
after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and
servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes
financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities
when extinguished. this statement provides consistent standards for
distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that
are secured borrowings. this statement is effective for transfers and servicing
of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march 31,
2001. at&amp;t; wireless group does not expect that the adoption of sfas no. 140 will
have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

at&amp;t; wireless group subsequent events

on april 27, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the sale of its entire interest in japan
telecom for approximately $1.35 billion in cash. at&amp;t; attributed $.5 billion of
the net after-tax proceeds from the sale to at&amp;t; wireless group. at&amp;t; wireless
group recognized an after-tax gain of $298 million associated with the
transaction, which was recorded in net equity earnings from investments in the
second quarter of 2001.

during the first quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; wireless group, through aws, made
unsecured term loans to rogers wireless to pay for spectrum it successfully bid
upon in the recently completed canadian spectrum auctions. in april 2001, rogers
wireless effected a rights offering of its equity securities in which at&amp;t;
wireless group's joint venture with british telecommunications, jvii,
participated. the participation increased jvii's ownership interest in rogers
wireless to 34.36%. at&amp;t; wireless group funded the purchase on behalf of jvii by
offsetting it against the unsecured, interest bearing note made by aws. this
transaction resulted in at&amp;t; wireless group obtaining a controlling interest of
jvii, as well as increasing the indirect ownership percentage in rogers
wireless. as a result of the consolidation of jvii, which holds the equity
interest in rogers wireless, at&amp;t; wireless group's investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, as well as minority interest liability, increased approximately
$420 million in april 2001.

                           part ii - other information

item 2c.  changes in securities and use of proceeds

on january 22, 2001, in a private placement transaction exempt from registration
pursuant to section 4(2) of the securities act of 1933, as amended, as a
transaction not involving a public offering, the company sold to ntt docomo for
an aggregate price of $9.8 billion newly issued at&amp;t; convertible preferred stock
and warrants.

the convertible preferred stock is convertible into 406 million shares of at&amp;t;
wireless group tracking stock at the option of ntt docomo. the warrants will be
exercisable in five years to purchase 41.7 million at&amp;t; wireless group tracking
stock at $35 per share.

consulting fees associated with the transaction of approximately $35 million
were paid to our financial advisors, salomon smith barney and credit suisse
first boston corporation, in association with the deal. the fees were discounted
from the proceeds from the convertible preferred stock and will be accreted
monthly for thirteen months. the company allocated $6.1 billion of the net
proceeds to at&amp;t; wireless group which will be used to continue executing its
strategy to expand its capacity, enlarge its footprint, create an advanced
mobile internet, and invest in other strategic growth initiatives, as well as to
satisfy intercompany obligations. the remaining proceeds from the deal was used
to reduce at&amp;t;'s debt.
