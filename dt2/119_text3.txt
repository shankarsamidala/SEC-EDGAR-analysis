statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the company’s
actual results to differ materially from the company’s
expectations.  the following factors, in addition to other possible
factors not listed, could cause the company’s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:  the
materially weakened financial condition of the company, resulting from its
significant losses in recent years; weaker demand for air travel and lower
investment asset returns resulting from the severe global economic downturn; the
company’s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on
acceptable terms; the ability of the company to generate additional revenues and
reduce its costs; continued high and volatile fuel prices and further increases
in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel; the company’s substantial
indebtedness and other obligations; the ability of the company to satisfy
existing financial or other covenants in certain of its credit agreements;
changes in economic and other conditions beyond the company’s control, and the
volatile results of the company’s operations; the fiercely and increasingly
competitive business environment faced by the company; potential industry
consolidation and alliance changes; competition with reorganized carriers; low
fare levels by historical standards and the company’s reduced pricing power;
changes in the company’s corporate or business strategy; government regulation
of the company’s business; conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks;
uncertainties with respect to the company’s international operations; outbreaks
of a disease (such as sars, avian flu or the h1n1 virus) that affects travel
behavior; labor costs that are higher than those of the company’s competitors;
uncertainties with respect to the company’s relationships with unionized and
other employee work groups; increased insurance costs and potential reductions
of available insurance coverage; the company’s ability to retain key management
personnel; potential failures or disruptions of the company’s computer,
communications or other technology systems; losses and adverse publicity
resulting from any accident involving the company’s aircraft; changes in the
price of the company’s common stock; and the ability of the company to reach
acceptable agreements with third parties.  additional information
concerning these and other factors is contained in the company’s securities and
exchange commission filings, including but not limited to the company’s 2008
form 10-k, as updated by the form 8-k and item 1a “risk factors” in this
quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30, 2009.</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman"><font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">the company’s ability to
become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an
ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely
beyond the company’s control.  </font>certain risk factors that affect
the company’s business and financial results are discussed in the risk factors
listed in item 1a in the 2008 form 10-k and <font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">as amended in item 1a in
this quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30,
2009</font>.  in addition, most of the company’s largest domestic
competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in the last
several years and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual
labor and other costs.  in order to remain competitive and to improve
its financial condition, the company must continue to take steps to generate
additional revenues and to reduce its costs.  although the company has
a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges,
some of these initiatives involve changes to the company’s business which it may
be unable to implement.  in addition, the company expects that, as
time goes on, it will be progressively more difficult to identify and implement
significant revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives.  the
adequacy and ultimate success of the company’s initiatives to generate
additional revenues and reduce costs are not known at this time and cannot be
assured. moreover, whether the company’s initiatives will be adequate or
successful depends in large measure on factors beyond its control, notably the
overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry
capacity growth, and fuel prices. it will be very difficult for the company to
continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to
profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve
substantially or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended
period at high levels.</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman"><font style="display: inline; font-family: times new roman">the company remains

2008 and 2009 (through the date of this filing), the company raised an aggregate
