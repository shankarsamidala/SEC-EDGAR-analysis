notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
(unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.       the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
         have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
         principles for interim financial information and with the instructions
         to form 10-q and article 10 of regulation s-x. accordingly, they do not
         include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
         accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. in
         the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all
         adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to
         present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash
         flows for the periods indicated. the company's 2002 results continue to
         be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. in
         addition, on april 9, 2001, american airlines, inc. (a wholly owned
         subsidiary of amr corporation) purchased substantially all of the
         assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc.
         (twa). accordingly, the operating results of twa are included in the
         accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the
         three-month period ended march 31, 2002 but not for the three-month
         period ended march 31, 2001. when utilized in this report, all
         references to american airlines, inc. include twa (collectively,
         american). results of operations for the periods presented herein are
         not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the entire
         year. for further information, refer to the consolidated financial
         statements and footnotes thereto included in the amr corporation (amr
         or the company) annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december
         31, 2001 ("2001 form 10-k"). certain amounts from 2001 have been
         reclassified to conform with the 2002 presentation.

2.       accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at march 31,
         2002 and december 31, 2001 was $8.9 billion. accumulated amortization
         of equipment and property under capital leases at march 31, 2002 and
         december 31, 2001 was $1.2 billion.

3.       the following table provides unaudited pro forma consolidated results
         of operations, assuming the acquisition of twa had occurred as of
         january 1, 2001 (in millions, except per share amounts):

         the unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have been
         prepared for comparative purposes only. these amounts are not

         transaction actually been consummated on the date indicated above and
         are not indicative of the consolidated results of operations which may
         occur in the future.

4.       as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
         included in the company's 2001 form 10-k, miami-dade county (the
         county) is currently investigating and remediating various
         environmental conditions at the miami international airport (mia) and
         funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost
         recovery methods. american and amr eagle have been named as potentially
         responsible parties (prps) for the contamination at mia. during the
         second quarter of 2001, the county filed a lawsuit against 17
         defendants, including american, in an attempt to recover its past and
         future cleanup costs (miami-dade county, florida v. advance cargo
         services, inc., et al. in the florida circuit court). in addition to
         the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and
         companies were also named as prps and contributors to the
         contamination. american's and amr eagle's portion of the cleanup costs
         cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the
         unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the
         proportion of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the
         responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding the environmental
         agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial activities and the
         nature of that supervision.

         in addition, the company is subject to environmental issues at various
         other airport and non-airport locations. management believes, after
         considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these
         environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the company's
         consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
         amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the company's
         current assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could
         increase or decrease as these assessments change.

5.       as of march 31, 2002, the company had commitments to acquire the
         following aircraft: 47 boeing 737-800s, 12 boeing 777-200ers, nine
         boeing 767-300ers, one boeing 757-200, 117 embraer regional jets and 22
         bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to
         continue through 2008. payments for these aircraft are expected to be
         approximately $825 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.7 billion
         in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $1.9
         billion in 2005 through 2008.

6.       during the three-month period ended march 31, 2002, american and amr
         eagle borrowed approximately $348 million under various debt agreements
         which are secured by aircraft. effective interest rates on these
         agreements are based on london interbank offered rate plus a spread and
         mature over various periods of time through 2018.

         in march 2002, the regional airports improvement corporation issued
         facilities sublease revenue bonds at the los angeles international
         airport to provide reimbursement to american for certain facility
         construction costs. the proceeds of approximately $215 million provided
         to american have been recorded as long-term debt on the condensed
         consolidated balance sheets. these obligations bear interest at fixed
         rates, with an average rate of 7.88 percent, and mature over various
         periods of time, with a final maturity in 2024.

7.       effective january 1, 2002, the company adopted statement of financial
         accounting standards no. 142, "goodwill and other intangible assets"
         (sfas 142). sfas 142 requires the company to test goodwill and
         indefinite-lived intangible assets (for amr, route acquisition costs)
         for impairment rather than amortize them. during the first quarter of
         2002, the company completed its impairment analysis for route
         acquisition costs in accordance with sfas 142. the analysis did not
         result in an impairment charge. in addition, the company completed its
         impairment analysis related to its $1.4 billion of goodwill and
         determined the company's entire goodwill balance was impaired. in
         arriving at this conclusion, the company's net book value was
         determined to be in excess of the company's fair value at january 1,
         2002, using amr as the reporting unit for purposes of the fair value
         determination. the company determined its fair value as of january 1,
         2002 using various valuation methods, ultimately utilizing market
         capitalization as the primary indicator of fair value. as a result, the
         company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge, effective january 1,
         2002, of $988 million ($6.38 per share, net of a tax benefit of $363
         million) to write-off all of amr's goodwill. this charge is
         nonoperational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of
         accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations. this
         charge does not affect the company's financial covenants in any of its
         credit agreements.


         in addition, effective january 1, 2001, the company adopted statement
         of financial accounting standards no. 133, "accounting for derivative
         instruments and hedging activities", as amended (sfas 133). sfas 133
         required the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet
         at fair value. derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair
         value through income. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
         nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are
         either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
         liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
         other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
         earnings. the ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair
         value is immediately recognized in earnings. the adoption of sfas 133
         did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment being recorded to net
         income for the change in accounting. however, the company recorded a
         transition adjustment of approximately $64 million in accumulated other
         comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2001.

</c></c></s></caption></table>

         airport operating and gate lease rights are being amortized on a
         straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual value. for the
         three-month period ended march 31, 2002, the company recorded
         amortization expense of approximately $9 million related to these
         intangible assets. the company expects to record annual amortization
         expense of approximately $29 million in each of the next five years
         related to these intangible assets.

         the pro forma effect of sfas 142 - assuming the company had adopted
         this standard as of january 1, 2001 - is immaterial to the company's
         net loss and loss per share for the three-month period ended march 31,
         2001.

8.       the company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
         securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in the
         fair value of certain derivative financial instruments that qualify for
         hedge accounting in comprehensive income (loss). for the three months
         ended march 31, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive income (loss) was $(1,488)
         million and $31 million, respectively. the difference between net loss
         and comprehensive loss for the three months ended march 31, 2002 is due
         primarily to the accounting for the company's derivative financial
         instruments under sfas 133. the difference between net loss and
         comprehensive income for the three months ended march 31, 2001 was due
         primarily to the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas 133 and the
         accounting for the company's derivative financial instruments under
         sfas 133.

item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

results of operations

for the three months ended march 31, 2002 and 2001

summary amr corporation's (amr or the company) loss before cumulative effect of
accounting change during the first quarter of 2002 was $575 million, or $3.71
per share, as compared to a net loss of $43 million, or $0.28 per share for the
same period in 2001. amr's operating loss of $729 million increased $725 million
compared to the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be
adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. in addition, on
april 9, 2001, american airlines, inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of amr)
purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
trans world airlines, inc. (twa). accordingly, the operating results of twa are
included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the
three-month period ended march 31, 2002 but not for the three-month period ended
march 31, 2001. all references to american airlines, inc. include twa
(collectively, american). in addition, effective january 1, 2002, the company
recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $988 million (net of tax), reflected as
a cumulative effect of accounting change, to write-off all of amr's goodwill.

although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity
since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's first quarter 2002
revenues were down significantly year-over-year. in addition to the residual
effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively
impacted by the economic slowdown -- seen largely in business travel declines --
and an increase in fare sale activity. in total, the company's revenues
decreased $624 million, or 13.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2002 from the
same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 11.5 percent,
or $451 million in the first three months of 2002 from the same period in 2001.
american's domestic revenue per available seat mile (rasm) decreased 15.4
percent, to 8.7 cents, on a capacity increase of 9.4 percent, to 29.3 billion
available seat miles (asms). international rasm decreased to 8.66 cents, or 10.6
percent, on a capacity decrease of 11.4 percent. the decrease in international
rasm was due to a 14.1 percent decrease and 11.9 percent decrease in european
and latin american rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 9 percent increase
in pacific rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 39.5
percent, 13.9 percent and 4 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin
american asms, respectively.

amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 13.8 percent, or $49 million. amr
eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent while capacity decreased 1.3 percent, to
approximately 1.6 billion asms. as with american, the decrease in amr eagle's
revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the september 11, 2001
terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown.

cargo revenues decreased $42 million, or 23.9 percent, for the same reasons as
noted above.

other revenues decreased 27.8 percent, or $82 million, due primarily to
decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other
airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service
charges.

the company's operating expenses increased 2.1 percent, or $101 million.
american's cost per asm increased 0.4 percent to 11.30 cents. wages, salaries
and benefits increased 19.1 percent, or $334 million, primarily due to
contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's
labor contracts. in addition, the company experienced increases in its pension
and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care
and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 25.5 percent, or
$180 million, due primarily to a 23.3 percent decrease in the company's average
price per gallon of fuel. other rentals and landing fees increased 12.5 percent,
or $32 million, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees across american's
system. aircraft rentals increased $78 million, or 52.7 percent, due primarily
to the addition of twa aircraft. commissions to agents decreased 28.1 percent,
or $63 million, due primarily to an 11.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues
and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. other operating
expenses decreased 11 percent, or $100 million, due primarily to decreases in
contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and
decreases in travel and incidental costs, advertising and promotion costs, and
credit card fees, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security
costs.

other income (expense), historically a net expense, increased $81 million due to
the following: interest income decreased 55 percent, or $22 million, due
primarily to decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased $47
million, or 39.5 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's
long-term debt. interest capitalized decreased $19 million, or 46.3 percent, due
primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.
miscellaneous-net decreased 46.7 percent, or $7 million, due to the write-down
of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2001.

the effective tax rate for the three months ended march 31, 2002 was impacted by
a $27 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus
package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses (nols).
this change allows the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years,
rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the company to more
quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did, however, result in the
displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now
expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this
charge.

(2)      the boeing 727-200 fleet will be removed from service by may 2002.

the average aircraft age for american's aircraft is 9.9 years and 6.6 years for
amr eagle aircraft.

in addition, the following owned and leased aircraft were not operated by the
company as of march 31, 2002: 19 owned boeing 727-200s, 15 operating leased
mcdonnell douglas dc-9s, 19 operating leased boeing 717-200s, nine owned
mcdonnell douglas dc-10-10s, four operating leased mcdonnell douglas md-80s,
three owned mcdonnell douglas md-11s, two owned mcdonnell douglas dc-10-30s, and
four owned, six capital leased and two operating leased saab 340bs.

liquidity and capital resources

net cash used for operating activities in the three-month period ended march 31,
2002 was $406 million, an increase of $425 million over the same period in 2001,
due primarily to an increase in the company's net loss. capital expenditures for
the first three months of 2002 were $619 million, and included the acquisition
of six boeing 757-200s, two boeing 777-200ers, seven embraer 140s and two
bombardier crj-700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily
through secured mortgage and debt agreements.

as of march 31, 2002, the company had commitments to acquire the following
aircraft: 47 boeing 737-800s, 12 boeing 777-200ers, nine boeing 767-300ers, one
boeing 757-200, 117 embraer regional jets and 22 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries
of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through 2008. payments for these
aircraft are expected to be approximately $825 million during the remainder of
2002, $1.7 billion in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of
approximately $1.9 billion in 2005 through 2008.

other information

in addition to the company's approximately $2.3 billion in cash and short-term
investments as of march 31, 2002, the company has available a variety of future
financing sources, including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of the
remainder of the u.s. government grant authorized by the air transportation
safety and system stabilization act (the act), which is estimated to be in
excess of $100 million, (ii) additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) the
availability of the company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback
transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, (v) the
recovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in the
recently passed economic stimulus package regarding nol carrybacks (in april
2002, the company received approximately $393 million related to the utilization
of its remaining 2001 nol), (vi) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities,
(vii) securitization of future operating receipts, (viii) unsecured borrowings,
and (ix) borrowings backed by federal loan guarantees as provided under the act.
no assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available
on terms acceptable to the company. however, the company believes it will meet
its current financing needs.

as a result of the september 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to
commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or
passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events
(war-risk coverage). at the same time, they significantly increased the premiums
for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. pursuant to
authority granted in the act, the government has supplemented the commercial
war-risk insurance until may 19, 2002 with a third party liability policy to
cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable 60-day
periods. in the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount of
insurance coverage available or the government fails to renew war-risk
insurance, the company's operations and/or financial position, results of
operations or cash flows would be adversely impacted.

as discussed in the company's 2001 form 10-k, a provision in the current allied
pilots association contract further limits the number of asms and block hours
flown by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on
furlough. as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets,
this will cause the asm cap to be reached sometime in the first half of 2002,
necessitating actions to comply with that cap. american is working with its
regional partners to ensure that it is in compliance with this provision.
actions currently being taken and considered by amr eagle to reduce its capacity
are discussed in the company's 2001 form 10-k. in addition, american is removing
its code from flights of the american connection carriers, which are independent
carriers that provide feed to american's st. louis hub. american believes that
the combination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the asm cap
through 2002 and for sometime beyond.

outlook

capacity for american is expected to be down approximately 11 percent in the
second quarter of 2002 compared to last year's second quarter levels. amr
eagle's second quarter capacity will be down about three percent from last
year's levels. for the second quarter of 2002, the company expects traffic to be
lower by approximately 11 percent as compared to last year's second quarter
levels. pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the company will
continue to see higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs
and insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. although the company
expects to see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of
2002, fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second quarter of 2002 as
compared to last year's second quarter prices. further, the company expects to
see a benefit in commission expense due to the domestic base commission changes
implemented in march 2002. in total however, american's unit costs for the
second quarter of 2002 are expected to be two to three percent higher than last
year's second quarter. given this higher unit cost, coupled with the revenue
pressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into the second
quarter, the company expects to incur a loss in the second quarter (although the
company does not expect this loss to be of the same magnitude as the company's
first quarter loss), and will likely incur a loss for 2002.

item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided
in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the
company's 2001 form 10-k.

item 4. controls and procedures

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
the company's management, including the chief executive officer (ceo) and chief
financial officer (cfo), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
company's disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days before the filing
date of this quarterly report (october 18, 2002). based on that evaluation, the
company's management, including the ceo and cfo, concluded that the company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. there have been no
significant changes in the company's internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their evaluation.

part ii:  other information

item 1.  legal proceedings

on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american airlines, inc.,
amr eagle holding corporation, airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre
group holdings, inc. in the united states district court for the central
district of california, western division (westways world travel, inc. v. amr
corp., et al.). the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit
memos to american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between american and amr
eagle and the plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment, and (3) violates
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico). the as
yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will be
required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations
from july 26, 1995 to the present. the plaintiffs seek to enjoin american from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. the company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. although the company believes that the
litigation is without merit, an adverse court decision could impose restrictions
on the company's relationships with travel agencies which restrictions could
have an adverse impact on the company.

on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division of the
department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr
eagle holding corporation in federal court in wichita, kansas. the lawsuit
alleges that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on
american to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. on april 27, 2001,
the u.s. district court for the district of kansas granted american's motion for
summary judgment. on june 26, 2001, the u.s. department of justice appealed the
granting of american's motion for summary judgment. the parties have submitted
briefs to the 10th circuit court of appeals. no date has been set for oral
argument. the company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. a final adverse
court decision imposing restrictions on the company's ability to respond to
competitors would have an adverse impact on the company.

<page>


item 1. legal proceedings (continued)

between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were filed
against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding
corporation in the united states district court in wichita, kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees (king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et
al.; team electric v. amr corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier
v. amr corp., et al.; wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl v. amr corp.,
et al.). collectively, these lawsuits allege that american unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
by increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. two of the suits (smith and wright) also allege
that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions
on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering override
commissions to travel agents. the suits propose to certify several classes of
consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased tickets for air
travel on american into or out of dfw from 1995 to the present. on november 10,
1999, the district court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the
case brought by the department of justice. as a result, to date no class has
been certified. the company intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. one or
more final adverse court decisions imposing restrictions on the company's
ability to respond to competitors or awarding substantial money damages would
have an adverse impact on the company.

on january 30, 2002, the named plaintiff in hall v. united airlines, et al., no.
7:00 cv 123-br(1), pending in the united states district court for the eastern
district of north carolina, filed an amended complaint alleging that between
1997 and the present, american and the other defendant airlines conspired to
reduce commissions paid to u.s.-based travel agents in violation of section 1 of
the sherman act. the named plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of
travel agents, but no class has yet been certified. american is vigorously
defending the lawsuit. a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money
damages would have an adverse impact on the company.

miami-dade county (the county) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the miami international airport (mia) and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. american airlines, inc. and amr eagle have been named as potentially
responsible parties (prps) for the contamination at mia. during the second
quarter of 2001, the county filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including
american airlines, inc., in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup
costs (miami-dade county, florida v. advance cargo services, inc., et al. in the
florida circuit court). in addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit,
243 other agencies and companies were also named as prps and contributors to the
contamination. american's and amr eagle's portion of the cleanup costs cannot be
reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that will
ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties
regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial
activities and the nature of that supervision. the company is vigorously
defending the lawsuit.

item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided
in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the
company's 2001 form 10-k.

item 4. controls and procedures

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
the company's management, including the chief executive officer (ceo) and chief
financial officer (cfo), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
company's disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days before the filing
date of this quarterly report (october 18, 2002). based on that evaluation, the
company's management, including the ceo and cfo, concluded that the company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. there have been no
significant changes in the company's internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their evaluation.

part ii:  other information

item 1.  legal proceedings

on july 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in november 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against amr corporation, american airlines, inc.,
amr eagle holding corporation, airlines reporting corporation, and the sabre
group holdings, inc. in the united states district court for the central
district of california, western division (westways world travel, inc. v. amr
corp., et al.). the lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit
memos to american for violations of american's fare rules (by customers of the
agencies) (1) breaches the agent reporting agreement between american and amr
eagle and the plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment, and (3) violates
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 (rico). the as
yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will be
required to pay monies to american for debit memos for fare rules violations
from july 26, 1995 to the present. the plaintiffs seek to enjoin american from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. the company
intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. although the company believes that the
litigation is without merit, an adverse court decision could impose restrictions
on the company's relationships with travel agencies which restrictions could
have an adverse impact on the company.

on may 13, 1999, the united states (through the antitrust division of the
department of justice) sued amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr
eagle holding corporation in federal court in wichita, kansas. the lawsuit
alleges that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. the department of justice seeks to enjoin american
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on
american to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. on april 27, 2001,
the u.s. district court for the district of kansas granted american's motion for
summary judgment. on june 26, 2001, the u.s. department of justice appealed the
granting of american's motion for summary judgment. the parties have submitted
briefs to the 10th circuit court of appeals. no date has been set for oral
argument. the company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. a final adverse
court decision imposing restrictions on the company's ability to respond to
competitors would have an adverse impact on the company.



                                      -12-

item 1. legal proceedings (continued)

between may 14, 1999 and june 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were filed
against amr corporation, american airlines, inc., and amr eagle holding
corporation in the united states district court in wichita, kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees (king v. amr corp., et al.; smith v. amr corp., et
al.; team electric v. amr corp., et al.; warren v. amr corp., et al.; whittier
v. amr corp., et al.; wright v. amr corp., et al.; and youngdahl v. amr corp.,
et al.). collectively, these lawsuits allege that american unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from dfw
by increasing service when new competitors began flying to dfw, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. two of the suits (smith and wright) also allege
that american unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from dfw by offering discounted fares to corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions
on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering override
commissions to travel agents. the suits propose to certify several classes of
consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased tickets for air
travel on american into or out of dfw from 1995 to the present. on november 10,
1999, the district court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the
case brought by the department of justice. as a result, to date no class has
been certified. the company intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. one or
more final adverse court decisions imposing restrictions on the company's
ability to respond to competitors or awarding substantial money damages would
have an adverse impact on the company.

on january 30, 2002, the named plaintiff in hall v. united airlines, et al., no.
7:00 cv 123-br(1), pending in the united states district court for the eastern
district of north carolina, filed an amended complaint alleging that between
1997 and the present, american and the other defendant airlines conspired to
reduce commissions paid to u.s.-based travel agents in violation of section 1 of
the sherman act. the named plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of
travel agents, but no class has yet been certified. american is vigorously
defending the lawsuit. a final adverse court decision awarding substantial money
damages would have an adverse impact on the company.

miami-dade county (the county) is currently investigating and remediating
various environmental conditions at the miami international airport (mia) and
funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various cost recovery
methods. american airlines, inc. and amr eagle have been named as potentially
responsible parties (prps) for the contamination at mia. during the second
quarter of 2001, the county filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including
american airlines, inc., in an attempt to recover its past and future cleanup
costs (miami-dade county, florida v. advance cargo services, inc., et al. in the
florida circuit court). in addition to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit,
243 other agencies and companies were also named as prps and contributors to the
contamination. american's and amr eagle's portion of the cleanup costs cannot be
reasonably estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that will
ultimately be recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties
regarding the environmental agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial
activities and the nature of that supervision. the company is vigorously
defending the lawsuit.
