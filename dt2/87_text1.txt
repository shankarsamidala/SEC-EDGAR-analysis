                       management's discussion and analysis of
                    results of operations and financial condition
overview

at&amp;t; corp. (at&amp;t;) is among the world's communications leaders, providing voice,
data, video and broadband telecommunications services to large and small
businesses, consumers and government agencies. we provide domestic and
international long distance; regional and local communications services; cable
television and internet communications services. we also provide directory and
calling-card services to support our communications business.

tracking stocks

a tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders based
on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks.
ownership of shares of at&amp;t; common stock, at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock or
liberty media class a or b tracking stock did not represent a direct legal
interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups, but an ownership of
at&amp;t; in total. the specific shares represented an interest in the economic
performance of the net assets of each of the groups.

at&amp;t; wireless group was an integrated business of at&amp;t; and liberty media group
was a combination of certain assets and businesses of at&amp;t;, neither of which was
a stand-alone entity at june 30, 2001. subsequent to june 30, 2001, both of
these groups have been split-off from at&amp;t.;


restructuring of at&amp;t;

on october 25, 2000, at&amp;t; announced a restructuring plan designed to fully
separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial
performance and economic value of each of at&amp;t;'s four major operating units. if
the plan is completed as announced, at&amp;t; wireless, at&amp;t; broadband, at&amp;t; business
and at&amp;t; consumer would all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.

on july 8, 2001, comcast corp. (comcast) made an unsolicited offer to acquire
at&amp;t; broadband. on july 18, at&amp;t;'s board of directors unanimously voted to
reject comcast's proposal to acquire at&amp;t; broadband. the board has directed
management to explore financial and strategic alternatives relating to at&amp;t;
broadband, including the previously announced restructuring plans, with the goal
to provide the greatest long-term value to shareowners. the board also decided
to delay finalizing and mailing to shareowners the proxy materials, filed
preliminary with the sec on july 3, 2001, for its current restructuring plans.
however, at&amp;t; remains committed to separate at&amp;t; consumer and at&amp;t; business from
at&amp;t; broadband and to create a separate tracking stock designed to represent the
financial performance of at&amp;t; consumer.

on may 25, 2001, at&amp;t; completed an exchange offer of at&amp;t; common stock for at&amp;t;
wireless stock. under the terms of the exchange offer, at&amp;t; issued 1.176 shares
of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock in exchange for each share of at&amp;t; common
stock validly tendered. a total of 372.2 million shares of at&amp;t; common stock
were tendered in exchange for 437.7 million shares of at&amp;t; wireless group
tracking stock.

on july 9, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the split-off of at&amp;t; wireless as a separate,
independently-traded company. all at&amp;t; wireless tracking stock was converted
into at&amp;t; wireless common stock on a one-for-one basis and 1,136 million shares
of at&amp;t; wireless common stock, held by at&amp;t;, were distributed to at&amp;t; common
shareowners on a basis of 0.3218 of a share of at&amp;t; wireless for each at&amp;t; share
outstanding. at&amp;t; common shareowners received whole shares of at&amp;t; wireless and
cash payments for fractional shares. the internal revenue

<page>   35
service (irs) ruled that the transaction qualified as tax-free for at&amp;t; and its
shareowners for u.s. federal income tax purposes, with the exception of cash
received for fractional shares. at&amp;t; retained approximately $3 billion, or 7.3%,
of at&amp;t; wireless common stock, about half of which was used in a debt-for-equity
exchange in july. the remaining shares will be sold, exchanged or monetized
within the next six months. at&amp;t; wireless will continue trading on the new york
stock exchange (nyse) under the symbol "awe".

on august 10, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the split-off of liberty media corporation as
an independent, publicly-traded company. at&amp;t; redeemed each outstanding share of
class a and class b liberty media group (lmg) tracking stock for one share of
liberty media corporation's series a and series b common stock, respectively. in
the redemption, shares of liberty media corporation were issued to former
holders of liberty media group tracking stock in exchange for their shares of
liberty media group tracking stock. the irs ruled that the split-off of liberty
media corporation qualified as a tax-free transaction for at&amp;t;, liberty media
and their shareowners. liberty media corporation's series a common stock and
series b common stock is now listed on the nyse under the symbols "lmc.a" and
"lmc.b", respectively.

at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan is complicated and involves a substantial number of
steps and transactions, including obtaining various conditions, such as internal
revenue service rulings. at&amp;t; expects that the transactions associated with
at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan will be tax-free to u.s. shareowners. in addition,
future financial conditions, superior alternatives or other factors may arise or
occur that make it inadvisable to proceed with part or all of at&amp;t;'s
restructuring plans. any or all of the elements of at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan may
not occur as we currently expect or in the time frames that we currently
contemplate, or at all. alternative forms of restructuring, including sales of
interests in these businesses, would reduce what is available for distribution
to shareowners in the restructuring.

forward-looking statements

this document may contain forward-looking statements with respect to at&amp;t;'s
restructuring plan, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
dividends, financing plans, business strategies, operating efficiencies or
synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, network build out and
upgrade, competitive positions, availability of capital, growth opportunities
for existing products, benefits from new technologies, availability and
deployment of new technologies, plans and objectives of management, and other
matters.

these forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating
to the future business prospects, revenue, working capital, liquidity, capital
needs, network build out, interest costs and income, are necessarily estimates
reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number of risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those suggested by the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking
statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements including, without
limitation:

- -   the risks associated with the implementation of at&amp;t;'s restructuring plan,
    which is complicated and involves a substantial number of different
    transactions each with separate conditions, any or all of which may not
    occur as we currently intend, or which may not occur in the timeframe we
    currently expect,

- -   the risks associated with each of at&amp;t;'s main business units, operating as
    independent entities as opposed to as part of an integrated
    telecommunications provider following completion of at&amp;t;'s restructuring
    plan, including the inability of these groups to rely on the financial and
    operational resources of the combined company and these groups having to
    provide services that were previously provided by a different part of the
    combined company,

- -   the impact of existing and new competitors in the markets in which these
    groups compete, including competitors that may offer less expensive products
    and services, desirable or innovative products, technological substitutes,
    or have extensive resources or better financing,

- -   the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting from excessive deployment of
    network capacity,

- -   the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in the
    telecommunications industry, which may have the effect of making the
    competitors of these entities larger and better financed and afford these
    competitors with extensive resources and greater geographic reach, allowing
    them to compete more effectively,

- -   the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which the company
    operates, which may decrease prices charged, increase churn and change
    customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,

- -   the ability to establish a significant market presence in new geographic and
    service markets,

- -   the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of increased
    leverage,

- -   the successful execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic assets as part
    of an overall corporate deleveraging plan,

<page>   37

- -   the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of the
    business strategies of the company,

- -   the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to competitors
    by the federal communications commission (fcc) or state regulatory
    commissions under the telecommunications act of 1996 or other applicable
    laws and regulations,

- -   the risks associated with technological requirements, technology
    substitution and changes and other technological developments,

- -   the results of litigation filed or to be filed against the company,

- -   the possibility of one or more of the markets in which the company competes
    being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors, such as
    monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over
    which these groups have no control, and

- -   the risks related to at&amp;t;'s joint ventures.

similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this document. moreover, in the future, at&amp;t;,
through its senior management, may make forward-looking statements about the
matters described in this document or other matters concerning at&amp;t.;

the discussion and analysis that follows provides information management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of at&amp;t;'s consolidated
results of operations for the three and six months ended june 30, 2001 and 2000,
and financial condition as of june 30, 2001 and december 31, 2000.

consolidated results of operations

the comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2001 results with the
corresponding periods in 2000 was impacted by events, such as acquisitions and
dispositions, that occurred during these two years. for example, on june 15,
2000, we acquired mediaone, which was included in our second quarter and
year-to-date 2001 results, but was only included in our prior year results since
date of acquisition.

year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of at home
corporation (excite@home) beginning september 1, 2000, due to
corporate-governance changes, which gave at&amp;t; a controlling interest. on june
30, 2001, we had an approximate 23% economic interest and 74% voting interest in
excite@home. the consolidation of excite@home resulted in the inclusion of 100%
of its results in each line item of at&amp;t;'s consolidated balance sheet and
consolidated statement of operations. the approximate 77% we do not own is
reflected within "minority interest" in the consolidated balance sheets and as a
component of "minority interest income (expense)" in the consolidated statement
of operations for the three and six months ended june 30, 2001. for the three
and six months ended june 30, 2000, our ownership interest in excite@home was
accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with earnings or losses
included as a component of "net losses from other equity investments" in the
consolidated statement of operations.

effective july 1, 2000, the federal communication commission (fcc) eliminated
primary interexchange carrier charges (picc or per-line charges) that at&amp;t; pays
for residential and single-line businesses. the elimination of these per-line
charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue, since at&amp;t;
has historically billed its customers for these charges.

total revenue for the three months ended june 30, 2001 decreased 3.0%, or $0.4
billion, compared with the corresponding prior year period. the decline was
primarily driven by lower revenue resulting from accelerating declines in long
distance voice revenue. partially offsetting the decrease was revenue of
approximately $0.4 billion due to the net impact of acquisitions, the
consolidation of excite@home, the elimination of picc and dispositions. also
offsetting the decline was growth from new services at at&amp;t; broadband and data
and internet protocol (ip) within at&amp;t; business.

total revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2001 decreased 2.1%, or $0.6
billion, compared with the corresponding prior year period. the decline was
primarily driven by accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue.
partially offsetting the decline was revenue of approximately $0.9 billion due
to the net impact of acquisitions, the consolidation of excite@home, the
elimination of picc and dispositions. also offsetting the decline was growth
from data and internet protocol (ip) within at&amp;t; business and new services at
at&amp;t; broadband.


we expect long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing
competition and product substitution.

costs of services and products increased $0.4 billion, or 13.3%, in the second

costs of services and products increased $1.0 billion, or 17.0%, for the first
half of 2001 compared with the first half of 2000. approximately $1.0 billion of
the increase was driven by net acquisitions, primarily mediaone, and the impact
of consolidating excite@home. also contributing to the increase was higher costs
associated with our growth businesses, primarily in our outsourcing and
broadband business, of approximately $0.2 billion, partially offset by $0.2
billion of our cost reduction efforts, lower costs associated with lower volumes
from our international ventures and lower payphone compensation cost.

during the second quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; recorded $287 million of net
restructuring and other charges. included in these charges were $56 million of
asset impairment charges related to excite@home including the write-off of
property, plant and equipment, and $231 million for restructuring and exits
costs, which consisted of $88 of million for severance costs, $136 million
related to facility closings and $7 million primarily related to termination of
contractual obligations.

the severance costs, for approximately 4,500 employees, primarily resulted from
synergies created by the mediaone merger. approximately 27% of the affected
employees are management employees and 73% are non-management employees.

net restructuring and other charges for the six months ended june 30, 2001,
totaled $1,095 million. the charge includes $795 million of asset impairment
charges related to excite@home, $300 million for restructuring and exit costs
which consisted of $147 million for severance costs, $142 million for facilities
closing and $11 million primarily related to termination of contractual
obligations.

the asset impairment charges included $600 million recorded by excite@home
associated with goodwill impairment of various acquisitions, primarily excite,
and a related goodwill impairment charge of $139 million recorded by at&amp;t;
associated with its acquisition goodwill of excite@home. the impairment resulted
from the continued weakness of the online media market that excite@home operates
in. since we consolidate, but only own approximately 23% of excite@home, 77% of
the charge recorded by excite@home was not included as a reduction to at&amp;t;'s net
income, but rather eliminated in our june 30, 2001 consolidated statement of
operations as a component of "minority interest income (expense)." in the second
quarter of 2001, excite@home recorded an additional $56 million of asset
impairment charges related to the write-off of property, plant and equipment.

the severance costs, for approximately 6,900 employees, primarily resulted from
synergies created by the mediaone merger. approximately 21% of the affected
employees are management employees and 79% are non-management employees.

this restructuring initiative is projected to yield cash savings of
approximately $93 million in 2001 (net of severance benefit pay-outs of
approximately $147 million) and approximately $340 million per year thereafter.
the initiative will yield no ebit savings, net of restructuring charges in 2001,
and is projected to yield approximately $340 million per year thereafter. we
expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cash
and ebit savings. the ebit savings, primarily attributable to reduced
personnel-related expenses, will be realized in costs of services and products
and sg&amp;a; expenses.

during the six months ended june 30, 2000, at&amp;t; recorded $773 million of net
restructuring and other charges, which included $682 million for restructuring
and exit costs associated with at&amp;t;'s initiative to reduce costs by the end of
2000, and $91 million related to the government-mandated disposition of at&amp;t;
communications (u.k.) ltd., which would have competed directly with concert.

included in restructuring and exit costs was $458 million of cash termination
benefits associated with the involuntary separation of approximately 6,200
employees. approximately one-half of the individuals were management employees
and one-half were non-management employees.

we also recorded $62 million of network lease and other contract termination
costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the
termination of these contracts during the first quarter 2000.

also included in restructuring and exit costs was $144 million of benefit
curtailment costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit
plans. we also recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 million related to the
write-down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesses in which the carrying
value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.

operating income decreased $1.8 billion, or 56.6%, in the second quarter of 2001
compared with the second quarter of 2000. operating income decreased $3.3
billion, or 60.3%, for the first half of 2001 compared with the first half of
2000. approximately $0.5 billion of the second quarter decrease and
approximately one-half of the year-to-date decrease was due to the acquisition
of mediaone and the consolidation of excite@home, including the impact of
restructuring and other charges. the remaining decrease reflects the impact of
the declining long distance voice business and spending in growth areas, which
has resulted in lower revenue and higher expenses. in addition, the year-to-date
decrease was partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges. a
majority of the impact of the operating loss generated by excite@home was offset
in minority interest income (expense), reflecting the approximate 77% of
excite@home we do not own.

other income (expense) for the second quarter of 2001 was an expense of $1.4
billion, an increase in expense of $1.8 billion from the second quarter of 2000.
the increase in expense was primarily driven by an impairment charge of
approximately $1.1 billion due to a pretax write-down to market of our
investment in net2phone and a $0.8 billion loss on the excite@home put

<page>   43
obligation settlement with cox communications (cox), inc. and comcast partially
offset by higher net gains on the sales of businesses and investments of $0.3
billion. net gains in 2001 included a gain on the sale of our stake in japan
telecom of approximately $0.5 billion, a gain on the sale of an entity owning
baltimore cable-systems to comcast of approximately $0.1 billion and a loss on
the redemption of at&amp;t; stock held by comcast in exchange for an entity owning
cable-systems of approximately $0.3 billion.

other income (expense) for the first half of 2001 was an expense of $2.2
billion, an increase in expense of $3.2 billion compared with the same period in
2000. the higher expense was in part driven by impairment charges of
approximately $1.3 billion primarily relating to our investment in net2phone. in
addition, effective january 1, 2001, in conjunction with the adoption of sfas
no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities", we
reclassified certain investment securities, which support debt that is indexed
to those securities, from "available-for-sale" to "trading." as a result, we
recorded a pretax charge of $0.9 billion in other income reflecting the initial
reclassification impact of the adoption of sfas no. 133 as well as the ongoing
investment and derivative revaluation. also contributing to the higher expense
was a $0.8 billion loss on the excite@home put obligation settlement with cox
and comcast, and $0.1 billion of lower net gains on the sale of businesses and
investments.

billion, for the six months ended june 30, 2001, compared with the same period
in 2000. the increase in both periods was largely due to the higher average debt
balance primarily as a result of our june 2000 acquisition of mediaone,
including outstanding debt of mediaone and debt issued to fund the mediaone
acquisition. the impact of mediaone was partially offset by the company's debt
reduction efforts in 2001.

the provision for income taxes decreased $2.0 billion, or 179.6%, to a benefit
of $0.9 billion in the second quarter of 2001 compared with a provision of $1.1
billion in the second quarter of 2000. the decrease was primarily due to a net
loss before income taxes in second quarter of 2001, compared with earnings
before income taxes in the second quarter of 2000. the effective tax rate for
the second quarter of 2001 was 103.3%, compared with 37.5% for the prior year
second quarter. the second quarter effective tax benefit rate increased
primarily due to the net tax benefits resulting from the excite@home put
obligation settlement with cox and comcast and the redemption of at&amp;t; stock held
by comcast in exchange for certain cable systems. these impacts were partially
offset by the consolidation of operational loss of excite@home, for which the
company is unable to record tax benefits, and higher non tax-deductible goodwill
amortization versus the second quarter of 2000.

the provision for income taxes decreased $2.2 billion, or 141.0%, to a benefit
of $0.7 billion for the six months ended june 30, 2001 compared with a provision
of $1.6 billion for the same period in 2000. the decrease was primarily due to a
net loss before income taxes for the six months ended june 30, 2001, compared
with earnings before income taxes for the same prior year period. the effective
tax rate for the six months ended june 30, 2001 was 38.6%, compared with 29.6%
for the same period in 2000. the 2001 effective tax benefit rate increased
primarily due to the net tax benefits resulting from the excite@home put
obligation settlement with cox and comcast and the redemption of at&amp;t; stock held
by comcast in exchange for certain cable systems. these impacts were partially
offset by a non tax-deductible asset impairment charge recorded by excite@home,
the consolidation of operational loss of excite@home, for which the company is
unable to record tax benefits and higher non tax-deductible goodwill
amortization. the 2000 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax-free
gain resulting from an exchange of at&amp;t; stock for an entity owning certain cable
systems and other assets with cox and the benefit of the write-off of the
related deferred tax liability.

minority interest income (expense), which is recorded net of income taxes,
represents an adjustment to at&amp;t;'s income to reflect the less than 100%
ownership of consolidated subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
issued by subsidiaries of at&amp;t.; the company recorded $0.2 billion of minority
interest income in the second quarter of 2001 and $46 million of minority
interest expense in the second quarter of 2000. minority interest income
(expense) was $0.8 billion of income for the six months ended june 30, 2001 and
$92 million of minority interest expense for the six months ended june 30,
2000. the increase in both periods is primarily due to the consolidation of
excite@home effective september 1, 2000. the minority interest income in 2001
primarily reflects loss generated by excite@home, including business
restructuring and asset impairment charges, that were attributable to the
approximate 77% of excite@home not owned by at&amp;t.; the income tax benefit
recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $7 million and $31 million
for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. the income tax benefit
recorded on minority interest income (expense) was $87 million and $59 million

equity losses from liberty media group (lmg), which is recorded net of income
taxes, increased $2.4 billion for the three months and $4.0 billion for the six
months ended june 30, 2001 compared with the same periods in 2000. the higher
losses were primarily driven by higher losses of affiliates, lower gains on
dispositions and higher unrealized loss on financial instruments.

net losses from other equity investments, recorded net of income taxes, were
$0.3 billion in the second quarter of 2001, a 47.4% increase compared with the
prior year quarter. this increase was primarily due to the higher equity loss
from concert, partially offset by the consolidation of excite@home. the income
tax benefit recorded on net losses from other equity investments was $91 million
and $122 million for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. also
included in this line is amortization of goodwill associated with
nonconsolidated investments recorded as a reduction of income. this totaled $76
million and $110 million for the second quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

net losses from other equity investments were $0.3 billion for the six months
ended june 30, 2001, a decrease of $58 million, or 14.9%, compared with the same
period of 2000. this decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of
excite@home, the higher earnings related to cablevision systems corp. reflecting
a gain associated with the swap of cable properties. partially offsetting these
decreases was a higher equity loss from concert. the income tax benefit recorded
on net losses from other equity investments was $166 million and $267 million
for the first half of 2001 and the first half of 2000, respectively.
amortization of goodwill associated with nonconsolidated investments recorded as
a reduction of income. this totaled $156 million and $225 million for the first
six months of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

fair value adjustments of debt instruments including those acquired in
conjunction with the mediaone merger, as well as to our warrant portfolio due to
the adoption of sfas no. 133. in addition, we also reclassified certain
investment securities, which support debt that is indexed to those securities,
from "available-for-sale" to "trading."

cumulative effect of accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, was $0.5
billion, for liberty media group for the first half of 2001. this represents the

dividend requirements of preferred stock were $0.2 billion in the second quarter
of 2001 and $0.4 billion for the first half of 2001. the preferred

<page>   46
stock dividend represented interest in connection with convertible preferred
stock issued to ntt docomo in january of 2001 as well as accretion of the
beneficial conversion feature. on july 9, 2001, in conjunction with the
split-off of at&amp;t; wireless group, these preferred shares were converted into
at&amp;t; wireless common stock. as a result, we will recognize, in the third
quarter, the remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature balance of $0.2

segment results

in support of the services we provide, we segment our results by the business
units that support our primary lines of business: at&amp;t; business, at&amp;t; consumer
and at&amp;t; broadband. the balance of at&amp;t;'s continuing operations, excluding lmg
is included in a corporate and other category. although not a segment, we also
discuss the results of lmg.

the discussion of segment results includes revenue; ebit (earnings before
interest, taxes, the cumulative effect of an accounting change, dividend
requirements of preferred stock, the premium on the wireless exchange and
discontinued operations); ebitda (ebit excluding depreciation and amortization,
and minority interest (expense) income other than excite@home's minority
interest (expense) income); total assets, and capital additions. the discussion
of ebitda for at&amp;t; broadband is modified to exclude other income and net losses
from equity investments. total assets for each segment includes all assets,
except intercompany receivables. prepaid pension assets and corporate-owned or
leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level, and therefore are
included in the corporate and other group. capital additions for each segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, additions to
nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs and additions to
internal-use software.

ebit is the primary measure used by at&amp;t;'s chief operating decision makers to
measure at&amp;t;'s operating results and to measure segment profitability and
performance. at&amp;t; calculates ebit as operating (loss) income plus net pretax
losses from equity investments, pretax minority interest income (expense) and
other income. in addition, management also uses ebitda as a measure of segment
profitability and performance, and is defined as ebit, excluding minority
interest (expense) income other than excite@home's minority interest (expense)
income, plus depreciation and amortization. interest and taxes are not factored
into the segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision
makers; therefore, trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis.
management believes ebit and ebitda are meaningful to investors because they
provide analysis of operating results using the same measures used by at&amp;t;'s
chief operating decision makers. in addition, we believe that both ebit and
ebitda allow investors a mean to evaluate the financial results of each segment
in relation to total at&amp;t.; ebit for at&amp;t; was deficit of $260 million and earning
of $3,099 million, and ebitda was $2,162 million and $4,997 million for the
three months ended june 30, 2001 and 2000,
<page>   48
respectively. ebit was $199 million and $5,669 million, and ebitda was $5,052
million and $9,327 million for the first half of 2001 and 2000, respectively.
our calculation of ebit and ebitda may or may not be consistent with the
calculation of these measures by other public companies. ebit and ebitda should
not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap) measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash
flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity. in addition, ebitda does not take into account changes in certain
assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.

in connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late 2000,
our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes since the publication
of our 2000 annual results. the changes are as follows: at&amp;t; business was
expanded to include the results of international operations and ventures. in
addition, certain corporate costs that were previously recorded within the
corporate and other group have been allocated to the respective segments in an
effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect all direct
corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services. all prior period
results have been restated to reflect these changes.

reflecting the dynamics of our business, we continuously review our management
model and structure, which may result in additional adjustments to our operating
segments in the future. in addition, when we create tracking stock for other
units, we will begin allocating `pure' corporate overhead as appropriate. see
note (b) for further detail on our restructuring plan.

revenue

at&amp;t; business revenue decreased $0.1 billion, or 1.8%, in the second quarter of
2001, and declined $0.2 billion, or 1.5%, for the six months ended june 30,
2001, compared with the same periods in 2000. the decreases were primarily due
to a decline in long distance voice revenue of approximately $0.5 billion and
$1.0 billion in the second quarter of 2001 and the first half of 2001,
respectively. the decreases were partially offset by growth in data/ip of
approximately $0.3 billion and $0.7 billion for the second quarter of 2001 and
the first half of 2001, respectively.

long distance voice services revenue declined at a low-teens percentage rate in
the second quarter and the first half of 2001 due to a declining average price
per minute reflecting the competitive forces within the industry that are
expected to continue. partially offsetting this decline was a mid single-digit
percentage growth in minutes during these periods.

data services, which represent the transportation of data, rather than voice,
along our network, grew nearly 14% and nearly 17% in the second quarter and the
first half of 2001, respectively. growth was led by the strength of packet
services, which includes frame relay, ip and asynchronous transfer mode (atm)
services; and high-speed private line services.

at&amp;t; solutions outsourcing revenue grew at a low single digit percentage rate
and high single digit percentage rate for the three and six months ended june
30, 2001, respectively, primarily due to growth from new contract signings and
add-on business from existing clients. the second quarter growth was negatively
impacted by exiting certain unprofitable contracts. this will also have a
negative impact on full year 2001 growth rate.

local voice services revenue grew over 30% for the second quarter of 2001. the
prior year quarter included an unfavorable adjustment related to legal rulings
concerning compensation payable to other carriers for call completion;

<page>   50
excluding this adjustment local voice grew approximately 20%. local voice
services revenue grew over 20% for the year-to-date period. excluding the prior
period compensation adjustment, local voice grew approximately 15% for the same
period. at&amp;t; added approximately 180,000 and nearly 300,000 access lines for the
quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, bringing total access lines in
service as of june 30, 2001 to almost 2.6 million, an increase of 30.5% compared
with june 30, 2000. at&amp;t; served more than 6,000 buildings on-net at june 30,
2001, representing a 3.0% increase compared with june 30, 2000.

at&amp;t; business services internal revenue increased $63 million, or 36.8%, for the
second quarter of 2001 and increased $133 million, or 40.5%, for the
year-to-date period, compared with the same periods in 2000. the increase was
due to greater sales of business long distance services and local voice services
to other at&amp;t; units that resell such services to their external customers,
primarily at&amp;t; broadband and at&amp;t; wireless. the resell of such services to at&amp;t;
wireless will be reported as external revenue starting in the third quarter of
2001.

ebit/ebitda

ebit declined $0.2 billion, or 10.3%, in the second quarter of 2001 and
decreased $0.3 billion, or 10.7%, for the six months ended june 30, 2001,
compared with the same periods in 2000. ebitda declined $0.2 billion, or 7.5%,
and $0.3 billion, or 6.5%, respectively, in the second quarter and the first
half of 2001. these declines primarily reflect the impact of pricing pressure
within the long distance voice business as well as the shift from higher margin
long distance services to lower margin growth services. these declines also
reflect the impact of higher equity losses recorded for concert. partially
offsetting these declines was a gain of approximately $0.5 billion recorded on
the sale of our stake in japan telecom in the second quarter of 2001.
additionally, the year-to-date comparisons also reflect restructuring charges of
$0.4 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2000. for the remainder of 2001,
concert is expected to continue to generate operating losses. currently, concert
is considering restructuring its business in order to return to profitability.
these actions could result in significant restructuring charges. in addition,
at&amp;t; and bt have been discussing a variety of strategic alternatives to the
concert joint venture and their respective other businesses, including a
narrowing of concert's business scope and its possible termination as a joint
venture. there can be no assurances, however, that an agreement could be reached
with bt with regard to any alternatives. in addition, there is no assurance as
to whether these discussions will continue, whether they will lead to any
business combination, other transaction or change in the existing alliance,
whether any of the transactions under discussion, or other transactions, will be
completed, or the timing or terms of any possible transaction.

ebit and ebitda margins for the quarter were 20.1% and 34.7%, respectively, for
the quarter ended june 30, 2001 and 22.0% and 36.8%, respectively, for the
quarter ended june 30, 2000. ebit and ebitda margins were 17.1% and 31.5%,
respectively, and 18.9% and 33.2%, respectively, for the six months ended june
30, 2001 and 2000.


other items

capital additions decreased 2.7% in the second quarter of 2001 and 4.2% in the
first half of 2001, compared with the same prior year periods. the decrease was
primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures for network assets that support
long distance voice services.

total assets decreased $0.6 billion, or 1.4%, at june 30, 2001, compared with
december 31, 2000. the decrease was primarily driven by lower investment balance
reflecting higher equity losses from concert and the sale of japan telecom.

at&amp;t; consumer

including long distance, local toll (intrastate calls outside the immediate

revenue

at&amp;t; consumer revenue declined 23.7%, or $1.2 billion, in the second quarter of
2001 and declined 22.1%, or $2.2 billion, for the first six months of 2001
compared with the corresponding periods in 2000. the revenue decline in both
periods reflects the impacts of volume reductions, primarily in traditional
voice services due to the acceleration of wireless and e-mail substitution, as
well as the impacts of ongoing competition. long distance calling volumes
declined at a low-teen percentage rate in both the second quarter and the first
half of 2001. the revenue declines were further impacted by the continued
migration of customers to lower-priced products and optional calling plans. in
addition, the revenue decline reflects the elimination of per-line charges in
2000 of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion, for the three and six-month
periods ended june 30, 2001, respectively.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda declined 32.7% and 30.9%, respectively, in the second quarter of
2001 compared with the prior year quarter. ebit and ebitda declined 26.8% and
25.8%, respectively, for the first half of 2001 compared with the same period in
2000. the decline in both periods was primarily driven by the impact of the
revenue declines partially offset by cost-control initiatives. with wireless and
e-mail substitution continuing to increase and as the local exchange carriers
continue their entry into the consumer long distance business, ebit and ebitda
are likely to continue to decline.

ebit and ebitda margins were 32.1% and 33.4%, respectively, for the second
quarter of 2001 and were 36.4% and 36.9%, respectively, for the second quarter
of 2000. ebit and ebitda margins were 32.5% and 33.8%, respectively, and 34.7%
and 35.4%, respectively, for the six months ended june 30, 2001 and 2000. the
margin decline was also driven by the impact of revenue declines partially
offset by cost control initiatives.

other items
capital additions declined $9 million and $10 million, respectively, for the
three and six-month periods ending june 30, 2001 compared with the corresponding
periods in 2000.

total assets declined $0.5 billion in the second quarter to $2.7 billion at june
30, 2001. the decline was primarily driven by lower receivables, reflecting
lower revenue.

    *ebitda for at&amp;t; broadband excludes net losses from equity investments and
other income

the results of operations for the three and six months ended june 30, 2001
include a full period of mediaone operations, while the three and six months
ended june 30, 2000, include only two weeks of operations for mediaone.


revenue

broadband revenue grew $0.8 billion, or 49.5% for the three months ended june
30, 2001, and grew revenue $1.8 billion, or 53.7% for the six months ended june
30, 2001, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. approximately $0.7
billion of the increase in revenue for the three months ended june 30, 2001 was
due to the acquisition of mediaone. also contributing to the increase in revenue
was growth in broadband telephony service and high-speed data service of $0.1
billion. the revenue increase for the six months ended june 30, 2001 was
impacted by the acquisition of mediaone by $1.5 billion, as well as growth in
broadband telephony service and high-speed data service which accounted for
approximately $0.2 billion of the increase.

at june 30, 2001, broadband serviced approximately 14.4 million basic cable
customers, passing approximately 25.7 million homes, compared with 16.0 million
basic cable customers, passing approximately 27.9 million homes at june 30,
2000. at june 30, 2001, we provided digital video service to approximately 3.1
million customers, high-speed data service to approximately 1.3 million
customers and broadband telephony service to approximately 0.8 million
customers. this compares with 2.2 million digital-video customers, approximately
0.7 million high-speed data customers, and 0.2 million broadband telephony
customers at june 30, 2000.

ebit/ebitda

ebit for the second quarter of 2001 was a deficit of $0.8 billion, an increase
in deficit of $0.4 billion from a deficit of $0.4 billion for the comparable
prior year period. this increase was primarily due to $0.3 billion of net losses
on sales of businesses and investments, recorded in the second quarter of 2001,
primarily a loss on the redemption of at&amp;t; stock held by comcast in exchange for
an entity owning cable systems, offset by $0.1 billion gain on other cable
transactions in the quarter. also contributing to the increase was the impact of
the acquisition of mediaone, as well as increased restructuring and other
charges related to action taken in order to achieve synergies associated with
the mediaone acquisition of approximately $0.3 billion. these decreases were
offset by $0.1 billion of lower pretax losses from equity investments.

ebit for the six months ended june 30, 2001 was a deficit of $1.3 billion, an
increase in deficit of $1.2 billion from a deficit of $0.1 billion for the
comparable prior year period. this increase was primarily due to lower net
<page>   53
gains of $0.2 billion on sales of businesses and investments recorded in the
first half of 2001, which included a loss on the redemption of at&amp;t; stock held
by comcast in exchange for an entity owning cable systems and $0.1 billion gain
on other cable transactions. the first half of 2000 included $0.4 billion of
gains on sales of businesses and investments, primarily gains on the swap of
cable properties with cox as well as the sale of our investment in lenfest. also
contributing to the increased deficit was the impact of the acquisition of
mediaone, as well as higher restructuring and other charges related to action
taken in order to achieve synergies associated with the mediaone acquisition,
and increased expenses associated with high-speed data and broadband telephony
services of approximately $0.7 billion. these decreases were offset by $0.2
billion of lower pretax losses from equity investments.

ebitda, which excludes net losses from equity investments and other income, was
$0.5 billion for the three months ended june 30, 2001 an improvement of $0.1
billion, or 35.2% from the comparable prior year period. this improvement was
primarily due to the acquisition of mediaone offset by increased restructuring
and other charges, reflecting action taken in order to achieve synergies created
by the mediaone merger. ebitda, for the six months ended june 30, 2001 was $0.9
billion, an improvement of $0.2 billion, or 28.0%, from $0.7 billion in the
comparable prior year period. this improvement was primarily due to the
acquisition of mediaone, as well as higher revenue, offset by higher
restructuring and other charges and increased expenses associated with
high-speed data and telephony services.

other items

capital additions remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended june
30, 2001 compared with the corresponding prior year period and decreased
20.4% to $1.9 billion for the six months ended june 30, 2001 from $2.3 billion
for the comparable prior year period. this decrease was primarily driven by $0.5
billion decreased contributions to various nonconsolidated investments.

total assets at june 30, 2001, were $109.6 billion compared with $114.8 billion
at december 31, 2000. the decrease in total assets at june 30, 2001 is primarily
due to approximately $4.0 billion of cable system sales.

revenue

revenue for corporate and other for the second quarter of 2001 primarily
includes the elimination of intercompany revenue of negative $270 million ($97
million increase from prior year) and revenue from excite@home of $134 million
which was consolidated beginning september 1, 2000. revenue for corporate and
other for the first half of 2001 primarily includes the elimination of
intercompany revenue of negative $525 million ($194 million increase from prior
year) and revenue from excite@home of $278 million.

ebit/ebitda
ebit and ebitda declined $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, to
deficits of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, in the second quarter
of 2001 compared with the second quarter of 2000. the decline was primarily due
to a $1.1 billion investment impairment charge related to net2phone and a $0.8
billion loss on the excite@home put obligation settlement with cox and comcast.
also contributing to the decline was lower interest income of $0.1 billion and
costs associated with at&amp;t;'s corporate restructuring plan of $0.1 billion.

ebit and ebitda declined $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, to
deficits of $3.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, for the six months
ended june 30, 2001, compared with the same prior year period. the decline was
primarily due to a $1.1 billion investment impairment charge related to
net2phone and $0.9 billion in charges due to the adoption of sfas 133 as well as
the related ongoing investment and derivative revaluation. also contributing to
the decline was a $0.8 billion loss on the excite@home put obligation settlement
with cox and comcast, lower interest income of $0.1 billion and higher costs
associated with at&amp;t;'s corporate restructuring plan of $0.1 billion. these were
partially offset by lower net restructuring and other charges of $0.3 billion.

other items
capital additions increased $17 million, or 30.2%, in the second quarter of 2001
compared with the second quarter of 2000. the increase was primarily driven by
the consolidation of excite@home partially offset by lower funding to
nonconsolidated investments in 2001.

capital additions increased $0.2 billion, or 202.9%, for the first half of 2001
compared with the same period in 2000. the increase was driven by the
consolidation of excite@home and higher purchases of nonconsolidated
investments.

total assets increased $7.3 billion at june 30, 2001 to $19.4 billion. the
increase was primarily driven by higher cash balance held at june 30, 2001 which
reflected pre-funding of two july 2001 events, the maturity of one-year notes
and the repayment of an intercompany loan from at&amp;t; wireless, partially offset
by the write-down of our investment in net2phone for $1.1 billion and the
goodwill write-off of $0.9 billion for excite@home.

during the first half of 2001, net cash provided by operating activities
decreased $0.6 billion, compared with the prior year period. the decrease was
primarily driven by decreases in accounts payable, other assets and liabilities
and net income excluding the non-cash income items, partially offset by lower
receivables.

at&amp;t;'s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of $0.2 billion in the
first half of 2001, compared with $22.1 billion in the first half of 2000.
during the first half of 2001, at&amp;t; spent $4.7 billion on capital expenditures
and used approximately $0.2 billion toward other investments. in addition, at&amp;t;
received approximately $3.1 billion primarily for the net dispositions of cable
systems and approximately $1.6 billion primarily for the sale of investments.
during the first half of 2000, at&amp;t; spent approximately $16.0 billion to acquire
mediaone, $5.2 billion on capital expenditures, loaned $1.0 billion to concert
and infused $0.6 billion into existing cable investments. in addition, at&amp;t;
received approximately $0.5 billion primarily for the sale of investments.

during the first half of 2001, net cash provided by financing activities was
$0.5 billion, compared with $20.8 billion for the first half of 2000. during the
first half of 2001, at&amp;t; received $9.8 billion from the issuance of convertible
preferred stock to ntt docomo. at&amp;t; also made net payments of $9.1 billion to
reduce debt and paid dividends of $0.4 billion. during the first half of 2000,
at&amp;t; received $12.8 billion from the net issuance of debt and $10.3 billion from
the at&amp;t; wireless tracking stock offering. in addition, at&amp;t; paid dividends of
$1.5 billion, $0.5 billion for net acquisitions of treasury shares and redeemed
securities for $0.2 billion.

during the first half of 2001, net cash provided by discontinued operations was
$4.9 billion, compared with a net use of cash of $4.5 billion during the first
half of 2000. during the first half of 2001, at&amp;t; wireless issued $6.5 billion
of bonds that was partially offset by spending of $2.3 billion on capital
expenditures. during the first half of 2000, at&amp;t; wireless made net expenditures
of $2.6 billion to acquire businesses and spent $2.1 billion on capital
expenditures.

at june 30, 2001, we had current assets of $22.8 billion and current liabilities
of $35.3 billion. the current assets are primarily comprised of trade and other
receivables of $10.4 billion and cash of $9.7 billion. a significant portion of
the current liabilities, $22.9 billion, relates to short-term notes, the
majority of which were commercial paper or debt with an original maturity of one
year or less. in july 2001, $5.8 billion of the cash was used to settle an
intercompany loan from at&amp;t; wireless and the remainder was primarily used to
repay one-year notes that had matured.

we have used some of the proceeds received from the ntt docomo transaction and
closed sales of investments or assets to retire $8.5 billion of short-term debt
and $0.8 billion of long-term debt. we expect that we will retire a portion of
the remaining short-term debt with other financing arrangements, including the
monetization of publicly-held securities and sales of certain non-strategic
assets and investments. subsequent to june 30, 2001, we closed or announced the
sale of investments or assets, which will result in gross cash proceeds of
approximately $2.0 billion.

on february 28, 2001, we exercised our registration rights in twe and formally
requested twe to begin the process of converting the limited partnership into a
corporation with registered equity securities. on may 14, 2001, we named credit
suisse first boston as our investment banker for the registration process under
the twe partnership agreement. on august 9, 2001, we have reached an agreement
with cablevision systems corporation (cablevision) in which cablevision will
amend a pending registration statement to allow the sale of up to $1 billion of
the cablevision shares currently owned by at&amp;t.; cablevision has also agreed, at
at&amp;t;'s request, to file a registration statement for the sale of at&amp;t;'s
remaining cablevision shares in march 2002. in addition, cablevision, at at&amp;t;'s
request, will file a registration statement by october 1, 2001 for the sale of
rainbow media group tracking stock at&amp;t; holds.

in connection with the split-off of at&amp;t; wireless on july 9, 2001, we retained
approximately $3.0 billion in shares of at&amp;t; wireless services and immediately
exchanged $1.6 billion of those shares to retire debt. we expect to dispose of
the remaining $1.4 billion by the end of 2001.

since the announced restructuring plans to create four new businesses, at&amp;t;'s
debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. as a
result of this review, at&amp;t;'s ratings have been either downgraded and/or put on
credit watch with negative outlook. these actions have resulted in an increased
cost of borrowings and has limited our access to the capital markets.

at&amp;t; is pursuing various measures to reduce its debt level. however, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that are
acceptable to us. if these efforts cannot be completed successfully or on terms
and within the timeframe contemplated, at&amp;t;'s financial condition would be
materially adversely affected. some of these adverse conditions include the
company's ability to pursue acquisitions or make capital expenditures to expand
its network and cable plant, or pay dividends.

on december 28, 2000, we entered into a 364-day, $25 billion revolving-credit
facility syndicated to 39 banks which has subsequently been reduced as a result
of the ntt docomo investment, the at&amp;t; wireless bond offering, the sale of japan
telecom and the sale of various cable-systems. at&amp;t; currently has $14.7 billion
in bank credit facilities available to it.

also in connection with our restructuring plan, we reviewed our dividend policy
as it relates to each of the new businesses. on december 20, 2000, we announced
that the board of directors reduced at&amp;t;'s quarterly dividend to $0.0375 per
share, from $0.22 per share.

total assets decreased $3.4 billion, or 1.5%, to $230.9 billion at june 30, 2001
from $234.4 billion at december 31, 2000. the decrease was primarily due to
reduced net assets of discontinued operations of $4.9 billion. in addition, the
decrease was due to lower franchise costs as a result of net dispositions of
cable systems; the write down of our investment in net2phone as well as the sale
of other investments; and lower goodwill, primarily driven by the excite@home
impairment charge. partially offsetting these decreases was higher cash, which
reflected a pre-funding of the repayment of intercompany debt from at&amp;t; wireless
and other one-year notes maturing in july 2001.

total liabilities decreased $14.9 billion, or 12.2%, to $106.7 billion at june
30, 2001 from $121.6 billion at december 31, 2000. this decrease primarily
resulted from the payment of debt and accounts payable, as well as the
settlement with at&amp;t; common stock of the excite@home put obligation with cox and
comcast. partially offsetting this decrease was the establishment of a liability
payable to liberty media group resulting from at&amp;t;'s planned split-off of lmg.
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement dated march 9, 1999 between at&amp;t; and lmg,
in the event lmg is split-off, at&amp;t; would be required to reimburse lmg
approximately $0.8 billion for the value of certain tci pre-acquisition net
operating loss carryforwards.

minority interest decreased $0.9 billion, or 19.4%, to $3.9 billion at june 30,
2001 from $4.8 billion at december 31, 2000. this decrease reflects the loss of
excite@home, primarily driven by restructuring and asset impairment charges.

on january 22, 2001, ntt docomo invested approximately $9.8 billion for
812,511.778 shares of a new class of at&amp;t; preferred stock with a par value of $1
per share; and five-year warrants to purchase the equivalent of an additional
41.7 million shares of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at $35 per share. the
$9.8 billion of proceeds were recorded based on their relative fair values as
$9.2 billion for the preferred shares, $0.3 billion for the warrants in other
current liabilities and $0.2 billion for beneficial conversion feature. the
preferred shares were economically equivalent to 406 million shares (a 16
percent interest) of at&amp;t; wireless group tracking stock at june 30, 2001. the
convertible preferred stock balance at june 30, 2001 of $9.6 billion is
comprised of the $9.2 billion originally assigned to the shares plus $0.4
billion of accrued dividends and accretion of the beneficial conversion feature.

when at&amp;t; split-off at&amp;t; wireless on july 9, 2001, these preferred shares were
converted to at&amp;t; wireless common stock. upon conversion, at&amp;t; reduced its
portion of the financial performance and economic value in at&amp;t; wireless by 178
million shares, and the balance of the 406 million shares came from the issuance
of 228 million new shares of at&amp;t; wireless common stock.

total shareowners' equity increased $2.8 billion, or 2.7%, to $106.0 billion at
june 30, 2001 from $103.2 billion at december 31, 2000. this increase primarily
resulted from the issuance of stock to settle the excite@home put obligation
with cox and comcast, as well as the issuance of stock to acquire cable systems
from cablevision, partially offset by the redemption of at&amp;t; shares held by
comcast in exchange for certain cable systems and the capital contribution due
to lmg upon split-off for the value of certain tci pre-acquisition net operating
loss carryforwards.
<page>   59
in the second quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; increased treasury stock held by
approximately 436 million shares of which 372 million shares resulted from the
wireless tracking stock exchange offer and approximately 64 million from at&amp;t;
shares held by comcast that were redeemed in exchange for an entity owning
cable-systems.


risk management
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign exchange
rates. on a limited basis we use certain derivative financial instruments,
including interest rate swaps, options, forwards, equity hedges and other
derivative contracts to manage these risks. we do not use financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. all financial instruments are used in
accordance with board-approved policies.

assuming a 10% downward shift in interest rates at june 30, 2001, the fair value
of unhedged debt would have increased by approximately $1.4 billion.


new accounting pronouncements

in the second quarter of 2001, at&amp;t; adopted sfas no. 140, "accounting for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities -
a replacement of fasb statement no. 125." this statement provides accounting and
reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishment of liabilities. under these standards, after a transfer of
financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished.
this statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. this
statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march 31, 2001. the adoption had
no material impact on at&amp;t;'s results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

in july 2001, the financial accounting standard board(fasb) issued statement of
financial accounting standard (sfas) no. 141, "business combinations," which
supercedes accounting principles board (apb) opinion no. 16. sfas no. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 be accounted
for under the purchase method. in addition, sfas no. 141 establishes criteria
for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. at&amp;t; does not
expect that the adoption of sfas no. 141 will have a material effect on at&amp;t;'s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

also in july 2001, the fasb issued sfas no. 142, "goodwill and other intangible
assets," which supercedes apb opinion no. 17. under sfas no. 142 goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but rather will
be tested for impairment at least annually. in addition, the amortization period
of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to 40 years.
sfas no. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2001,
which for at&amp;t; means the standard will be adopted on january 1, 2002. in
connection with the adoption of this standard, at&amp;t;'s unamortized goodwill
balance will no longer be amortized, but will continue to be tested for
impairment. therefore, we expect that this standard will have a significant
impact on our results. we are assessing the impact of the standard on other
indefinite lived assets and the total impact of such standard on our results of
operations.

subsequent event

on august 10, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the split-off of liberty media corporation as
an independent, publicly-traded company. at&amp;t; redeemed each outstanding share of
class a and class b liberty media group (lmg) tracking stock for one share of
liberty media corporation's series a and series b common stock, respectively. as
the split-off was recorded as a book value transaction, therefore, no gain or
loss was recorded for the transaction.

on july 9, 2001, at&amp;t; completed the split-off of at&amp;t; wireless as a separate,
independently-traded company. all at&amp;t; wireless tracking stock was converted
into at&amp;t; wireless common stock on a one-for-one basis and 1,136 million shares
of at&amp;t; wireless common stock, held by at&amp;t;, was distributed to at&amp;t; common
shareowners on a basis of 0.3218 of a share of at&amp;t; wireless for each at&amp;t; share
outstanding. the split-off of at&amp;t; wireless will result in a non-cash gain of
approximately $13 billion, which represents the difference between the fair
value of the wireless tracking stock at the date of the split-off and at&amp;t;'s
book value in at&amp;t; wireless services. this gain will be recorded in the third
quarter of 2001 and be reflected as "gain on the disposition of discontinued
operations." in addition, at&amp;t; retained approximately $3 billion, or 7.3%, of
at&amp;t; wireless common stock, about half of which was used in a debt-for-equity
exchange in july which will result in a pretax gain of approximately $0.5
billion to be recorded in other income. the remaining shares will be sold,
exchanged or monetized within the next six months. in conjunction with the
split-off of at&amp;t; wireless group, ntt docomo converted their at&amp;t; convertible
preferred shares held into at&amp;t; wireless common stock. upon conversion, at&amp;t;
reduced its portion of the financial performance and economic value in the at&amp;t;
wireless group by 178 million shares, and the balance of the 406 million shares
came from the issuance of 228 million new shares of at&amp;t; wireless common stock.
