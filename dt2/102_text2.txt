item 7(a).  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk sensitive instruments and positions

the risk inherent in the company's market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. the
sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse
changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional
actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes. actual
results may differ. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for
accounting policies and additional information. in addition, the following
analyses exclude any impact of the proposed transactions discussed on page 23.

aircraft fuel the company's earnings are affected by changes in the price and
availability of aircraft fuel. in order to provide a measure of control over
price and supply, the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage
facilities to support its flight operations. the company also manages the price
risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing swap and option contracts. market risk is
estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the december 31, 2000 and
1999 cost per gallon of fuel. based on projected 2001 fuel usage, such an
increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately
$194 million in 2001, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december 31,
2000. comparatively, based on projected 2000 fuel usage, such an increase would
have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $131
million in 2000, net of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december 31, 1999.
the change in market risk is due primarily to the increase in fuel prices. as of
december 31, 2000, the company had hedged approximately 40 percent of its 2001
fuel requirements, approximately 15 percent of its 2002 fuel requirements, and
approximately seven percent of its 2003 fuel requirements, compared to
approximately 48 percent of its 2000 fuel requirements and 10 percent of its
2001 fuel requirements hedged at december 31, 1999.

foreign currency the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations on the u.s. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
revenues and expenses. the company's largest exposure comes from the canadian
dollar, british pound, japanese yen, euro and various latin and south american
currencies. the company uses options to hedge a portion of its anticipated
foreign currency-denominated ticket sales. the result of a uniform 10 percent
strengthening in the value of the u.s. dollar from december 31, 2000 and 1999
levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign
currency exposure would result in a decrease in operating income of
approximately $33 million and $39 million for the years ending december 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively, net of hedge instruments outstanding at december 31,
2000 and 1999, due to the company's foreign-denominated revenues exceeding its
foreign-denominated expenses. this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon
projected 2001 and 2000 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of
december 31, 2000 and 1999.

interest the company's earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates
due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash and
short-term investments, and its interest expense from variable-rate debt
instruments. the company has variable-rate debt instruments representing
approximately 29 percent and 21 percent of its total long-term debt,
respectively, at december 31, 2000 and 1999, and interest rate swaps on notional
amounts of approximately $158 million and $696 million, respectively, at
december 31, 2000 and 1999. during 2000, the company terminated interest rate
swap agreements on notional amounts of approximately $425 million. the cost of
terminating these interest rate swap agreements was not material. if interest
rates average 10 percent more in 2001 than they did at december 31, 2000, the
company's interest expense would increase by approximately $11 million and
interest income from cash and short-term investments would increase by
approximately $15 million. in comparison, at december 31, 1999, the company
estimated that if interest rates averaged 10 percent more in 2000 than they did
at december 31, 1999, the company's interest expense would have increased by
approximately $10 million and interest income from cash and short-term
investments would have increased by approximately $11 million. these amounts are
determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the
company's variable-rate long-term debt, interest rate swap agreements, and cash
and short-term investment balances at december 31, 2000 and 1999.


                                       27

       market risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential
increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in
interest rates, and amounts to approximately $148 million and $156 million as of
december 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the fair values of the company's
long-term debt were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future
cash flows based on the company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types
of borrowing arrangements.

investments the company is subject to market risk related to its ownership of
approximately 1.2 million depository certificates convertible, subject to
certain restrictions, into the common stock of equant, as of december 31, 2000
and 1999. the estimated fair value of these depository certificates was
approximately $32 million and $136 million as of december 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, based upon the market value of equant common stock.

       in addition, the company holds investments in certain other entities
which are subject to market risk. however, the impact of such market risk on
earnings is not significant due to the immateriality of the carrying value and
the geographically diverse nature of these holdings.

notes to consolidated financial statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.     summary of accounting policies

basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of amr corporation (amr or the company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
including its principal subsidiary american airlines, inc. (american). all
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. the results of
operations, cash flows and net assets for sabre holdings corporation (sabre),
amr services, amr combs and teleservice resources have been reflected in the
consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. unless
specifically indicated otherwise, the information in the footnotes relates to
the continuing operations of amr. all share and per share amounts reflect the
stock split on june 9, 1998, where appropriate. certain amounts from prior years
have been reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those
estimates.

inventories spare parts, materials and supplies relating to flight equipment are
carried at average acquisition cost and are expensed when incurred in
operations. allowances for obsolescence are provided, over the estimated useful
life of the related aircraft and engines, for spare parts expected to be on hand
at the date aircraft are retired from service, plus allowances for spare parts
currently identified as excess. these allowances are based on management
estimates, which are subject to change.

equipment and property the provision for depreciation of operating equipment and
property is computed on the straight-line method applied to each unit of
property, except that major rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are
depreciated on a group basis. the depreciable lives used for the principal
depreciable asset classifications are:

(1)   approximate final aircraft retirement date.

       residual values for aircraft, engines, major rotable parts, avionics and
assemblies are generally five to 10 percent, except when a guaranteed residual
value or other agreements exist to better estimate the residual value.

       effective january 1, 1999, in order to more accurately reflect the
expected useful life of its aircraft, the company changed its estimate of the
depreciable lives of certain aircraft types from 20 to 25 years and increased
the residual value from five to 10 percent. it also established a 30-year life
for its new boeing 777 aircraft, first delivered in the first quarter of 1999.
as a result of this change, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by
approximately $158 million and net earnings were increased by approximately $99
million, or $0.63 per common share diluted, for the year ended december 31,
1999.

1.     summary of accounting policies (continued)

       equipment and property under capital leases are amortized over the term
of the leases or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their expected useful
lives, and such amortization is included in depreciation and amortization. lease
terms vary but are generally 10 to 25 years for aircraft and seven to 40 years
for other leased equipment and property.

maintenance and repair costs maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased
flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except engine
overhaul costs incurred by amr eagle holding corporation (amr eagle) and costs
incurred for maintenance and repair under power by the hour maintenance contract
agreements, which are accrued on the basis of hours flown.

intangible assets route acquisition costs and airport operating and gate lease
rights represent the purchase price attributable to route authorities, airport
take-off and landing slots and airport gate leasehold rights acquired. these
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years for route
authorities, primarily 25 years for airport take-off and landing slots, and the
term of the lease for airport gate leasehold rights.

passenger revenues passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component
of air traffic liability. revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the
time service is provided. however, due to various factors, including the complex
pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry, certain
amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of
the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. actual
results could differ from those estimates.

advertising costs the company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
advertising expense was $221 million, $206 million and $196 million for the
years ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

frequent flyer program the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel
awards is accrued when such award levels are reached. american sells mileage
credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer
program. the portion of the revenue related to the sale of mileage credits is
deferred and recognized over a period approximating the period during which the
mileage credits are used. the remaining portion of the revenue is recognized
upon receipt as the related services have been provided.

statements of cash flows short-term investments, without regard to remaining
maturity at acquisition, are not considered as cash equivalents for purposes of
the statements of cash flows.

stock options the company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with accounting principles board opinion no. 25, "accounting for
stock issued to employees" (apb 25) and related interpretations. under apb 25,
no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the exercise
price of the company's stock option grants is at or above the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

       during 1999, the company entered into an agreement with priceline.com
incorporated (priceline) whereby ticket inventory provided by the company may be
sold through priceline's e-commerce system. in conjunction with this agreement,
the company received warrants to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of
priceline common stock. in the second quarter of 2000, the company sold these
warrants for proceeds of approximately $94 million, and recorded a gain of $57
million, which is included in miscellaneous - net on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

       at december 31, 1998, the company owned approximately 3.1 million
depository certificates convertible, subject to certain restrictions, into the
common stock of equant n.v. (equant), which completed an initial public offering
in july 1998. approximately 1.7 million of the certificates were held by the
company on behalf of sabre. during 1999, the company acquired approximately
400,000 equant depository certificates from other airlines. in addition, based
upon a reallocation between the owners of the certificates in july 1999, the
company received an additional 2.6 million certificates, of which approximately
2.2 million certificates were held for the benefit of sabre. in connection with
two secondary offerings by equant in february and december 1999, the company
sold approximately 2.7 million depository certificates for a net gain of
approximately $118 million, after taxes and minority interest. of this amount,
approximately $75 million is included in miscellaneous - net and approximately
$71 million, net of taxes and minority interest, related to depository
certificates held by the company on behalf of sabre, is included in income from
discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

       as of december 31, 2000 and 1999, the company holds approximately 1.2
million depository certificates with an estimated market value of approximately
$32 million and $136 million, respectively. the carrying value of the company's
investment in the depository certificates as of december 31, 2000 and 1999, was
approximately $20 million, and is included in other assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

2.     investments (continued)

       in december 1999, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
investment in the cumulative mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock
of canadian airlines international limited (canadian) for approximately $40
million, resulting in a gain of $40 million, which is included in miscellaneous
- - net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. in addition,
the company recognized a tax benefit of $67 million resulting from the tax loss
on the investment, representing the reversal of a deferred tax valuation
allowance since it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be
realized. the valuation allowance was established in 1996 when the investment
was written-off because, at that time, it was not more likely than not that the
tax benefit of the write-off would be realized. during 2000, the company
recorded a gain of approximately $41 million from the recovery of start-up
expenses (previously written-off) from the canadian services agreement entered
into during 1995, which is included in miscellaneous - net on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

3.     commitments and contingencies

       at december 31, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the
following aircraft: 66 boeing 737-800s, 23 boeing 757-200s, 20 boeing
777-200ers, 146 embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj-700s. deliveries of
all aircraft extend through 2006. future payments for all aircraft, including
the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $2.7 billion in
2001, $1.6 billion in 2002, $900 million in 2003 and an aggregate of
approximately $1.3 billion in 2004 through 2006. in addition to these
commitments for aircraft, the company's board of directors has authorized
expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion over the next five years for
modifications to aircraft, renovations of - and additions to - airport and
off-airport facilities, and the acquisition of various other equipment and
assets. amr expects to spend approximately $855 million of this authorized
amount in 2001.

       the miami international airport authority is currently remediating
various environmental conditions at the miami international airport (the
airport) and funding the remediation costs through landing fee revenues and
other cost recovery methods. future costs of the remediation effort may be borne
by carriers operating at the airport, including american, through increased
landing fees and/or other charges since certain of the potentially responsible
parties are no longer in business. the future increase in landing fees and/or
other charges may be material but cannot be reasonably estimated due to various
factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be
required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be recovered from the
responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding the environmental agencies that
will ultimately supervise the remedial activities and the nature of that
supervision. in addition, the company is subject to environmental issues at
various other airport and non-airport locations. management believes, after
considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these
environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. amounts
recorded for environmental issues are based on the company's current assessments
of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease as these
assessments change.

       the company has agreed to sell its mcdonnell douglas md-11 aircraft to
fedex corporation (fedex). no significant gain or loss is expected to be
recognized as a result of this transaction. as of december 31, 2000, the
carrying value of the remaining aircraft american has committed to sell was
approximately $462 million.

       amr and american have included event risk covenants in approximately $2.2
billion of indebtedness. these covenants permit the holders of such indebtedness
to receive a higher rate of return (between 75 and 650 basis points above the
stated rate) if a designated event, as defined, should occur and the credit
rating of such indebtedness is downgraded below certain levels within a certain
period of time following the event.

<page>   42

3.     commitments and contingencies (continued)

       special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain
municipalities, primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities
that are leased by american. in certain cases, the bond issue proceeds were
loaned to american and are included in long-term debt. certain bonds have rates
that are periodically reset and are remarketed by various agents. in certain
circumstances, american may be required to purchase up to $544 million of the
special facility revenue bonds prior to scheduled maturity, in which case
american has the right to resell the bonds or to use the bonds to offset its
lease or debt obligations. american may borrow the purchase price of these bonds
under standby letter of credit agreements. at american's option, certain letters
of credit are secured by funds held by bond trustees and by approximately $540
million of short-term investments.

4.     leases

       amr's subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property,
including aircraft, and airport and off-airport facilities. the future minimum
lease payments required under capital leases, together with the present value of

       at december 31, 2000, the company had 201 jet aircraft and 39 turboprop
aircraft under operating leases, and 65 jet aircraft and 57 turboprop aircraft
under capital leases. the aircraft leases can generally be renewed at rates
based on fair market value at the end of the lease term for one to five years.
most aircraft leases have purchase options at or near the end of the lease term
at fair market value, but generally not to exceed a stated percentage of the
defined lessor's cost of the aircraft or at a predetermined fixed amount.

       during 1996, american made prepayments on the cancelable operating leases
it had on 12 of its boeing 767-300 aircraft. upon the expiration of the amended
leases, american can purchase the aircraft for a nominal amount. as a result,
the aircraft were recorded as flight equipment under capital leases. during 2000
and 1999, the company exercised its option to purchase six and two of the boeing
767-300 aircraft for a nominal fee, respectively. as such, these aircraft were
reclassified from flight equipment under capital leases to owned flight
equipment.

       rent expense, excluding landing fees, was $1.3 billion for 2000 and 1999,
and $1.1 billion for 1998.

       maturities of long-term debt (including sinking fund requirements) for
the next five years are: 2001 - $569 million; 2002 - $201 million; 2003 - $169
million; 2004 - $228 million; 2005 - $482 million.

       during the third quarter of 2000, the company repurchased prior to
scheduled maturity approximately $167 million in face value of long-term debt.
cash from operations provided the funding for the repurchases. these
transactions resulted in an extraordinary loss of $14 million ($9 million
after-tax).

       american has $1.0 billion in credit facility agreements that expire
december 15, 2005, subject to certain conditions. at american's option, interest
on these agreements can be calculated on one of several different bases. for
most borrowings, american would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon
the london interbank offered rate (libor). at december 31, 2000, no borrowings
were outstanding under these agreements.

       certain debt is secured by aircraft, engines, equipment and other assets
having a net book value of approximately $3.4 billion. in addition, certain of
american's debt and credit facility agreements contain restrictive covenants,
including a minimum net worth requirement, which could limit american's ability
to pay dividends. at december 31, 2000, under the most restrictive provisions of
those debt and credit facility agreements, approximately $1.5 billion of the
retained earnings of american was available for payment of dividends to amr.

       cash payments for interest, net of capitalized interest, were $301
million, $237 million and $277 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

6.     financial instruments and risk management

       as part of the company's risk management program, amr uses a variety of
financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fuel swap and option
contracts, and currency exchange agreements. the company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

       notional amounts and credit exposures of derivatives

       the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments summarized in
the tables which follow do not represent amounts exchanged between the parties
and, therefore, are not a measure of the company's exposure resulting from its
use of derivatives. the amounts exchanged are calculated based on the notional
amounts and other terms of the instruments, which relate to interest rates,
exchange rates or other indices.

6.     financial instruments and risk management (continued)

       the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to these financial instruments, but it does not expect any of
the counterparties to fail to meet its obligations. the credit exposure related
to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts
with a positive fair value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of
master netting agreements. to manage credit risks, the company selects
counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
program and its relative market position with each counterparty. the company
also maintains industry-standard security agreements with the majority of its
counterparties which may require the company or the counterparty to post
collateral if the value of these instruments falls below certain mark-to-market
thresholds. as of december 31, 2000, no collateral was required under these
agreements, and the company does not expect to post collateral in the near
future.

       interest rate risk management

       american utilizes interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert a
portion of its fixed-rate obligations to floating-rate obligations. these
agreements involve the exchange of amounts based on a floating interest rate for
amounts based on fixed interest rates over the life of the agreement without an
exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based. the
differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and
recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the obligation. the
related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is included in
current liabilities or assets. the fair values of the swap agreements are not
recognized in the financial statements. gains and losses on terminations of
interest rate swap agreements are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying
amount of the outstanding obligation and amortized as an adjustment to interest
expense related to the obligation over the remaining term of the original
contract life of the terminated swap agreement. in the event of the early
extinguishment of a designated obligation, any realized or unrealized gain or
loss from the swap would be recognized in income coincident with the
extinguishment.

       during 2000, the company terminated interest rate swap agreements on
notional amounts of approximately $425 million which had effectively converted a
portion of its fixed-rate obligations to floating-rate obligations. the cost of
terminating these interest rate swap agreements was not material.

       the following table indicates the notional amounts and fair values of the
company's interest rate swap agreements (in millions):

       fuel price risk management

       american enters into fuel swap and option contracts to protect against
increases in jet fuel prices. under the fuel swap agreements, american receives
or makes payments based on the difference between a fixed price and a variable
price for certain fuel commodities. under the fuel option agreements, american
pays a premium to cap prices at a fixed level. the changes in market value of
such agreements have a high correlation to the price changes of the fuel being
hedged. effective gains or losses on fuel hedging agreements are recognized as a
component of fuel expense when the underlying fuel being hedged is used. any
premiums paid to enter into option contracts are recorded as assets. gains and
losses on fuel hedging agreements would be recognized immediately should the
changes in the market value of the agreements cease to have a high correlation
to the price changes of the fuel being hedged. at december 31, 2000, american
had fuel hedging agreements with broker-dealers on approximately 2.3 billion
gallons of fuel products, which represented approximately 40 percent of its
expected 2001 fuel needs, approximately 15 percent of its expected 2002 fuel
needs, and approximately seven percent of its expected 2003 fuel needs. the fair
value of the company's fuel hedging agreements at december 31, 2000,
representing the amount the company would receive to terminate the agreements,
totaled $223 million. at december 31, 1999, american had fuel hedging agreements
with broker-dealers on approximately 2.0 billion gallons of fuel products, which
represents approximately 48 percent of its expected 2000 fuel needs and
approximately 10 percent of its expected 2001 fuel needs. the fair value of the
company's fuel hedging agreements at december 31, 1999, representing the amount
the company would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled $232 million.

       foreign exchange risk management

       to hedge against the risk of future exchange rate fluctuations on a
portion of american's foreign cash flows, the company enters into various
currency put option agreements on a number of foreign currencies. the option
contracts are denominated in the same foreign currency in which the projected
foreign cash flows are expected to occur. these contracts are designated and
effective as hedges of probable quarterly foreign cash flows for various periods
through december 31, 2001, which otherwise would expose the company to foreign
currency risk. realized gains on the currency put option agreements are
recognized as a component of passenger revenues. at december 31, 2000 and 1999,
the notional amount related to these options totaled approximately $456 million
and $445 million, respectively, and the fair value, representing the amount amr
would receive to terminate the agreements, totaled approximately $20 million and
$14 million, respectively.

       the company has entered into japanese yen currency exchange agreements to
effectively convert certain yen-based lease obligations into dollar-based
obligations. changes in the value of the agreements due to exchange rate
fluctuations are offset by changes in the value of the yen-denominated lease
obligations translated at the current exchange rate. discounts or premiums are
accreted or amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the lives of the
underlying lease obligations. the related amounts due to or from counterparties
are included in other liabilities or other assets. the net fair values of the
company's yen currency exchange agreements, representing the amount the company
would pay or receive to terminate the agreements, were (in millions):

       financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting
standards no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities", as amended (sfas 133), was adopted by the company on january 1,
2001. sfas 133 requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value. derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through income. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the ineffective portion of a
derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
the adoption of sfas 133 did not have a material impact on the company's net
earnings. however, the company recorded a transition adjustment of approximately

       at december 31, 2000, amr had available for federal income tax purposes
approximately $184 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards which
are available for an indefinite period.

       cash payments for income taxes were $49 million, $71 million and $408
million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

8.     common and preferred stock

       on june 9, 1998, a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock
dividend was effective for shareholders of record on may 26, 1998. all prior
period share and earnings per share amounts reflect the stock split. the company
has 20 million shares of preferred stock (without par value) authorized at
december 31, 2000 and 1999.

9.     stock awards and options

       under the 1998 long term incentive plan, as amended, officers and key
employees of amr and its subsidiaries may be granted stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock purchase rights,
other stock-based awards and/or performance-related awards, including cash
bonuses. the total number of common shares authorized for distribution under the
1998 long term incentive plan is 23,700,000 shares. the 1998 long term incentive
plan, the successor to the 1988 long term incentive plan, which expired may 18,
1998, will terminate no later than may 21, 2008. options granted under the 1988
and 1998 long term incentive plans (collectively, the plans) are awarded with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on date of grant,
become exercisable in equal annual installments over five years following the
date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. stock appreciation
rights may be granted in tandem with options awarded.

       as a result of the sabre spin-off in march 2000, amr's stock price was
adjusted from $60 9/16 to $25 9/16 by the new york stock exchange. accordingly,
all outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards, including the
related exercise prices, were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the
stock options and awards. see note 12 for information regarding the sabre
spin-off.

       in 2000, 1999 and 1998, the total charge for stock compensation expense
included in wages, salaries and benefits expense was $52 million, $53 million
and $52 million, respectively. no compensation expense was recognized for stock
option grants under the plans since the exercise price was the fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

       the weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share awards
granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $32.93, $62.95 and $62.06, respectively.

       the company has adopted the pro forma disclosure features of statement of
financial accounting standards no. 123, "accounting for stock-based
compensation" (sfas 123). as required by sfas 123, pro forma information
regarding income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss and
earnings per share from continuing operations before extraordinary loss has been
determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options and
awards granted subsequent to december 31, 1994 using the fair value method
prescribed by sfas 123. the fair value for the stock options was estimated at
the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998: risk-free interest rates
ranging from 5.01% to 6.15%; dividend yields of 0%; expected stock volatility
ranging from 29.9% to 43.5%; and expected life of the options of 4.5 years for
the plans and 1.5 years for the pilot plan.

       the black-scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. in addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. because the company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. in addition,
because sfas 123 is applicable only to options and stock-based awards granted
subsequent to december 31, 1994, its pro forma effect is not fully reflected in
years prior to 1999.

10.    retirement benefits

       all regular employees of the company are eligible to participate in
pension plans. the defined benefit plans provide benefits for participating
employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified
period of time before retirement. airline pilots and flight engineers also
participate in defined contribution plans for which company contributions are
determined as a percentage of participant compensation.

       in addition to pension benefits, other postretirement benefits, including
certain health care and life insurance benefits, are also provided to retired
employees. the amount of health care benefits is limited to lifetime maximums as
outlined in the plan. substantially all employees of american and employees of
certain other subsidiaries may become eligible for these benefits if they
satisfy eligibility requirements during their working lives.

       certain employee groups make contributions toward funding a portion of
their retiree health care benefits during their working lives. amr funds
benefits as incurred and makes contributions to match employee prefunding.

12.      discontinued operations

       during the first quarter of 1999, the company sold amr services, amr
combs and teleservice resources. as a result of these sales, the company
recorded a gain of approximately $64 million, net of income taxes of
approximately $19 million.

       on february 7, 2000, the company declared its intent to distribute amr's
entire ownership interest in sabre as a dividend on all outstanding shares of
its common stock. to effect the dividend, amr exchanged all of its 107,374,000
shares of sabre's class b common stock for an equal number of shares of sabre's
class a common stock. effective after the close of business on march 15, 2000,
amr distributed 0.722652 shares of sabre class a common stock for each share of
amr stock owned by amr's shareholders. the record date for the dividend of sabre
stock was the close of business on march 1, 2000. in addition, on february 18,
2000, sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of $675 million to
shareholders of record of sabre common stock at the close of business on
february 15, 2000. based upon its approximate 83 percent interest in sabre, amr
received approximately $559 million of this dividend. the dividend of amr's
entire ownership interest in sabre's common stock resulted in a reduction to
amr's retained earnings in march of 2000 equal to the carrying value of the
company's investment in sabre on march 15, 2000, which approximated $581
million. the fair market value of amr's investment in sabre on march 15, 2000,
based upon the quoted market closing price of sabre class a common stock on the
new york stock exchange, was approximately $5.2 billion. in addition, effective
march 15, 2000, the company reduced the exercise price and increased the number
of employee stock options and awards by approximately 19 million to offset the
dilution to the holders, which occurred as a result of the spin-off. these
changes were made to

13.    segment reporting

       statement of financial accounting standards no. 131, "disclosures about
segments of an enterprise and related information", as amended (sfas 131),
requires that a public company report annual and interim financial and
descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. operating
segments, as defined, are components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance.

       the company has two primary operating segments, consisting primarily of
american and amr eagle, which represent one reportable segment. american is one
of the largest scheduled passenger airlines in the world. at the end of 2000,
american provided scheduled jet service to more than 169 destinations throughout
north america, the caribbean, latin america, europe and the pacific. american is
also one of the largest scheduled air freight carriers in the world, providing a
full range of freight and mail services to shippers throughout its system. amr
eagle owns two regional airlines which do business as "american eagle" --
american eagle airlines, inc. and executive airlines, inc. the american eagle
carriers provide connecting service from eight of american's high-traffic cities
to smaller markets throughout the united states, canada, the bahamas and the
caribbean.

services. the difference between the financial information of the company's one

15.    subsequent events

       on january 10, 2001, the company announced three transactions that are
expected to substantially increase the scope of its existing network. first, the
company announced that it had agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets
of trans world airlines, inc. (twa) for approximately $500 million in cash and
to assume approximately $3.5 billion of twa's obligations. the company's
agreement with twa contemplated that twa would file for bankruptcy protection
under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code and conduct an auction of its
assets under the auspices of the bankruptcy court. during the auction, other
credible offers would compete with the company's offer. twa filed for bankruptcy
protection on january 10, 2001. in conjunction therewith, the company also
agreed to provide twa with up to $200 million in debtor-in-possession financing
to facilitate twa's ability to maintain its operations until the completion of
this transaction. the amount available under this facility was later increased
to $330 million. as of march 19, 2001, approximately $289 million had been
provided via the debtor-in-possession financing.

       the auction of twa's assets was commenced on march 5, 2001, and recessed
to march 7, 2001. during the recess, the company increased its cash bid to $625
million and agreed to leave in the twa estate certain aircraft security
deposits, advance rental payments and rental rebates that were estimated to
bring approximately $117 million of value to twa. on march 7, 2001, twa's board
selected the company's bid as the "highest and best" offer, and on march 12,
2001, the u.s. bankruptcy court, district of delaware, entered an order
approving the sale of twa's assets to the company. consummation of the
transaction is subject to several contingencies, including the waiver by twa's
unions of certain provisions of their collective bargaining agreements. the
approval of the u.s. department of justice was obtained on march 16, 2001.
certain parties have filed appeals of the bankruptcy court's sale order, and
have sought a stay of the transaction, pending the appeals. a provision of the
bankruptcy code will permit the company to close the transaction, despite
pending appeals, unless a stay is granted. if a stay is granted, the company
would anticipate that the appeal process would be expedited. upon the closing of
the transaction, twa will be integrated into american's operations with a
continued hub operation in st. louis.

       secondly, the company announced that it has agreed to acquire from united
airlines, inc. (united) certain key strategic assets (slots, gates and aircraft)
of us airways, inc. (us airways) upon the consummation of the previously
announced merger between united and us airways. in addition to the acquisition
of these assets, american will lease a number of slots and gates from united so
that american may operate half of the northeast shuttle (new york/washington
dc/boston). united will operate the other half of the shuttle. for these assets,
american will pay approximately $1.2 billion in cash to united and assume
approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. the consummation of
these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed united/us
airways merger. also, the acquisition of aircraft is generally dependent upon a
certain number of us airways' boeing 757 cockpit crew members transferring to
american's payroll.

       finally, american has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to
enter into an exclusive marketing agreement with, dc air llc (dc air). american
has agreed to pay $82 million in cash for its ownership stake. american will
have a right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent
stake in dc air. american will also lease to dc air a certain number of fokker
100 aircraft with necessary crews (known in the industry as a "wet lease").
these wet leased aircraft will be used by dc air in its operations. dc air is
the first significant new entrant at ronald reagan washington national airport
(dca) in over a decade. dc air will acquire the assets needed to begin its dca
operations from united/us airways upon the consummation of the merger between
the two carriers. american's investment in dc air and the other arrangements
described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between
united and us airways.

       as a result of the above transactions, and for several other reasons,
american and american eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet
types in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 121,
"accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of." this review could result in an impairment charge to be taken by
the company in 2001. the size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently
known, but may be significant.
