the company or with the counterparty by the company is based on fuel price in relation to the market values of the derivative contracts and collateral provisions per the terms of those contracts and can fluctuate significantly.  the company had surplus collateral posted with a certain counterparty as of september 30, 2009 due to a timing lag in collateral reconciliation.  the company is currently required to collateralize approximately 100 percent of the outstanding liability hedge contracts.  as
such, when these contracts settle, the collateral posted with counterparties will effectively offset the loss position and minimal further cash impact will be recorded assuming a static forward heating oil curve from september 30, 2009.  under the same assumption, the company does not currently expect to be required to deposit significant additional cash collateral above september 30, 2009 levels with counterparties with regard to fuel hedges in place as of september 30, 2009.  additional
information regarding the company’s fuel hedging program is also included in item 3 “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</font><font style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline">quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk</font><font style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline">item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk</font>
