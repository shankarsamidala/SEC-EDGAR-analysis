statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the company’s
actual results to differ materially from the company’s
expectations.  the following factors, in addition to other possible
factors not listed, could cause the company’s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:  the
materially weakened financial condition of the company, resulting from its
significant losses in recent years; the ability of the company to generate
additional revenues and reduce its costs; changes in economic and other
conditions beyond the company’s control, and the volatile results of the
company’s operations; the company’s substantial indebtedness and other
obligations; the ability of the company to satisfy existing financial or other
covenants in certain of its credit agreements; continued high and volatile fuel
prices and further increases in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel;
the fiercely and increasingly competitive business environment faced by the
company; industry consolidation; competition with reorganized carriers; low fare
levels by historical standards and the company’s reduced pricing power; the
company’s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on
acceptable terms; changes in the company’s corporate or business strategy;
government regulation of the company’s business; conflicts overseas or terrorist
attacks; uncertainties with respect to the company’s international operations;
outbreaks of a disease (such as sars or avian flu) that affects travel behavior;
labor costs that are higher than those of the company’s competitors;
uncertainties with respect to the company’s relationships with unionized and
other employee work groups; increased insurance costs and potential reductions
of available insurance coverage; the company’s ability to retain key management
personnel; potential failures or disruptions of the company’s computer,
communications or other technology systems; changes in the price of the
company’s common stock; and the ability of the company to reach acceptable
agreements with third parties.  additional information concerning
these and other factors is contained in the company’s securities and exchange
commission filings, including but not limited to the company’s 2007 form 10-k
(see in particular item 1a “risk factors” in the 2007 form 10-k, and as amended
in item 1a in this quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september
30, 2008).</font><font style="display: inline; font-size: 10pt; font-family: times new roman">the
company’s ability to become consistently profitable and its ability to continue
to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors,
many of which are largely beyond the company’s control.  certain risk
factors that affect the company’s business and financial results are referred to
under “forward-looking information” above and are discussed in the risk factors
listed in item 1a (on pages 11-17) in the 2007 form 10-k, and as amended in item
1a in this quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30,
2008. in addition, four of the company’s largest domestic competitors and
several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in the last several years and
have used this process to significantly reduce contractual labor and other
costs.  in order to remain competitive and to improve its financial
condition, the company must continue to take steps to generate additional
revenues and to reduce its costs. although the company has a number of
initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, the adequacy
and ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot
be assured.  it will be very difficult for the company to continue to
fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the
overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially and if fuel
prices were to persist for an extended period at recent historic high
levels.</font>
