                              PART III - NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, 11-K, 10-Q,
N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within
the prescribed time period. (Attach Extra Sheets if Needed)

The preparation of the financial statements of AMERCO and Consolidated
Subidiaries (the "Registrant") will not be completed by June 29, 2001 the last
day for a timely filing of its Annual Report of form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2001 pursuant to Rule O-2 of the General Rules and Regulations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The delay is due to management and the accountants requiring
additional time to internally verify data from the company's books and
records and from third parties for financial statements.
