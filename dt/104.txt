  of  the  information  and footnotes required by  generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for complete financial  statements.   In  the
  opinion  of  management,  these  financial  statements  contain  all
  adjustments,  consisting of both normal recurring accruals  and  the
  asset  impairment charge as discussed in footnote  8,  necessary  to
  present  fairly  the financial position, results of  operations  and
  cash  flows  for the periods indicated.  The results  of  operations
  and  cash  flows  for Sabre Holdings Corporation (Sabre)  have  been
  reflected  as discontinued operations in the consolidated  financial
  statements  for  the  six months ended June 30,  2000.   Results  of
  operations  for  the  periods presented herein are  not  necessarily
  indicative  of  results  of operations for  the  entire  year.   For
  further  information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
  and  footnotes thereto included in the AMR Corporation (AMR  or  the
  Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December  31,
  2000.   Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform  with  the
  2001 presentation.

2.Accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and  property  at  June
  30,  2001  and December 31, 2000, was $8.8 billion and $8.3 billion,
  respectively.   Accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital  leases at June 30, 2001 and December 31,  2000,  was
  $1.2 billion.

3.As  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial  statements
  included  in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for  the  year
  ended  December 31, 2000, the Miami International Airport  Authority
  is  currently  investigating and remediating  various  environmental
  conditions  at  the  Miami International Airport (the  Airport)  and
  funding   the  remediation  costs  through  various  cost   recovery
  methods.   American  Airlines, Inc. (American) and  AMR  Eagle  have
  been   named   as   potentially  responsible  parties   (PRPs)   and
  contributors  to  the contamination.  During the second  quarter  of
  2001,  the  Airport filed a lawsuit against 17 defendants, including
  American,  in  an  attempt to recover its past  and  future  cleanup
  costs  (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services, Inc.,
  et  al.  in  the  Florida Circuit Court).  In  addition  to  the  17
  defendants  named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies  and  companies
  were  also  named  as  PRPs and contributors to  the  contamination.
  American  and  AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup  costs  cannot  be
  reasonably  estimated due to various factors, including the  unknown
  extent  of the remedial actions that may be required, the proportion
  of  the  cost that will ultimately be recovered from the responsible
  parties,  and  uncertainties  regarding the  environmental  agencies
  that  will  ultimately  supervise the remedial  activities  and  the
  nature of that supervision. In  addition, the Company is subject to
  environmental issues at  various  other  airport  and  non-airport
  locations. Management believes, after considering a number of factors,
  that the ultimate disposition of these environmental issues is not
  expected to materially affect the Company's consolidated financial
  position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts recorded for
  environmental issues are based on the Company's current assessments
  of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease
  as these assessments change.

4.As  of June 30, 2001, the Company had commitments to acquire the
  following aircraft: 55 Boeing 737-800s, 19 Boeing 757-200s, 15 Boeing
  767-300ERs, 12 Boeing 777-200ERs, 139 Embraer regional jets  and  25
  Bombardier  CRJ-700s.  Deliveries of all aircraft  continue  through
  2006.  Payments for all aircraft will approximate $1.5 billion during
  the remainder of 2001, $2.2 billion in 2002, $1.5 billion in 2003 and
  an aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion in 2004 through 2006.

5.During  2001,  American  and  AMR Eagle entered  into  various  debt
  agreements which are secured by aircraft.  Effective interest  rates
  on  these  agreements are fixed or variable (based on LIBOR  plus  a
  spread)  and mature over various periods of time, ranging from  2013
  to   2021.    As  of  June  30,  2001,  the  Company  had   borrowed
  approximately $1.6 billion under these agreements.

6.In  April 2001, the Board of Directors of American approved  the
  guarantee by American of AMR's existing debt obligations.  As such, as
  of June 30, 2001, American will unconditionally guarantee through the
  life  of  the  related  obligations approximately  $700  million  of
  unsecured  debt,  approximately $700 million  of  secured  debt  and
  approximately $1.6 billion of special facility revenue bonds issued by
  municipalities.

7.On April 9, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the
  assets  of  Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) for approximately  $742
  million in cash (subject to certain working capital adjustments) and
  assumed  certain liabilities, including TWA's postretirement benefit
  other  than pension liability.  The $742 million includes  the  $625
  million  purchase  price paid to TWA and various  other  acquisition
  costs,  primarily  the  purchase of aircraft security  deposits  and
  prepaid rent.  TWA was the eighth largest U.S. carrier, with a primary
  domestic  hub  in St. Louis.  The Company funded the acquisition  of
  TWA's assets with its existing cash and short-term investments.  The
  acquisition  of TWA was accounted for under the purchase  method  of
  accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of TWA since  the
  date   of   acquisition  have  been  included  in  the  accompanying
  consolidated financial statements for the three and six-month periods
  ended June 30, 2001.

  The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  the
  preliminary  allocation of the purchase price, which  was  based  on
  estimated  fair  values  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities
  assumed,  and is subject to adjustments when additional  information
  concerning  asset  and  liability  valuations  are  finalized.   The
  preliminary excess purchase price over the estimated fair values  of
  the  net  assets  acquired resulted in goodwill in  excess  of  $800
  million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis  over  40
  years.   However,  effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  will
  discontinue   the  amortization  of  goodwill  in  accordance   with
  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill  and
  Other Intangible Assets."

  The  following  table  provides  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated
  results of operations, assuming the acquisition had occurred  as  of
  January 1, 2000 (in millions, except per share amounts):

8.In  conjunction  with  the  acquisition  of  TWA  and  the  proposed
  transactions announced on January 10, 2001, coupled with a  revision
  to  the  Company's fleet plan to accelerate the retirement dates  of
  its   Fokker  100,  Saab  340  and  ATR  42  aircraft,  the  Company
  determined  that  the  estimated  future  undiscounted  cash   flows
  expected  to  be generated by its Fokker 100, Saab 340  and  ATR  42
  aircraft  fleets  would  be  less than  their  carrying  amount  and
  therefore,   these  aircraft  were  impaired  under   Statement   of
  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121,  "Accounting   for   the
  Impairment  of  Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets  to  Be
  Disposed Of" (SFAS 121).  As a result, during the second quarter  of
  2001,   the   Company  recorded  an  asset  impairment   charge   of
  approximately $685 million ($430 million after-tax) relating to  the
  write-down of the carrying value of 71 Fokker 100 aircraft, 74  Saab
  340  aircraft and 20 ATR 42 aircraft and related rotables  to  their
  estimated   fair   market   values.    Management   estimated    the
  undiscounted future cash flows utilizing models used by the  Company
  in   making  fleet  and  scheduling  decisions.   In  addition,   in
  determining  the  fair market value of these aircraft,  the  Company
  considered  outside  third party appraisals and recent  transactions
  involving  sales of similar aircraft.  As a result of the  writedown
  of  these aircraft to fair market value, as well as the acceleration
  of   their   retirement  dates  and  changes  in   salvage   values,
  depreciation   and   amortization   expense   will    decrease    by
  approximately $18 million on an annualized basis.

10.During  the  second quarter of 2001, the Company  changed  the
  manner  in  which  it measured ineffectiveness for its  fuel  option
  contracts.  Effective June 1, 2001, the measurement is based on  the
  change  in  the total value of the option relative to the change  in
  the  value of the fuel being hedged.  In conjunction therewith,  the
  Company  reclassified the ineffective component of  its  fuel  hedge
  agreements  from  other  income (expense) to  fuel  expense  on  the
  accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

  For  the  three  and  six months ended June 30,  2001,  the  Company
  recognized  net gains of approximately $12 million and $37  million,
  respectively,  as  a component of fuel expense on  the  accompanying
  consolidated  statements of operations related to its  fuel  hedging
  agreements.   This compares to net gains recognized by  the  Company
  of  approximately  $110 million and $232 million, respectively,  for
  the  three  and  six months ended June 30, 2000.  (The  amounts  for
  2001  and  2000 are not comparable in that the 2001 amounts  reflect
  the  January  1, 2001 adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting
  Standards  No. 133 (SFAS 133); the 2000 amounts do not.)   The  fair
  value  of  the Company's fuel hedging agreements at June  30,  2001,
  representing  the amount the Company would receive to terminate  the
  agreements, totaled $203 million.

11.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
  sale securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
  the  fair  value  of certain derivative financial instruments  which
  qualify for hedge accounting in comprehensive income (loss).  For the
  three and six months ended June 30, 2001, comprehensive loss was $511
  million and $480 million, respectively.  The difference between  net
  loss and comprehensive loss for the six months ended June 30, 2001 is
  due primarily to the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 133 and
  the   on-going  fair  value  adjustments  of  derivative   financial
  instruments under SFAS 133, net of the reclassification into earnings
  of the Company's derivative financial instruments.

  As  of  June 30, 2001, the Company estimates during the next  twelve
  months  it  will  reclassify  from accumulated  other  comprehensive
  income  into earnings approximately $60 million (net of tax  of  $35
  million) relating to its derivative financial instruments.

12.During  1999,  the  Company entered into  an  agreement  with
  priceline.com  Incorporated  (priceline)  whereby  ticket  inventory
  provided  by the Company may be sold through priceline's  e-commerce
  system.   In  conjunction with this agreement, the Company  received
  warrants  to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of  priceline
  common  stock.   In  the second quarter of 2000,  the  Company  sold
  these  warrants  for  proceeds  of approximately  $94  million,  and
  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain of $57 million ($36  million  after-tax),
  which  is  included  in  Miscellaneous -  net  on  the  consolidated
  statements of operations.

13.Effective  after the close of business on March  15,  2000,  AMR
  distributed 0.722652 shares of Sabre Class A common stock  for  each
  share of AMR stock owned by AMR's shareholders.  The record date for
  the  dividend of Sabre stock was the close of business on  March  1,
  2000.  In addition, on February 18, 2000, Sabre paid a special  one-
  time cash dividend of $675 million to shareholders of record of Sabre
  common  stock at the close of business on February 15, 2000.   Based
  upon  its  approximate 83 percent interest in  Sabre,  AMR  received
  approximately $559 million of this dividend.  The dividend of  AMR's
  entire  ownership  interest in Sabre's common stock  resulted  in  a
  reduction to AMR's retained earnings in March of 2000 equal  to  the
  carrying value of the Company's investment in Sabre on March 15, 2000,
  which approximated $581 million.

  The  results  of  operations for Sabre have been  reflected  in  the
  consolidated  statements  of operations as discontinued  operations.
  Other  summarized  financial information of discontinued  operations
  for the six months ended June 30, 2000 is as follows (in millions):

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2001 and 2000

Summary  AMR's  net  loss for the three months ended  2001  was  $507
million, or $3.29 loss per share, as compared to net earnings of $321
million,  or  $1.96 per share diluted, for the same period  in  2000.
AMR's operating loss for the second quarter of 2001 was $760 million,
compared  to operating income of $517 million for the second  quarter
of  2000.   As  discussed in footnote 7 to the condensed consolidated
financial  statements,  on  April  9,  2001,  the  Company  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and assumed certain  liabilities  of
Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).  Accordingly, the operating results
of  TWA  since  the  date of acquisition have been  included  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements for the  three  month
period  ended June 30, 2001.  In addition, AMR's second quarter  2001
results  include: (i) a $430 million after-tax charge, or  $2.79  per
share, related to the writedown of the carrying value of its Fokker 100,
Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables in accordance  with
SFAS 121,"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived  Assets  to  be Disposed Of" (see footnote 8 to  the  condensed
consolidated financial statements), and (ii) a $29 million  after-tax
gain,  or  $0.19  per share, from the settlement of  a  legal  matter
related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.  AMR's second quarter
2000  results include an approximate $36 million after-tax  gain,  or
$0.21  per  share  diluted,  related to the  sale  of  the  Company's
warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com Incorporated
(priceline) common stock.

The  Company's revenues increased $572 million, or 11.4  percent,  in
the  second  quarter  of  2001  versus the  same  period  last  year.
However,  excluding  TWA's revenues for the  period  April  10,  2001
through June 30, 2001, the Company's revenues would have decreased by
approximately $173 million versus the same period last year.   During
the second quarter of 2001, the Company's results were impacted by  a
slowing  U.S. economy, dampening the demand for business travel  both
domestically  and  internationally, and  an  increase  in  fare  sale
activity compared to the same period in 2000.

American's  passenger  revenues decreased by  5.2  percent,  or  $217
million.  American's yield (the average amount one passenger pays  to
fly one mile) of 13.47 cents decreased by 2.1 percent compared to the
same period in 2000.  Domestic yields decreased 2.3 percent from  the
second  quarter of 2000.  International yields decreased 1.4 percent,
primarily  due  to  a  decrease of 12.3 percent and  3.3  percent  in
Pacific  and  European yields, respectively, partially offset  by  an
increase of approximately 3.4 percent in Latin American yields.

American's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (RPMs)  decreased  3.1
percent  to 29.5 billion miles for the quarter ended June  30,  2001.
American's  capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) of  41.0  billion
miles  increased 2.3 percent compared to the second quarter of  2000.
As  a result, American's load factor dropped 4 points year-over-year.
American's  domestic  traffic decreased 4.7  percent  on  a  capacity
increase  of  2.1 percent while international traffic  increased  0.2
percent  on  a  capacity  increase  of  2.7  percent.   International
activity  included a 17.2 percent increase in traffic to the  Pacific
on  a  capacity increase of 18.5 percent, a 1.7 percent  decrease  in
traffic  to Europe on a capacity increase of 5.2 percent, and  a  1.7
percent  decrease in traffic to Latin America on a capacity  decrease
of  2.5  percent.  The overall increase in capacity was due primarily
to  an  increase in the number of aircraft, partially offset  by  the
Company's More Room Throughout Coach program.

TWA's  passenger revenues were $671 million for the period April  10,
2001 through June 31, 2001.  TWA's traffic was 5.7 billion RPMs while
capacity was 8.0 billion ASMs.

AMR  Eagle's  passenger  revenues  increased  11.1  percent,  or  $41
million.   The  increase in passenger revenues resulted  from  a  3.5
percent  increase  in passenger yield and a 7.2 percent  increase  in
traffic,  due  to the continued addition of regional jets  and  steps
taken to improve the carrier's network.

Other  revenues increased $67 million, or 24.6 percent, due primarily
to the addition of TWA.

                                        -9-
<Page> 12
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The   Company's  operating  expenses  increased  41.1   percent,   or
approximately $1.9 billion, and included approximately  $757  million
related  to  TWA's operations for the period April 10,  2001  through
June  30,  2001.   American's cost per ASM increased 6.4  percent  to
10.98  cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter  2001  asset
impairment  charge.   The increase in American's  cost  per  ASM  was
driven  partially  by a reduction in ASMs due to the  Company's  More
Room Throughout Coach program.  Adjusted for this program, American's
cost  per  ASM  grew approximately 2.9 percent, excluding  the  asset
impairment  charge.   Wages,  salaries and  benefits  increased  27.0
percent,  or  $452 million, and included approximately  $286  million
related   to  the  addition  of  TWA.   The  remaining  increase   of
approximately  $166 million related primarily to an increase  in  the
average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate  and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  Company's   labor
contracts.   During the second quarter of 2001, the Company  recorded
approximately $170 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits
related to the Company's tentative labor contracts.  This was  mostly
offset by a $144 million decrease in the provision for profit-sharing
as  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.  Aircraft
fuel  expense  increased 48.5 percent, or $275 million, and  included
approximately  $121  million related to the  addition  of  TWA.   The
increase  in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 22.3 percent increase
in the Company's average price per gallon and a 21.2 percent increase
in  the Company's fuel consumption, including TWA.  Depreciation  and
amortization  expense increased 19.7 percent,  or  $58  million,  due
primarily  to  the  addition  of new  aircraft  and  an  increase  of
approximately $25 million related to TWA.  Other rentals and  landing
fees  increased  $64  million, or 25 percent, primarily  due  to  the
addition of TWA.  Commissions to agents decreased 4.8 percent, or $13
million,  and  included  approximately $31 million  related  to  TWA.
Despite  an  increase  of  approximately  10.9  percent  in  combined
passenger revenues - including TWA - the Company continued to benefit
from  commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and a decrease
in  the  percentage  of  commissionable transactions.   Food  service
increased 10.1 percent, or $20 million, due primarily to the addition
of TWA.  Aircraft rentals increased $75 million, or 49.7 percent, due
to the addition of TWA aircraft.  The asset impairment charge of $685
million  relates to the writedown of the carrying value of the Company's
Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables (see footnote
8 to the condensed consolidated financial  statements). Other operating
expense  increased  25.6  percent,  or  $207  million,  and  included
approximately $131 million related to TWA.  The remaining increase is
due  primarily to increases in data processing, outsourced  services,
travel and incidental, and external contract maintenance costs.

Other  income  (expense), historically a net expense,  increased  $38
million due to a decrease in interest income of $10 million, or  29.4
percent, from the Company's lower investment balances, an increase of
$17  million in interest expense resulting from an increase in  long-
term  debt,  and  a  decrease  of  $13 million  in  miscellaneous-net
relating  primarily to the $57 million gain on sale of the  Company's
warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock  in
the  second  quarter  of 2000 versus a $45 million  gain  during  the
second  quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related
to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 and 2000

Summary  AMR's net loss for the six months ended June  30,  2001  was
$550  million,  or $3.58 loss per share.  This compares  with  income
from  continuing  operations  of $410 million,  or  $2.58  per  share
diluted, for the same period in 2000.  AMR's operating loss  for  the
six  months  ended  June  30,  2001 was  $764  million,  compared  to
operating  income of $729 million for the same period  in  2000.   On
April  9, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
and  assumed certain liabilities of TWA.  Accordingly, the  operating
results  of  TWA since the date of acquisition have been included  in
the  accompanying consolidated financial statements for the six month
period ended June 30, 2001.  In addition, AMR's 2001 results include:
(i)  a $430 million after-tax charge, or $2.79 per share, related  to
the  writedown  of the carrying value of its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and
ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables, and (ii) a $29 million after-tax
gain, or $0.19 per share, from the settlement of a legal matter related
to the Company's 1999 labor disruption. AMR's 2000 results include an
approximate $36 million after-tax gain, or $0.21 per share diluted,
related to the sale of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million
shares of priceline common stock.

The  Company's revenues increased approximately $755 million, or  7.9
percent,  during the first six months of 2001 versus the same  period
last  year.   However, excluding TWA's revenues for the period  April
10,  2001  through June 30, 2001, the Company's revenues  would  have
remained  flat versus the same period last year.  The Company's  2001
results were impacted by a slowing U.S. economy, dampening the demand
for business travel both domestically and internationally.

American's  passenger  revenues decreased  by  0.7  percent,  or  $56
million.   American's yield of 14.13 cents increased by  1.9  percent
compared  to the same period in 2000.  Domestic yields increased  2.0
percent  from  the  first six months of 2000.   International  yields
increased 2.5 percent, reflecting an increase of 5.3 percent and  1.4
percent   in   Latin  American  and  European  yields,  respectively,
partially  offset  by a decrease of 7.3 percent  in  Pacific  yields.
Yields  were up year-over-year largely due to fare increases  enacted
over  the course of 2000, which more than offset the increase in fare
sale activity during the second quarter of 2001.

American's  traffic  or RPMs decreased 2.6 percent  to  56.0  billion
miles for the six months ended June 30, 2001.  American's capacity or
ASMs  decreased 0.2 percent to 80.0 billion miles for the  first  six
months of 2001.  American's domestic traffic decreased 4.2 percent on
a  capacity  decrease  of  0.3  percent while  international  traffic
increased   0.8  percent  on  capacity  increases  of  0.2   percent.
International activity included a 12.4 percent increase in traffic to
the  Pacific  on a capacity increase of 7.5 percent,  a  0.7  percent
decrease  in traffic to Europe on a capacity increase of 2.8 percent,
and  a 0.4 percent decrease in traffic to Latin America on a capacity
decrease  of  3.3  percent.  The slight decrease in overall  capacity
year-over-year  was  due  primarily  to  the  Company's   More   Room
Throughout Coach program, which offset the addition of new aircraft.

AMR Eagle's passenger revenues increased 8.1 percent, or $57 million.
The  increase  in  passenger revenues resulted  from  a  4.2  percent
increase  in  passenger yield and a 3.7 percent increase in  traffic,
due  to  the continued addition of regional jets and steps  taken  to
improve the carrier's network.

Other  revenues increased $64 million, or 11.2 percent, due primarily
to the addition of TWA.


                                          -12-
<Page> 15
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The   Company's  operating  expenses  increased  25.4   percent,   or
approximately $2.2 billion, and included approximately  $757  million
related  to  TWA's operations for the period April 10,  2001  through
June  30, 2001.  American's cost per ASM increased by 9.2 percent  to
11.12  cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter  2001  asset
impairment  charge.   The increase in American's  cost  per  ASM  was
driven  partially  by a reduction in ASMs due to the  Company's  More
Room Throughout Coach program.  Adjusted for this program, American's
cost  per  ASM  grew approximately 4.5 percent, excluding  the  asset
impairment  charge.   Wages,  salaries and  benefits  increased  17.7
percent,  or  $581 million, and included approximately  $286  million
related   to  the  addition  of  TWA.   The  remaining  increase   of
approximately  $295 million related primarily to an increase  in  the
average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate  and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  Company's   labor
contracts.   During the six months ended June 30, 2001,  the  Company
recorded approximately $200 million in additional wages, salaries and
benefits  related to the Company's tentative labor  contracts.   This
was  mostly  offset by a $172 million decrease in the  provision  for
profit-sharing as compared to the corresponding period in  the  prior
year.  Aircraft fuel expense increased 38.3 percent, or $429 million,
and  included approximately $121 million related to the  addition  of
TWA.  The increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 23.6 percent
increase  in  the  Company's average price per  gallon  and  an  11.9
percent  increase in the Company's fuel consumption,  including  TWA.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 14.3 percent, or  $83
million,  due  primarily  to the addition  of  new  aircraft  and  an
increase of approximately $25 million related to TWA.  Other  rentals
and  landing fees increased $84 million, or 17 percent, primarily due
to the addition of TWA.  Commissions to agents decreased 8.7 percent,
or  $46  million, and included approximately $31 million  related  to
TWA.   Despite an increase of approximately 7.8 percent  in  combined
passenger revenues - including TWA - the Company continued to benefit
from  commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and a decrease
in  the  percentage of commissionable transactions.  Aircraft rentals
increased  $70  million, or 23 percent, due to the  addition  of  TWA
aircraft.  The asset impairment charge of $685 million relates to the
writedown of the carrying value of the Company's Fokker 100, Saab 340 and
ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables (see footnote 8 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements). Other operating expense increased
19.1 percent, or $308 million, and included approximately  $131  million
related to TWA.  The remaining increase is due primarily to increases
in  data processing, outsourced services, travel and incidental,  and
external contract maintenance costs.

Other  income  (expense), historically a net expense,  increased  $36
million  due  primarily  to an increase of $17  million  in  interest
expense  resulting from an increase in long-term debt, and a decrease
of  $22  million in miscellaneous-net.  The latter reflects  the  $57
million  gain  on  sale  of the Company's warrants  to  purchase  5.5
million  shares  of priceline common stock in the second  quarter  of
2000 versus a $45 million gain during the second quarter of 2001 from
the  settlement of a legal matter related to the Company's 1999 labor
disruption  and  the write-down of certain investments  held  by  the
Company during 2001.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net  cash  provided by operating activities in the six  month  period
ended  June  30,  2001 was $885 million, a decrease of  approximately
$924  million  over  the  same period in 2000,  due  primarily  to  a
decrease in income from continuing operations and a decrease  in  the
change in the air traffic liability from the corresponding period  in
the  prior  year.  Capital expenditures for the first six  months  of
2001 were $2.1 billion, and included the acquisition of 14 Boeing 737-
800s,  eight  Boeing 777-200ERs, four Boeing 757-200s, seven  Embraer
135  aircraft,  six  Embraer 145 aircraft, and  the  purchase  of  18
McDonnell  Douglas MD-80 aircraft previously leased  by  TWA.   These
capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage
and  debt  agreements.   On  April 9,  2001,  the  Company  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and assumed certain  liabilities  of
TWA  for  approximately  $742 million,  which  was  funded  from  the
Company's existing cash and short-term investments.  The $742 million
includes  the  $625 million purchase price paid to  TWA  and  various
other  acquisition costs, primarily the purchase of aircraft security
deposits  and prepaid rent.  Proceeds from the sale of equipment  and
property  of  $206  million included the proceeds received  upon  the
delivery  of  three  McDonnell  Douglas  MD-11  aircraft  to  Federal
Express.

  As  of  June  30, 2001, the Company had commitments to  acquire  the
following aircraft: 55 Boeing 737-800s, 19 Boeing 757-200s, 15  Boeing
767-300ERs,  12 Boeing 777-200ERs, 139 Embraer regional  jets  and  25
Bombardier  CRJ-700s.   Deliveries of all  aircraft  continue  through
2006.   Payments for all aircraft will approximate $1.5 billion during
the  remainder of 2001, $2.2 billion in 2002, $1.5 billion in 2003 and
an  aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion in 2004 through 2006.  The
Company  expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures  from
the  Company's  existing  cash and short-term investments,  internally
generated cash and new financing depending upon market conditions  and
the Company's evolving view of its long-term needs.

   The Company announced in January 2001 that it had agreed to acquire
or  lease  from  United Airlines, Inc. (United) certain key  strategic
assets  (slots,  gates  and aircraft) of US Airways  Group,  Inc.  (US
Airways)   and   to  jointly  operate  the  northeast   Shuttle   (New
York/Washington/Boston)  with  United upon  the  consummation  of  the
previously  announced  merger  between  United  and  US  Airways.   In
addition,  American  announced that it had  agreed  to  acquire  a  49
percent  stake in, and to enter into an exclusive marketing  agreement
with, D.C. Air, LLC (D.C. Air).

                                          -14-
<Page> 17
  On  July  27,  2001, United and US Airways announced that  they  had
agreed   to  terminate  the  merger  agreement  between  them.    Upon
termination  of that merger agreement, the agreement between  American
and United automatically terminated.  In addition, as the transactions
between American and D.C. Air were contingent upon the closing of  the
United-US Airways merger, the transactions between American  and  D.C.
Air discussed above will not be consummated.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In   July  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statements  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  141,  "Business
Combinations"  (SFAS 141) and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other  Intangible
Assets"  (SFAS  142).  SFAS 141 prohibits the use of  the  pooling-of-
interests  method for business combinations initiated after  June  30,
2001  and  includes criteria for the recognition of intangible  assets
separately from goodwill.  SFAS 142 includes the requirement  to  test
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  rather
than  amortize  them.  The Company will adopt SFAS 142  in  the  first
quarter   of   2002,   and  currently  estimates   discontinuing   the
amortization of approximately $62 million on an annualized basis.  The
Company  is  currently  evaluating what additional  impact  these  new
accounting  standards may have on the Company's financial position  or
results of operations.

OUTLOOK FOR 2001

The  Company  expects the soft revenue environment experienced  during
the  first  half of the year to continue throughout the  remainder  of
2001.   In  addition, the Company expects to see significantly  higher
labor  costs,  given  recent industry trends and  American's  recently
negotiated  tentative  agreements  with  its  flight  attendants   and
mechanics.   In  response to the resulting earnings pressure,  coupled
with the continued uncertainty surrounding fuel costs, the Company has

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

There  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from  the
information   provided  in  Item  7A.  Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk of the Company's Annual Report on  Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, except as discussed below.

  Based on projected fuel usage for the next twelve months, including
the  Company's estimated fuel consumption for TWA, a hypothetical  10
percent  increase in the June 30, 2001 cost per gallon of fuel  would
result  in  an  increase in the Company's aircraft  fuel  expense  of
approximately $210 million for the next twelve months,  net  of  fuel
hedge instruments outstanding at June 30, 2001.  The change in market
risk  from December 31, 2000 is due primarily to the additional  fuel
consumption  of TWA, partially offset by a decrease in  fuel  prices.
As  of  June  30,  2001, the Company, including  the  estimated  fuel
consumption  of  TWA,  has hedged approximately  43  percent  of  its
remaining  2001  fuel  requirements, 28  percent  of  its  2002  fuel
requirements, and 16 percent of its 2003 fuel requirements.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between  American
and  American Eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay monies to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin American  from  enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus  treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  Defendants'
motion  to  dismiss  all  claims  is  pending.   American  intends  to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that the
litigation  is  without  merit, adverse court decisions  could  impose
restrictions  on  American's ability to respond  to  competitors,  and
American's business may be adversely impacted.

   On May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division
of   the  Department  of  Justice)  sued  AMR  Corporation,  American
Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in
Wichita,   Kansas.  The  lawsuit  alleges  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) by increasing
service  when  new competitors began flying to DFW, and  by  matching
these  new  competitors' fares.  The Department of Justice  seeks  to
enjoin American from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and  to
impose  restraints on American to remedy the alleged effects  of  its
past  conduct.   On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court  for  the
District  of  Kansas granted American's motion for summary  judgment.
On  June  26,  2001,  the  U.S. Department of  Justice  appealed  the
granting  of American's motion for summary judgment.  The  government
has  requested  that  the  10th Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  set  the
following  briefing schedule: the government's brief to be  filed  on
September  28,  2001; American's response to be  filed  November  20,
2001;  and  the government's reply to be filed on December 11,  2001.
American  did not oppose the government's request.  No date has  been
set  for  oral  argument.  American intends  to  defend  the  lawsuit
vigorously.

   Between May 14, 1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees
(King v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric
v.  AMR  Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v.  AMR
Corp.,  et  al.;  Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl  v.  AMR
Corp.,  et  al.).  Collectively, these lawsuits allege that  American
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from DFW by increasing service when new  competitors
began  flying  to DFW, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
Two  of  the  suits  (Smith  and Wright) also  allege  that  American
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from DFW by offering discounted fares  to  corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions  on  the  use and availability of certain  fares,  and  by
offering override commissions to travel agents. The suits propose  to
certify  several classes of consumers, the broadest of which  is  all
persons who purchased tickets for air travel on American into or  out
of DFW since 1995 to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District
Court  stayed all of these actions pending developments in  the  case
brought by the Department of Justice.  As a result, to date no  class
has  been  certified.   American intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits
vigorously.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

   In  June 2001, the named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit, Hall
v.  United Airlines, et al., No. 7:00 CV 123-BR(1), sought  leave  to
file  an amended complaint that would substantially increase the size
and  scope  of the pending litigation.  The Hall case was  originally
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina against American and other airlines, and alleged  that
during  1999, American and the other defendant airlines conspired  to
reduce  commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation  of
Section  1 of the Sherman Act.  The proposed amended complaint  seeks
to  add  additional  named  plaintiffs and  defendants,  and  to  add
allegations that American and other airlines also conspired to reduce
commission rates from 10 percent to 8 percent in September  1997  and
to  cap  commissions  for international travel at  $50  each  way  in
October 1998.  Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is pending,  and
no  class  has yet been certified.  American is vigorously  defending
the lawsuit.

  The    Miami    International   Airport   Authority   is   currently
investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at  the
Miami  International Airport (the Airport) and funding the remediation
costs through various cost recovery methods.  American Airlines,  Inc.
and  AMR  Eagle  have  been named as potentially  responsible  parties
(PRPs)  and  contributors  to the contamination.   During  the  second
quarter  of  2001, the Airport filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,
including American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover  its  past
and  future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition  to
the  17  defendants  named  in the lawsuit,  243  other  agencies  and
companies   were   also  named  as  PRPs  and  contributors   to   the
contamination.  American and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup  costs
cannot  be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including  the
unknown  extent  of  the remedial actions that may  be  required,  the
proportion  of  the  cost that will ultimately be recovered  from  the
responsible  parties,  and uncertainties regarding  the  environmental
agencies  that  will ultimately supervise the remedial activities  and
the nature of that supervision. American is vigorously defending the
lawsuit.
