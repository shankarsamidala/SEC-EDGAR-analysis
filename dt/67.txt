              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 MARCH 31, 1997
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)

1.   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Organization and Basis of Presentation

     American Pad & Paper Company (the "Company") is a holding company which
conducts its operations through American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.
and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

     The financial statements of the Company present the accounts and
operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Additionally, the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Notepad Funding
Corporation, a special purpose corporation utilized in the accounts receivable
facility.  All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.  Certain
prior and current year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.

     Business

     The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
paper-based office products in North America. The Company operates in one
business segment, converting paper into office products, and offers a broad
assortment of products through two complementary divisions:  Ampad (writing
pads, file folders, retail envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based
office products) and Williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). The
Company's products are distributed through large mass merchant retailers,
office product superstores, warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office
products wholesalers, paper merchants, and independent dealers.  Substantially
all sales are to customers within the United States.

     Interim Financial Information

     The accompanying interim financial statements and pro forma information
are unaudited.  Certain information and disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted, although the Company believes the
disclosures included herein are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1996.

     The accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of the Company's financial position at March 31, 1997, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the three month periods ended
March 31, 1997 and 1996.  The results of operations for the interim periods
presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full
fiscal year.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION - SHADE/ALLIED, INC.

     Effective February 11, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
common and preferred stock of Shade/Allied, Inc., ("Shade/Allied") for
approximately $51,300, consisting of $49,500 in cash and $1,800 in direct
acquisition costs, financed by the Company's bank credit agreement.  This
acquisition has been recorded following the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets
and liabilities at their fair market values.  The excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill
and amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.  The Company
preliminarily allocated the purchase price as follows:  trade accounts
receivable of $4,584, inventories of $5,941, other current assets of $929,
property, plant and equipment of $10,685, current liabilities of $13,877,
long-term liabilities of $3,323 and goodwill of $46,361.  The results of
operations of Shade/Allied are included in the Company's results of operations
from the date of acquisition through March 31, 1997.

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Effective December 15, 1997, the Company will report basic and diluted
earnings per share following the guidance provided in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Number 128, Earnings Per Share.  Basic earnings per share
will be computed as the quotient of net income divided by the actual number of
outstanding shares of common stock at the end of a period.  Diluted earnings
per share will be computed as the quotient of net income divided by the number
of outstanding shares of common stock as adjusted for common stock options.
The adjustment for common stock options will be calculated by assuming that all
dilutive options are exercised, that the proceeds from such exercise are used
to repurchase shares of the Company's stock at the average price of the common
stock during the period and that the Company will also generate proceeds and
repurchase shares from the tax benefits associated with the assumed exercise of
the common stock options.  Early adoption of this new accounting standard is
not permitted nor is the Company permitted to present the earnings per share
information calculated following this guidance on the face of the Company's
income statement.

     If the Company had determined its earnings per share under the new
accounting standard, the following information would be presented for the three
month period March 31, 1997 and 1996:

              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 MARCH 31, 1997
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)





     The Company intends to adopt the new accounting standard effective
December 31, 1997 and will present the basic and diluted earnings per share
information as part of the quarterly financial data in the Company's annual
report to shareholders.

     Given the changes in the Company's capital structure effected in
connection with the initial public offering of the Company's common stock,
historical earnings per share for 1996 are not presented in the condensed
consolidated statement of income as it is not considered to be meaningful.  Pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding reflect conversion of the preferred
stock into common stock for the same periods outstanding as the underlying
common stock on which the preferred stock was issued and the initial public
offering of common stock.

     The pro forma weighted average shares outstanding gives effect to the
8.1192-for-one stock split and has been adjusted to reflect as outstanding,
using the treasury stock method at the estimated initial public offering price,
all shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options granted subsequent to
April 25, 1995 (one year prior to the initial public offering filing date
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules).

8. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY

     The 13% senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by Shade/Allied, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.
("Delaware").  The subsidiary guaranty is full, unconditional and joint and
several.  The Company is not a guarantor of the senior subordinated notes.
Separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiary are not presented
because management has determined that they would not be material to investors.
However, condensed consolidating financial information as of March 31, 1997
and for the three months ended is presented.  Shade/Allied was acquired by
Delaware on February 11, 1997 and, as a result, the three month period ended
March 31, 1997 is the first period in which the Company's historical results
include the results of operations of Shade/Allied and is the first period where
Shade/Allied was a guarantor subsidiary.  The condensed consolidating financial
information is as follows:

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
       OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

       The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
nationally branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding
copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products
industry. The Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing
pads, file folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products.
Through its Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important
suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies,
machine papers and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing
office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is
the leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business
envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its
future operating results will not be directly comparable to its historical
operating results because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost
savings from integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not
generally been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may
affect prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.

      Strategic Acquisition.  On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired
Shade/Allied, a national supplier of machine papers, principally continuous
computer forms.  The purchase price of $51.2 million was financed with
borrowings under the Company's new bank credit agreement.  The Company expects
that Shade/Allied's products will be distributed by both the Ampad and
Williamhouse divisions and that the manufacturing plants will be integrated
into the Ampad division.  This acquisition provided the Company with a more
significant position in a fourth product category.

      Purchase Accounting Effects.   The Company's acquisitions have been
accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
(including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such
as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill,
which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each
year.

      Paper Prices.  Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of goods
sold.  While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1% annually
since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price volatility
during that period.  Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted new pricing
policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the Company's cost
of paper at the time of shipment.  The Company believes that it is able to
price its products so as to minimize the impact of price volatility on dollar
margins.  Paper price volatility has and is expected to continue to have an
effect on net sales and cost of sales.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995.  The Company's historical results of operations for each
of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the following
business acquired by the Company: (i) SCM which was acquired on July 5, 1994,
(ii) Globe-Weis which was acquired on August 18, 1995, (iii) Williamhouse which
was acquired on October 31, 1995, (iv) Niagara which was acquired on June 28,
1996 and (v) Shade/Allied which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                                  (CONTINUED)




THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1997 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996

     Net Sales for the three months ended March 31, 1997 increased by $29.7
million, or 24.7%, to $149.8 million from $120.1 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1996.  Of this net sales increase, $26.5 million is related to
the acquisition of Niagara and $11.0 million is related to the acquisition of
the Shade/Allied.  Net sales from existing operations decreased by
approximately $7.8 million primarily due to the deflationary effect of paper
prices from the first quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 1997 which
negatively affected net sales by approximately 5%.

     Gross Profit for the three months ended March 31, 1997 increased by $7.5
million, or 31.9%, to $31.0 million from $23.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1996.  Approximately $3.6 million of the increase in gross
profit is attributable to the acquisition of Niagara and $1.1 million is
attributable to the Shade/Allied acquisition. Gross profit increased by $2.8
million due to increased sales of higher margin products.  Gross profit margin
increased to 20.7% for the three months ended March 31, 1997 from 19.6% for the
three months ended March 31, 1996.  The increase in gross profit margin is
primarily attributable to a higher proportion of proprietary product sales
during the first quarter of 1997.

     SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 1997 increased $3.3
million, or 31.4%, to $13.8 from $10.5 million for the three months ended March
31, 1996.  Approximately $2.3 million is attributable to the acquisitions of
Niagara and Shade/Allied.  Management fees and services during the first
quarter increased by approximately $1.3 million due primarily to a one year
non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara, an
envelope company acquired in June 1996.

     Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 1997 decreased $4.3
million to $8.2 million from $12.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
1996.  The decrease is primarily attributable to repayment of the old credit
agreement indebtedness of $95.8 million and the redemption of $70.0 million
aggregate principal amount of the 13% senior subordinated notes both of which
were funded by the proceeds of the Company's initial public offering of common
stock.  This decrease in indebtedness was partially offset by increased
borrowings as a result of the Shade/Allied acquisition.

     The income tax provision for the three month period ended March 31, 1997
reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate of 44.3%
for the three month period ended March 31, 1996.  The increase is attributable
primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the
acquisitions.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1996 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1995

     Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased by $72.6
million, or 152.8%, to $120.1 million from $47.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1995. Of this net sales increase, $63.2 million is related to
the Williamhouse acquisition and $15.9 million is related to the Globe-Weis
acquisition. Ampad division net sales, exclusive of Globe-Weis, decreased by
$6.5 million in the first quarter of 1996 compared to the unusually strong
first quarter of 1995. The strong 1995 first quarter was due to certain of the
Company's customers increasing inventory levels in anticipation of price
increases and supply shortages.

     Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased by $18.2
million, or 343.4%, to $23.5 million from $5.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1995. Approximately $15.5 million of the increase in gross
profit is attributable to the Williamhouse acquisition and $2.0 million is
attributable to the Globe-Weis acquisition. The gross profit from the Ampad
division, exclusive of Globe-Weis, increased by $.7 million, due to a change in
the mix of products sold towards higher margin products. Gross profit margin
increased to 19.6% for the three months ended March 31, 1996 from 11.2% for the
three months ended March 31, 1995. This increase in gross profit margin is
related to unfavorable inventory valuation of $2.6 million in the first quarter
of 1995 due to rising paper prices. In addition, the Company's ability to
maintain its dollar margins in the first quarter of 1996 despite a falling
price environment led to higher margin percentages.

     SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased $7.9
million, or 288.9%, to $10.5 million  from $2.6 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1995. Approximately $7.3 million of the increase is
attributable to the Williamhouse acquisition and includes $1.0 million of
amortization of goodwill and intangibles and $.3 million of costs

related to the off balance sheet financing of receivables. As a percentage of
net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 8.8% for the first three months of 1996
from 5.5% in the comparable period for the prior year as a result of higher SG&A
expenses as a percentage of net sales of the Williamhouse division.

     Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased $10.9
million to $12.5 million from $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31,
1995. The increase is attributable primarily to increased borrowings as a
result of the sale of the 13% senior subordinated notes in December 1995, the
Williamhouse acquisition in October 1995 and the Globe-Weis acquisition in
August 1995.

     The income tax provision for the three month period ended March 31, 1996
reflects an effective tax rate of 44.4%, versus an effective tax rate of 38.3%
for the three month period ended March 31, 1995. The increase is attributable
primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting from the
Williamhouse acquisition.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Net cash used by operating activities for the three months ended March 31,
1997 was $13.9 million compared to net cash provided of $7.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 1996.  This decrease in cash provided by operating
activities is due to a combination of the following: (i) a reduction of
accounts receivable of $21.6 million as seasonal and year end accounts
receivable were collected during the quarter, (ii) an increase in inventories
of $21.6 million due to a buildup of inventory levels in anticipation of
seasonal, promotional and new product sales in the second and third quarters,
(iii) a normal reduction of accounts payable by $8.9 million and (iv) a
reduction in accrued expenses of $16.7 million as customer volume rebates and
incentive compensation were paid during the first quarter of 1997.

     Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31,
1997 and 1996 was $54.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively.  The use of
cash for the three months ended March 31, 1997 was due to the Shade/Allied
Acquisition ($50.5 million) and purchases of equipment ($4.0 million).

     Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31,
1997 was $67.3 million compared to cash used by financing activities for the
three months ended March 31, 1996 of $2.9 million. During the first quarter of
1997, the Company repaid $13.0 million in notes outstanding under its accounts
receivable credit facility and borrowed $79.8 million to finance (i) such
repayment, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the purchases of
equipment and (iv) its working capital needs.

     Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit
agreement and available cash on hand at March 31, 1997 of $1.1 million, will be
adequate for the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and
interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital
expenditures, including anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $13
million during the remainder of 1997, and working capital requirements, and to
enable the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with the terms of their debt
 agreements.  However, actual capital requirements may change, particularly as
a result of any acquisitions which the Company may make.  The ability of the 
Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be
dependent, however, upon the future performance of the Company and its 
subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject to general economic conditions 
and to financial, business and other factors, including factors beyond the 
Company's control. A portion of the consolidated debt of the Company bears 
interest at floating rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will 
continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company 
has entered into an interest rate protection agreement to minimize the impact 
from a rise in interest rates.

INFLATION

     The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 1997 and 1996.

NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which is effective
December 15, 1997 and which prescribes a new presentation of earnings per share
amounts as either "basic" or "diluted."  Basic earnings per share is to be
calculated as net income divided by the number of outstanding shares of common
stock.  Diluted earnings per share is to be calculated in a manner similar to
the "primary" earnings per share currently presented by the Company.  Diluted
earnings per share is calculated as net income divided the number of
outstanding shares of common stock, as adjusted for common stock options.  The
Company intends to implement the new accounting at the end of 1997 and, as part
of its 1997 annual report to shareholders and Form 10-K, will restate its
quarterly earnings per share following the guidelines in the new accounting
standard.  If the new standard had been implemented during the first quarter of
1997, earnings per share would have been presented as follows:
