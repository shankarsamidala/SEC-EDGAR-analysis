1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION
     AMERCO, a Nevada corporation (AMERCO), is the holding company for U-Haul
International, Inc. (U-Haul), Amerco Real Estate Company (Real Estate), Republic
Western Insurance Company (RepWest) and Oxford Life Insurance Company (Oxford).

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
     The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
parent corporation, AMERCO, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All material
intercompany accounts and transactions of AMERCO and its subsidiaries have been
eliminated.  The financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by
Form 10-Q and do not contain certain information included in AMERCO's annual
financial statements and notes.

     The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and the
related condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the three and nine
months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the condensed consolidated
statements of comprehensive income and the condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
of such condensed financial statements have been included.  Such adjustments
consisted only of normal recurring items.  Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full year.

     The operating results and financial position of AMERCO's consolidated
insurance operations are determined on a one quarter lag.  There were no effects
related to intervening events which would materially affect the consolidated
financial position or results of operations for the financial statements
presented herein.

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements for
the three and nine months ended December 31, 1999 to conform with the current
year's presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
     During the quarter ended September 30, 2000, AMERCO adopted Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements", which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in the financial statements filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The adoption of SAB 101 was not material to AMERCO's
condensed consolidated financial statements.

4.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

     During the nine months ended December 31, 2000, a subsidiary of U-Haul
entered into 33 transactions whereby the subsidiary sold rental trucks, trailers
and support rental items which were subsequently leased back.  AMERCO has
guaranteed $60,725,000 of residual values at December 31, 2000 for these assets
at the end of the respective lease terms.  U-Haul also entered into one
transaction where it leased computer equipment and one transaction where it
leased general rental items.  Following are the lease commitments for the leases
executed during the nine months ended December 31, 2000, and subsequently which
have a term of more than one year (in thousands):

     In the normal course of business, AMERCO is a defendant in a number of
suits and claims.  AMERCO is also a party to several administrative proceedings
arising from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or clean-
up of underground fuel storage tanks.  It is the opinion of management that
none of such suits, claims or proceedings involving AMERCO, individually or in
the aggregate are expected to result in a material loss.

7.  RELATED PARTIES

     During the nine months ended December 31, 2000, subsidiaries of AMERCO held
various senior and junior notes with SAC Holding Corporation and its
subsidiaries (SAC Holdings).  The voting common stock of SAC Holdings is held by
Mark V. Shoen, a major stockholder of AMERCO.  AMERCO's subsidiaries received
interest payments of $26,318,000 and principal payments of $795,000 from SAC
Holdings during the nine months ended December 31, 2000.  The terms of the notes
with SAC Holdings are consistent with the terms of notes held by U-Haul for
other properties owned by unrelated parties and managed by U-Haul.  These
amounts are reflected in Investments, other of the condensed consolidated
balance sheet.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2000, a subsidiary of
AMERCO funded through a note the purchase of properties and construction costs
for SAC Holdings of approximately $182,576,000.  This amount is reflected in
Investments, other of the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

     U-Haul currently manages the properties owned by SAC Holdings pursuant to a
management agreement, under which U-Haul receives a management fee equal to 6%
of the gross receipts from the properties.  Management fees of $4,523,000 and
$3,348,000 were received during the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.  The management fee percentage is consistent with the fees
received by U-Haul for other properties owned by unrelated parties and managed
by U-Haul.

     In June 2000, Real Estate completed the sale of twenty-four storage
properties to Twelve SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Thirteen SAC Self-Storage
Corporation and Fourteen SAC Self-Storage Corporation, subsidiaries of SAC
Holding Corporation, for $98,351,000.  Real Estate received cash and notes from
the sale.  The gain is reflected in the equity section of the condensed
consolidated balance sheet.

     Management believes that the foregoing transactions were consummated on
terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions.

GENERAL
     Information on industry segments is incorporated by reference from "Item 1.
Financial Statements - Notes 1, 3 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements".  The notes discuss the principles of consolidation, summarized
consolidated financial information and industry segment and geographical area
data, respectively.  In consolidation, all intersegment premiums are eliminated
and the benefits, losses and expenses are retained by the insurance companies.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

Moving and Storage Operations
     Revenues consist of rental revenues, net sales and investment and interest
income.  Total rental revenue was $951.1 million and $907.8 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net revenues from the
rental of moving related equipment increased by $35.8 million.  This increase is
primarily attributable to higher truck and trailer rental revenues.  Storage
revenues increased $8.2 million due to increases in rates and in the number of
storage rooms rented.

     Net sales revenues were $155.1 million and $148.7 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth resulted
from the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.), which led to the
majority of the increase, and from an increase in the sale of hitches.

     Net investment and interest income was $22.4 million and $15.0 million for
the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is
due to increased investments.

     Cost of sales was $87.6 million and $87.7 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Operating expenses before intercompany eliminations were $742.8 million and
$721.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Increased expenditure levels for personnel and rental equipment
maintenance, due to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size,
were primarily responsible.

     Net depreciation expense was $59.8 million and $54.8 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase reflects
depreciation on the rental truck fleet.

     Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $103.5 million
and $98.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
<PAGE> 21
Real Estate Operations
     Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $54.1 million and $55.0
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Intercompany revenue was $52.6 million and $53.1 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Net investment and interest income was $7.8 million and $5.7 million for
the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase
correlates to an increase in investments in notes and mortgages.

     Net depreciation expense was $8.0 million and $6.8 million for the nine
months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase is due to
the build out of storage facilities.

     Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $12.2 million
and $18.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.

Property and Casualty
     RepWest's premiums were $135.7 million and $100.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  General agency premiums
were $37.5 million and $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2000 and 1999, respectively.  Assumed treaty reinsurance premium was $50.5
million and $35.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Rental industry revenue was $28.2 million and $35.6 million for
the nine months ending September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This change
was caused by the restructuring of the rental industry Business Auto General
Liability Policy.

     Net investment income was $23.7 million and $24.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The reduction is
attributable to decreased gains and decreased invested assets.

     Benefits and losses were $116.4 million and $82.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase is due to
new agency programs in Non-Standard Auto and Transportation, as well as in
assumed treaty reinsurance business.

     The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) was $10.1 million and
$10.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Operating expenses were $37.8 million and $23.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is a result of
commissions on new agency business premium writings as well as assumed
reinsurance treaties, increased personnel expenses and changes in claims
handling procedures.

     Operating profit (loss) before tax and intercompany elimination was $(4.9)
million and $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease is the result of additional incurred losses and
operating expense, and decreased investment income, offset by an increase in
earned premiums.

Life Insurance
     Net premiums were $78.3 million and $71.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The difference was primarily due to
a $2.5 million increase in the credit insurance lines and a $4.1 million
increase in the Medicare supplement line.  Premiums related to other health
insurance products increased $0.4 million.  Earned premiums from life insurance
and annuitizations decreased $0.2 million.

     Net investment income before intercompany eliminations was $18.2 million
and $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increase was due to improved interest rate spreads on the
interest sensitive products and a larger invested asset base.

     Benefits were $54.2 million and $44.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Medicare supplement benefits
increased $6.4 million from 1999 and credit insurance benefits increased $2.0
million from 1999.  Other health insurance benefits increased $1.6 million for
the year primarily from one-time charges and poor group disability experience.
Annuity benefits increased $0.8 million from 1999.  The life insurance lines
have had better mortality experience in 2000, resulting in a $1.2 million
decrease in benefits from 1999.

     Amortization of DAC was $15.0 million and $17.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease is due to credit
reinsurance.

     Operating expenses were $19.9 million and $15.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is due to
premium volume increases.

     Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $7.4 million
and $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease is due to loss ratios on the Medicare supplement
business and Credit insurance business.

Interest Expense
     Interest expense was $65.2 million and $61.0 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed
to increases in the average debt outstanding and in the average cost of debt.

Consolidated Group
     As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $95.5 million and
$116.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  After providing for income taxes, net earnings from operations
were $61.7 million and $75.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively.  Following deductions for an extraordinary loss from the
early extinguishment of debt, net earnings were $59.6 million and $75.1 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

Moving and Storage Operations
     Revenues consist of rental revenues, net sales and investment and interest
income.  Total rental revenue was $270.8 million and $264.8 million for the
quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net revenues from the
rental of moving related equipment increased by $4.0 million. This increase is
primarily attributable to higher truck and trailer rental revenues.  Storage
revenues increased $2.0 million due to increases in rates and in the number of
storage rooms rented.

     Net sales revenues was $41.1 million and $38.5 million for the quarters
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth resulted from
the sale of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) which led to the majority of
the increase during the quarter.

     Net investment and interest income was $8.9 million and $5.2 million for
the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is
due to increased investments.

     Cost of sales was $21.6 million and $25.0 million for the quarters ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Operating expenses before intercompany elimination were $251.0 million and
$244.6 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The increase reflects higher personnel and rental equipment maintenance
expenditures associated with an increase in truck rental transactions and
inventory levels.

     Net depreciation expense was $20.6 million and $20.8 million for the
quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Operating loss before tax and intercompany elimination was $18.0 million
and $19.7 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Real Estate Operations
     Rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was $18.0 million and
$18.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Intercompany revenue remained constant at $17.8 million for the quarters ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999.

     Net investment and interest income was $2.8 million and $0.9 million for
the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase
correlates to an increase in investments in notes and mortgages.

     Net depreciation expense was $2.7 million and $2.2 million for the
quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was $4.1 million
and $4.5 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease reflects increases in lease expenses.
<PAGE> 24
Property and Casualty
     RepWest's premiums were $63.4 million and $35.7 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is directly
related to general agency premiums, which were $17.3 million and $3.4 million
for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Assumed
treaty reinsurance premium were $27.5 million and $14.1 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Net investment income was $8.0 million and $8.1 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Benefits and losses incurred were $56.3 million and $28.7 million for the
quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase is a
result of new general agency business writings in Non-Standard Auto and
Transportation, as well as in assumed treaty reinsurance business.

     The amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) was $3.8 million and
$3.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The increase is due to the increase in new business.

     Operating expenses were $18.0 million and $7.8 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The change is due to increased
commission expense resulting from new agency business premium writings on Non
Standard Auto and Transportation coverages, as well as assumed treaty business.
General and administrative expenses also increased due to an increase in
personnel and overhead required to support new business expansion.

     Operating profit (loss) before tax and intercompany elimination was $(6.8)
million and $4.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  This decrease is the result of increased incurred losses and
operating expense, offset by an increase in earned premiums.
<PAGE> 25
Life Insurance
     Net premiums were $26.8 million and $24.3 million for the quarters ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The change is primarily due to a
$0.3 million increase in the credit insurance line and a $1.5 million increase
in the Medicare supplement line.  Annuitizations and premiums from other health
and life insurance products increased $0.7 million.

     Net investment income before intercompany eliminations remained constant
at $5.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999.

     Benefits were $18.5 million and $14.3 million for the quarters ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Medicare supplement benefits
increased $2.7 million from 1999 due to higher loss ratios.  Other health
insurance benefits increased $0.9 million due to poor group disability
experience.  Annuity benefits increased $0.6 million.

     Amortization of DAC was $4.8 million and $6.1 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Amortization from annuities
decreased $0.5 million, other health insurance amortization decreased $0.2
million and the credit insurance amortization decreased $0.6 million for the
quarter.

     Operating expenses were $6.6 million and $5.9 million for the quarters
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This increase included $1.6
million in Medical Supplement commissions to agents, partially offset by a
decrease of $0.8 million in administration costs and surrender charge income of
$0.2 million.

     Operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was $2.6 million
and $3.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease is due to loss ratios on the Medicare supplement
business.

Interest Expense
     Interest expense was unchanged at $21.2 million for the quarters ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999.

Consolidated Group
     As a result of the foregoing, pretax loss was $26.6 million and $14.8
million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  After
providing for income taxes, net loss from operations was $17.1 million and $9.3
million for the quarters ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Following deductions for an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of
debt, net loss was $19.2 million and $9.3 million for the quarters ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Moving and Storage Operations
     To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul maintains a large inventory of
rental items.  In the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, capital
expenditures were $280.0 million and $269.5 million, respectively.  These
expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck fleet.  The
capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally
generated funds from operations and through lease financings.

     Cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($33.4) million and
$128.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in receivables.

     At December 31, 2000, total outstanding notes and loans payable was
$1,182.1 million as compared to $1,137.8 million at March 31, 2000.

Real Estate Operations
     Cash provided by operating activities was $75.8 million and $6.3 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
increase resulted from an increase in accounts payable.

Property and Casualty
     Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $20.3 million and $(9.2)
million for nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  This
change resulted from increases in unearned premium, funds withheld and decreased
accounts receivable from December 1999 to September 2000.  The increase was
offset by a decrease in loss and loss adjusting expense reserves from December
1999 to September 2000 and decreased net income.

     RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
were $12.0 million and $1.4 million at September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increase is a result of $5.4 million in short-term assets
that were on hand at September 2000 to cover a pending securities settlement.
In addition, short-term assets were increased during the period due to increased
claim payments generated by new business.

     RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 97.2% of total
liabilities.

     The liability for reported and unreported losses is based upon company
historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on
historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.  Unpaid loss
and loss expenses are not discounted.
<PAGE> 27
Life Insurance
     Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the investment
portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an
important consideration.

     Cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($0.3) million and $5.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The decrease is due to higher benefit payouts in relation to collected premium.
Cash provided (used) by financing activities was $7.1 million and ($0.1) million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The
increase is due to a better ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals.

     In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
portfolio. Short-term investments were $59.7 million and $52.1 million for the
nine months ending September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Management
believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable
cash needs.

Consolidated Group
     During each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, AMERCO
estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately $313 million
primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of capital expenditures,
combined with an average of approximately $72 million in annual long-term debt
maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average
funding needs of approximately $385 million.

Credit Agreements
     AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-term
notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.
Principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, AMERCO routinely enters
into sale and leaseback transactions.  As of December 31, 2000, AMERCO had
$1,182.1 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized
lines of credit of approximately $67.2 million.

     Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing
certain additional liens on its properties, assets and restricting the issuance
of certain types of preferred stock.  At December 31, 2000, AMERCO was in
compliance with these covenants.

     Reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in AMERCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000
for additional information about AMERCO's credit agreements.

                           PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION


                           ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In the normal course of business, AMERCO is a defendant in a number of
suits and claims.  AMERCO is also a party to several administrative proceedings
arising from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or cleanup
of underground fuel storage tanks.  It is the opinion of management that none of
the suits, claims or proceedings involving AMERCO, individually or in the
aggregate, are expected to result in a material loss.

     Reference is made to Part I, Item 1, Business, in AMERCO's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 for a discussion of certain
environmental proceedings.

     On June 24, 1997, five (5) current and/or former Moving Center General
Managers (GMs) and one (1) Area Field Manager (AFM) filed suit in Marin County
Superior Court, Case No. BC 203532, entitled Sarah Saunders, et. al. vs. U-Haul
                                             -----------------------     ------
Company of California, Inc., claiming that they were entitled to be compensated
- ---------------------------
for all overtime hours worked.  In addition, these Plaintiffs sought class
action status purporting to represent all persons employed in California as
either a salaried GM or AFM since September 1993.  On September 30, 1997, a
virtually identical lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case
No. BC 178775, entitled Wyatt Crandall vs. U-Haul International, Inc. and U-Haul
                        --------------     -------------------------------------
Co. of California.  This action did not include AFMs, but did purport to be
- -----------------
brought on behalf of GMs and GM trainees.  These cases were consolidated by the
Court in Los Angeles on October 15, 1998.  On June 10, 1999, Plaintiff's motion
to certify the AFMs as a class was denied and the motion to certify the GMs as a
class was granted.  Notice of certification was mailed on or about August 24,
1999.  The class opt-out period ended on October 11, 1999.  The case was
bifurcated and the liability portion of the case was tried to the Court
beginning in November 2000.  The Court found for the Plaintiffs on January 8,
2001.  The damage portion of the case will be tried to the Court beginning
April 9, 2001.  Management does not expect the Plaintiffs' damage claims to
result in a material loss; however, there remains the possibility that an
adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on AMERCO's results of
operations for the year in which the judgment is rendered.

                          -----------------------------

          THIS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered
     into as of January 29, 2001 among Fifteen SAC Self-Storage
     Corporation, a Nevada corporation, with its principal place of
     business at 715 South Country Club Drive, Mesa, AZ 85210 ("Owner"),
     and the property managers identified on Exhibit A attached hereto and
                                             ---------
     incorporated herein by reference (each such property manager is
     respectively referred to herein as "U-Haul").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

          A.  Owner owns the real property and self-storage related
     improvements thereon located at the street addresses identified on

     than those presently managed by U-Haul and its affiliates (whether or
     not such other facilities may be in direct or indirect competition
     with Owner) and may in the future engage in other business which may

     tenants. U-Haul may jointly advertise the Property with other
     properties owned or managed by U-Haul, and in that event, U-Haul
     shall reasonably allocate the cost of such advertising among such
     properties.

          (c) REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS.  U-Haul shall make,
     execute, supervise and have control over the making and executing of
     all decisions concerning the acquisition of furniture, fixtures and
     supplies for the Property, and may purchase, lease or otherwise
     acquire the same on behalf of Owner.  U-Haul shall make and execute,
     or supervise and have control over the making and executing of all
     decisions concerning the maintenance, repair, and landscaping of the
     Property. U-Haul shall, on behalf of Owner, negotiate and contract
     for and supervise the installation of all capital improvements
     related to the Property; provided, however, that U-Haul agrees to
     secure the prior written approval of Owner on all such expenditures
     in excess of $5,000.00 for any one item, except monthly or recurring
     operating charges and/or emergency repairs if in the opinion of
     U-Haul such emergency-related expenditures are necessary to protect the
     Property from damage or to maintain services to the tenants as called
     for in their respective leases.

          (d) PERSONNEL.  U-Haul shall select all vendors, suppliers,
     contractors, subcontractors and employees with respect to the
     Property and shall hire, discharge and supervise all labor and
<PAGE>
     employees required for the operation and maintenance of the Property.
     Any employees so hired shall be employees of U-Haul, and shall be
     carried on the payroll of U-Haul.  Employees may include, but will
     not be limited to, on-site resident managers, on-site assistant
     managers, and relief managers located, rendering services, or
     performing activities on the Property in connection with its
     operation and management.  The cost of employing such persons shall
     not exceed prevailing rates for comparable persons performing the
     same or similar services with respect to real estate similar to the
     Property.

          (e) AGREEMENTS.  U-Haul shall negotiate and execute on behalf of
     Owner such agreements which U-Haul deems necessary or advisable for
     the furnishing of utilities, services, concessions and supplies, for
     the maintenance, repair and operation of the Property and such other
     agreements which may benefit the Property or be incidental to the
     matters for which U-Haul is responsible hereunder.

          (f) OTHER DECISIONS.  U-Haul shall make all decisions in
     connection with the daily operation of the Property.

          (g) REGULATIONS AND PERMITS.  U-Haul shall comply in all
     material respects with any statute, ordinance, law, rule, regulation
     or order of any governmental or regulatory body, having jurisdiction
     over the Property, respecting the use of the Property or the
     maintenance or operation thereof.  U-Haul shall apply for and attempt
     to obtain and maintain, on behalf of Owner, all licenses and permits
     required or advisable (in the sole judgment of U-Haul) in connection
     with the management and operation of the Property.

          (h) RECORDS AND REPORTS OF DISBURSEMENTS AND COLLECTIONS.  U-Haul
     shall establish, supervise, direct and maintain the operation of a
     system of record keeping and bookkeeping with respect to all receipts
     and disbursements in connection with the management and operation of
     the Property.  The books, records and accounts shall be maintained at
     the U-Haul office or at such other location as U-Haul shall determine,
     and shall be available and open to examination and audit quarterly by
     Owner, its representatives, any mortgagee of the Property, and such
     mortgagee's representative.  On or before thirty (30) days after the
     close of each quarter, U-Haul shall cause to be prepared and delivered
     to Owner, a monthly statement of receipts, expenses and charges, together
     with a statement of the disbursements made by U-Haul during such period
     on Owner's behalf.

          (i) [Reserved].

          (j) COLLECTION.  U-Haul shall be responsible for the billing and
     collection of all accounts receivable and for payment of all accounts
     payable with respect to the Property and shall be responsible for
<PAGE>
     establishing policies and procedures to minimize the amount of bad
     debts.

          (k) LEGAL ACTIONS.  U-Haul shall cause to be instituted, on
     behalf and in the name of Owner, any and all legal actions or
     proceedings U-Haul deems necessary or advisable to collect charges,
     rent or other income due to Owner with respect to the Property and to
     oust or dispossess tenants or other persons unlawfully in possession
     under any lease, license concession agreement or otherwise, and to
     collect damages for breach thereof or default thereunder by such
     tenant, licensee, concessionaire or occupant.

          (l) INSURANCE.  U-Haul shall use its best efforts to assure that
     there is obtained and maintained in force, fire, comprehensive
     liability and other insurance policies in amounts generally carried
     with respect to similar facilities. U-Haul may in its discretion
     obtain employee theft or similar insurance in amounts and with such
     deductibles as U-Haul deems appropriate.  U-Haul shall promptly
     provide Owner with such certificates of insurance as Owner may
     reasonably request in writing, evidencing such insurance coverage.

          (m) TAXES.  During the term of this Agreement, U-Haul shall pay
     from Owner's funds, prior to delinquency, all real estate taxes,
     personal property taxes, and all other taxes assessed to, or levied
     upon, the Property.  If required by the holder of any note secured by
     the Property, U-Haul will set aside, from Owner's funds, a reserve
     from each month's rent and other income collected, in an amount
     required by said holder for purposes of payment of real property
     taxes.

          (n) [RESERVED].

          (o) LIMITATIONS ON U-HAUL AUTHORITY.  Notwithstanding anything
     to the contrary set forth in this Section 2, U-Haul shall not,
     without obtaining the prior written consent of Owner, (i) rent
     storage space in the Property by written lease or agreement for a
     stated term in excess of one year, (ii) alter the building or other
     structures of the Property in any material manner; (iii) make any
     other agreements which exceed a term of one year and are not
     terminable on thirty day's notice at the will of Owner, without
     penalty, payment or surcharge; (iv) act in violation of any law; or
     (v) act in violation of any duty or responsibility of Owner under any
     mortgage loan secured by the Property.

          (p) SHARED EXPENSES.  Owner acknowledges that certain economies
     may be achieved with respect to certain expenses to be incurred by
     U-Haul on behalf of Owner hereunder if materials, supplies, insurance
     or services are purchased by U-Haul in quantity for use not only in
     connection with the Property but in connection with other properties
     owned or managed by U-Haul or its affiliates.  U-Haul shall have the
     right to purchase such materials, supplies, insurance and/or services
     in its own name and charge Owner a pro rata allocable share of the
<PAGE>
     cost of the foregoing; provided, however, that the pro rata cost of
     such purchase to Owner shall not result in expenses greater than
     would otherwise be incurred at competitive prices and terms available
     in the area where the Property is located; and provided further,
     U-Haul shall give Owner access to records so Owner may review any such
     expenses incurred.

          (q)  DEPOSIT OF GROSS REVENUES. All Gross Revenues (as
     hereinafter defined) shall be deposited into a trust bank account
     maintained by U-Haul (or its parent company) as trustee for the
     benefit of the Owner.  To the extent that the Gross Revenues are
     deposited into a collective trust account maintained by U-Haul (or
     its parent company) for the benefit of multiple property owners, such
     trust account will clearly identify the beneficiaries and U-Haul (or
     its parent company) shall reconcile such account daily and maintain
     such records as shall clearly identify each day the respective
     interest of each beneficiary in such collective trust account.  Gross
     Revenues of the Owner shall be applied first to the repayment of
     Owner's senior debt with respect to the Property, and then to U-Haul
     in reimbursement of expenses and for management fees as provided
     under Section 4 below.

     3.  Duties of Owner.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to cooperate with U-Haul in the performance
     of U-Haul's duties under this Agreement and to that end, upon the
     request of U-Haul, to provide, at such rental charges, if any, as are
     deemed appropriate, reasonable office space for U-Haul employees on
     the premises of the Property and to give U-Haul access to all files,
     books and records of Owner relevant to the Property.  Owner shall not
     unreasonably withhold or delay any consent or authorization to U-Haul
     required or appropriate under this Agreement.

     4.  Compensation of U-Haul.
         ----------------------

          (a)  MANAGEMEHT FEE. Owner shall pay to U-Haul as the full
     amount due for the services herein provided a fee (the "Management
     Fee") equal to six percent (6%) of the "Gross Revenue" derived from
     or connected with the Property so managed by U-Haul hereunder.  The
     term "Gross Revenue" shall mean all receipts (excluding security
     deposits unless and until Owner recognizes the same as income) of
     Owner (whether or not received by U-Haul on behalf or for the account
     of Owner) arising from the operation of the Property, including
     without limitation, rental payments of lessees of space in the
     Property, vending machine or concessionaire revenues, maintenance
     charges, if any, paid by the tenants of the Property in addition to
     basic rent, parking fees, if any, and all monies whether or not
     otherwise described herein paid for the use of the Property.  "Gross
     Revenue" shall be determined on a cash basis.  The Management Fee
     shall be paid promptly at the end of each calendar quarter and shall
     be calculated on the basis of the "Gross Revenue" of such preceding
<PAGE>
     quarter.  The Management Fee shall be paid to each U-Haul property
     manager herein identified based on the Gross Revenue of each
     respective Property for which such property manager is responsible as
     set forth on Exhibit A hereto.  Each property manager agrees that its
                  ---------
     monthly Management Fee shall be subordinate to that month's principal
     balance and interest payment on any first lien position mortgage loan
     on the Property.

          It is understood and agreed that the Management Fee will not be
     reduced by the cost to Owner of those employees and independent
     contractors engaged by or for Owner, including but not limited to the
     categories of personnel specifically referred to in Section 2(d).
     Except as provided in this Section 4, it is further understood and
     agreed that U-Haul shall not be entitled to additional compensation
     of any kind in connection with the performance by it of its duties
     under this Agreement.

          (b)  REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES.  In addition to the
     Management Fee described above, U-Haul shall be entitled to
     reimbursement from Owner, on a quarterly basis, for all out-of-pocket
     expenses incurred by U-Haul hereunder in connection with the
     management and operation of the Property, including, without
     limitation, taxes, insurance, operational expenses, overhead,
     litigation and dispute resolution related expenses, capital
     improvement expenses, and costs of sales.

     5.  Use of Trademarks, Service Marks and Related Items.
         --------------------------------------------------

          Owner acknowledges the significant value of the "U-Haul" name in
     the operations of Owner's property and it is therefore understood and
     agreed that the name,  trademark and service mark, "U-Haul", and
     related marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other trade or
     service items shall be utilized for the non-exclusive benefit of
     Owner in the rental and operation of the Property, and in comparable
     operations elsewhere.  It is further understood and agreed that this
     name and all such marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other
     trade or service items shall remain and be at all times the property
     of U-Haul and its affiliates, and that, except during the term hereof
     and as expressly provided herein, Owner shall have no right
     whatsoever therein.  Owner agrees that during the term of this
     agreement the sign faces at the property will have the name "U-Haul."
     The U-Haul sign faces will be paid for by Owner.  Upon termination of
     this agreement at any time for any reason, all such use by and for
     the benefit of Owner of any such name, mark, slogan, caricature,
     design or other trade or service item in connection with the Property
     shall, in any event, be terminated and any signs bearing any of the
     foregoing shall be removed from view and no longer used by Owner.  In
     addition, upon termination of this Agreement at any time for any
     reason, Owner shall not enter into any new leases of Property using
     the U-Haul lease form or use other forms prepared by U-Haul.  It is
     understood and agreed that U-Haul will use and shall be unrestricted
     in its use of such name, mark, slogan, caricature, design or other
     trade or service item in the management and operation of other
<PAGE>
     storage facilities both during and after the expiration or
     termination of the term of this Agreement.

     6.  Termination.
         -----------

          Owner or U-Haul may terminate this Agreement with or without
     cause by giving not less than thirty days' written notice to the
     other party pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  In addition, if Owner
     fails to pay U-Haul any amounts owed under this Agreement when due,
     U-Haul may terminate this Agreement by giving Owner not less than ten
     days written notice pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, however, U-Haul shall not resign as property manager
     of the Property until a nationally recognized and reputable successor
     property manager is available and prepared to assume property
     management responsibilities with respect to the Property in question
     Upon termination of this Agreement, U-Haul shall promptly return to
     Owner all monies, books, records and other materials held by U-Haul
     for or on behalf of Owner.  In addition, if U-Haul has contracted to
     advertise the Property in the Yellow Pages, Owner shall, at the
     option of U-Haul, continue to be responsible for the cost of such
     advertisement and shall either (i) pay U-Haul the remaining amount
     due under such contract in a lump sum; or (ii) pay U-Haul monthly for
     the amount due under such contract.

     7.  Indemnification.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of U-Haul, all
     persons and companies affiliated with U-Haul, and all officers,
     shareholders, directors, employees and agents of U-Haul and of any
     affiliated companies or persons (collectively, the "Indemnified
     Persons") harmless from any and all costs, expenses, attorneys' fees,
     suits, liabilities, judgments, damages, and claims in connection with
     the management of the Property (including the loss of use thereof
     following any damage, injury or destruction), arising from any cause
     except for the willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of
     the Indemnified Persons.  In addition, no Indemnified Person shall be
     liable for any error of judgment or for any mistake of fact or law,
     or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing hereafter,
     except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.  U-Haul
     hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Owner harmless from any and all
     costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, suits, liabilities, judgments,
     damages and claims in connection with the management of the Property
     arising from the willful misconduct of, gross negligence of, or
     breach of this Agreement by the Indemnified Persons.  In addition,
     U-Haul shall not be liable to Owner for the acts or omissions of
     U-Haul's officers, shareholders, directors, employees, and agents
     except for U-Haul's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
<PAGE>

     8.  Assignment.
         ----------

          This Agreement may be assigned by Owner in connection with any
     mortgage loan on the Property, whether pursuant to a conditional or
     unconditional, absolute assignment.  U-Haul shall have the right to
     assign this Agreement to an affiliate or a wholly or majority owned
     subsidiary; provided, however, any such assignee must assume all
     obligations of U-Haul hereunder, Owner's rights hereunder will be
     enforceable against any such assignee and U-Haul shall not be
     released from its liabilities hereunder unless Owner shall expressly
     agree thereto in writing.

     15.  Counterparts.
          ------------

          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
     of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
     constitute one and the same instrument.

     16.  Scope of Property Manager Responsibility.
          ----------------------------------------

          The duties, obligations and liability of each property manager
     identified herein shall extend only so far as to relate to the
     Property for which such property manager is managing located in the
     domicile state of such property manager, as more specifically
     described on Exhibit A hereto, and no individual property manager
     hereunder shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any other
     property manager hereunder.  Each property manager shall use its best
     efforts to assist Owner in fulfilling Owner's obligations arising
     under any loan to Owner that is secured by the Property, including
     but not limited to preparing and providing financial and accounting
     reports, and maintaining the Property.  Each property manager agrees
     that it will perform its obligations hereunder according to
     reasonable industry standards, in good faith, and in a commercially
     reasonable manner.  U-Haul agrees that, in discharging its duties
     hereunder, it will not have any relationship with any of its
     affiliates that would be less favorable to Owner than would
     reasonably be available in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.

     of the date first above written.

     respectively referred to herein as "U-Haul").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

     contained, Owner and U-Haul hereby agree as follows.

     1.  Employment.
         ----------

          (a) Owner hereby retains U-Haul, and U-Haul agrees to act as
     manager of the Property upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set
     forth.

          (b) Owner acknowledges that U-Haul, and/or U-Haul affiliates, is

     account and for the account of others.  It is hereby expressly agreed
     that notwithstanding this Agreement, U-Haul and such affiliates may
     continue to engage in such activities, may manage facilities other
     than those presently managed by U-Haul and its affiliates (whether or
     not such other facilities may be in direct or indirect competition
     with Owner) and may in the future engage in other business which may
     compete directly or indirectly with activities of Owner.

          (c) In the performance of their respective duties under this
     Agreement, each U-Haul property manager shall occupy the position of
     an independent contractor with respect to Owner.  Nothing contained
     herein shall be construed as making the parties hereto (or any of
     them) partners or joint venturors, nor (except as expressly otherwise
<PAGE>
     provided for herein) construed as making U-Haul an agent or employee
     of Owner or of any other U-Haul property manager hereunder.

     2.  Duties and Authority of U-Haul.
         ------------------------------

          (a) GENERAL DUTIES AND AUTHORITY.  Subject only to the
     restrictions and limitations provided in paragraphs (o) and (p) of
     this Section 2  and the right of Owner to terminate this Agreement as
     provided in Section 6 hereof, U-Haul shall have the sole and
     exclusive authority to fully manage the Property and supervise and
     direct the business and affairs associated or related to the daily
     operation thereof, and, to that end on behalf of Owner, to execute
     such documents and instruments as, in the sole judgment of U-Haul,
     are reasonably necessary or advisable under the circumstances in
     order to fulfill U-Haul's duties hereunder.  Such duties and
     authority shall include, without limitation, those set forth below.

          (b) RENTING OF THE PROPERTY.  U-Haul shall establish policies
     and procedures for the marketing activities for the Property, and may
     advertise the Property through such media as U-Haul deems advisable,
     including, without limitation, advertising with the Yellow Pages.
     U-Haul shall have the sole discretion, which discretion shall be
     exercised in good faith, to establish the terms and conditions of
     occupancy by the tenants of the Property, and U-Haul is hereby
     authorized to enter into rental agreements on behalf and for the
     account of Owner with such tenants and to collect rent from such
     tenants. U-Haul may jointly advertise the Property with other
     properties owned or managed by U-Haul, and in that event, U-Haul
     shall reasonably allocate the cost of such advertising among such
     properties.

          (c) REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS.  U-Haul shall make,
     execute, supervise and have control over the making and executing of
     all decisions concerning the acquisition of furniture, fixtures and
     supplies for the Property, and may purchase, lease or otherwise
     acquire the same on behalf of Owner.  U-Haul shall make and execute,
     or supervise and have control over the making and executing of all
     decisions concerning the maintenance, repair, and landscaping of the
     Property. U-Haul shall, on behalf of Owner, negotiate and contract
     for and supervise the installation of all capital improvements
     related to the Property; provided, however, that U-Haul agrees to
     secure the prior written approval of Owner on all such expenditures
     in excess of $5,000.00 for any one item, except monthly or recurring
     operating charges and/or emergency repairs if in the opinion of
     U-Haul such emergency-related expenditures are necessary to protect the
     Property from damage or to maintain services to the tenants as called
     for in their respective leases.

          (d) PERSONNEL.  U-Haul shall select all vendors, suppliers,
     contractors, subcontractors and employees with respect to the
     Property and shall hire, discharge and supervise all labor and
     employees required for the operation and maintenance of the Property.
     Any employees so hired shall be employees of U-Haul, and shall be
<PAGE>
     carried on the payroll of U-Haul.  Employees may include, but will
     not be limited to, on-site resident managers, on-site assistant
     managers, and relief managers located, rendering services, or
     performing activities on the Property in connection with its
     operation and management.  The cost of employing such persons shall
     not exceed prevailing rates for comparable persons performing the
     same or similar services with respect to real estate similar to the
     Property.

          (e) AGREEMENTS.  U-Haul shall negotiate and execute on behalf of
     Owner such agreements which U-Haul deems necessary or advisable for
     the furnishing of utilities, services, concessions and supplies, for
     the maintenance, repair and operation of the Property and such other
     agreements which may benefit the Property or be incidental to the
     matters for which U-Haul is responsible hereunder.

          (f) OTHER DECISIONS.  U-Haul shall make all decisions in
     connection with the daily operation of the Property.

          (g) REGULATIONS AND PERMITS.  U-Haul shall comply in all
     material respects with any statute, ordinance, law, rule, regulation
     or order of any governmental or regulatory body, having jurisdiction
     over the Property, respecting the use of the Property or the
     maintenance or operation thereof.  U-Haul shall apply for and attempt
     to obtain and maintain, on behalf of Owner, all licenses and permits
     required or advisable (in the sole judgment of U-Haul) in connection
     with the management and operation of the Property.

          (h) RECORDS AND REPORTS OF DISBURSEMENTS AND COLLECTIONS.
     U-Haul shall establish, supervise, direct and maintain the operation
     of a system of record keeping and bookkeeping with respect to all
     receipts and disbursements in connection with the management and
     operation of the Property.  The books, records and accounts shall be
     maintained at the U-Haul office or at such other location as U-Haul
     shall determine, and shall be available and open to examination and
     audit quarterly by Owner, its representatives, any mortgagee of the
     Property, and such mortgagee's representative.  On or before thirty
     (30) days after the close of each quarter, U-Haul shall cause to be
     prepared and delivered to Owner, a monthly statement of receipts,
     expenses and charges, together with a statement of the disbursements
     made by U-Haul during such period on Owner's behalf.

          (i) [Reserved].

          (j) COLLECTION.  U-Haul shall be responsible for the billing and
     collection of all accounts receivable and for payment of all accounts
     payable with respect to the Property and shall be responsible for
     establishing policies and procedures to minimize the amount of bad
     debts.
<PAGE>
          (k) LEGAL ACTIONS.  U-Haul shall cause to be instituted, on
     behalf and in the name of Owner, any and all legal actions or
     proceedings U-Haul deems necessary or advisable to collect charges,
     rent or other income due to Owner with respect to the Property and to
     oust or dispossess tenants or other persons unlawfully in possession
     under any lease, license concession agreement or otherwise, and to
     collect damages for breach thereof or default thereunder by such
     tenant, licensee, concessionaire or occupant.

          (l) INSURANCE.  U-Haul shall use its best efforts to assure that
     there is obtained and maintained in force, fire, comprehensive
     liability and other insurance policies in amounts generally carried
     with respect to similar facilities. U-Haul may in its discretion
     obtain employee theft or similar insurance in amounts and with such
     deductibles as U-Haul deems appropriate.  U-Haul shall promptly
     provide Owner with such certificates of insurance as Owner may
     reasonably request in writing, evidencing such insurance coverage.

          (m) TAXES.  During the term of this Agreement, U-Haul shall pay
     from Owner's funds, prior to delinquency, all real estate taxes,
     personal property taxes, and all other taxes assessed to, or levied
     upon, the Property.  If required by the holder of any note secured by
     the Property, U-Haul will set aside, from Owner's funds, a reserve
     from each month's rent and other income collected, in an amount
     required by said holder for purposes of payment of real property
     taxes.

          (n) [RESERVED].

          (o) LIMITATIONS ON U-HAUL AUTHORITY.  Notwithstanding anything
     to the contrary set forth in this Section 2, U-Haul shall not,
     without obtaining the prior written consent of Owner, (i) rent
     storage space in the Property by written lease or agreement for a
     stated term in excess of one year, (ii) alter the building or other
     structures of the Property in any material manner; (iii) make any
     other agreements which exceed a term of one year and are not
     terminable on thirty day's notice at the will of Owner, without
     penalty, payment or surcharge; (iv) act in violation of any law; or
     (v) act in violation of any duty or responsibility of Owner under any
     mortgage loan secured by the Property.

          (p) SHARED EXPENSES.  Owner acknowledges that certain economies
     may be achieved with respect to certain expenses to be incurred by
     U-Haul on behalf of Owner hereunder if materials, supplies, insurance
     or services are purchased by U-Haul in quantity for use not only in
     connection with the Property but in connection with other properties
     owned or managed by U-Haul or its affiliates.  U-Haul shall have the
     right to purchase such materials, supplies, insurance and/or services
     in its own name and charge Owner a pro rata allocable share of the
     cost of the foregoing; provided, however, that the pro rata cost of
     such purchase to Owner shall not result in expenses greater than
     would otherwise be incurred at competitive prices and terms available
<PAGE>
     in the area where the Property is located; and provided further,
     U-Haul shall give Owner access to records so Owner may review any such
     expenses incurred.

          (q)  DEPOSIT OF GROSS REVENUES. All Gross Revenues (as
     hereinafter defined) shall be deposited into a trust bank account
     maintained by U-Haul (or its parent company) as trustee for the
     benefit of the Owner.  To the extent that the Gross Revenues are
     deposited into a collective trust account maintained by U-Haul (or
     its parent company) for the benefit of multiple property owners, such
     trust account will clearly identify the beneficiaries and U-Haul (or
     its parent company) shall reconcile such account daily and maintain
     such records as shall clearly identify each day the respective
     interest of each beneficiary in such collective trust account.  Gross
     Revenues of the Owner shall be applied first to the repayment of
     Owner's senior debt with respect to the Property, and then to U-Haul
     in reimbursement of expenses and for management fees as provided
     under Section 4 below.

     3.  Duties of Owner.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to cooperate with U-Haul in the performance
     of U-Haul's duties under this Agreement and to that end, upon the
     request of U-Haul, to provide, at such rental charges, if any, as are
     deemed appropriate, reasonable office space for U-Haul employees on
     the premises of the Property and to give U-Haul access to all files,
     books and records of Owner relevant to the Property.  Owner shall not
     unreasonably withhold or delay any consent or authorization to U-Haul
     required or appropriate under this Agreement.

     4.  Compensation of U-Haul.
         ----------------------

          (a)  MANAGEMENT FEE. Owner shall pay to U-Haul as the full
     amount due for the services herein provided a fee (the "Management
     Fee") equal to six percent (6%) of the "Gross Revenue" derived from
     or connected with the Property so managed by U-Haul hereunder.  The
     term "Gross Revenue" shall mean all receipts (excluding security
     deposits unless and until Owner recognizes the same as income) of
     Owner (whether or not received by U-Haul on behalf or for the account
     of Owner) arising from the operation of the Property, including
     without limitation, rental payments of lessees of space in the
     Property, vending machine or concessionaire revenues, maintenance
     charges, if any, paid by the tenants of the Property in addition to
     basic rent, parking fees, if any, and all monies whether or not
     otherwise described herein paid for the use of the Property.  "Gross
     Revenue" shall be determined on a cash basis.  The Management Fee
     shall be paid promptly at the end of each calendar quarter and shall
     be calculated on the basis of the "Gross Revenue" of such preceding
     quarter.  The Management Fee shall be paid to each U-Haul property
     manager herein identified based on the Gross Revenue of each
     respective Property for which such property manager is responsible as
     set forth on Exhibit A hereto.  Each property manager agrees that its
                  ---------
<PAGE>
     monthly Management Fee shall be subordinate to that month's principal
     balance and interest payment on any first lien position mortgage loan
     on the Property.

          It is understood and agreed that the Management Fee will not be
     reduced by the cost to Owner of those employees and independent
     contractors engaged by or for Owner, including but not limited to the
     categories of personnel specifically referred to in Section 2(d).
     Except as provided in this Section 4, it is further understood and
     agreed that U-Haul shall not be entitled to additional compensation
     of any kind in connection with the performance by it of its duties
     under this Agreement.

          (b)  REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES.  In addition to the
     Management Fee described above, U-Haul shall be entitled to
     reimbursement from Owner, on a quarterly basis, for all out-of-pocket
     expenses incurred by U-Haul hereunder in connection with the
     management and operation of the Property, including, without
     limitation, taxes, insurance, operational expenses, overhead,
     litigation and dispute resolution related expenses, capital
     improvement expenses, and costs of sales.

     5.  Use of Trademarks, Service Marks and Related Items.
         --------------------------------------------------

          Owner acknowledges the significant value of the "U-Haul" name in
     the operations of Owner's property and it is therefore understood and
     agreed that the name,  trademark and service mark, "U-Haul", and
     related marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other trade or
     service items shall be utilized for the non-exclusive benefit of
     Owner in the rental and operation of the Property, and in comparable
     operations elsewhere.  It is further understood and agreed that this
     name and all such marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other
     trade or service items shall remain and be at all times the property
     of U-Haul and its affiliates, and that, except during the term hereof
     and as expressly provided herein, Owner shall have no right
     whatsoever therein.  Owner agrees that during the term of this
     agreement the sign faces at the property will have the name "U-Haul."
     The U-Haul sign faces will be paid for by Owner.  Upon termination of
     this agreement at any time for any reason, all such use by and for
     the benefit of Owner of any such name, mark, slogan, caricature,
     design or other trade or service item in connection with the Property
     shall, in any event, be terminated and any signs bearing any of the
     foregoing shall be removed from view and no longer used by Owner.  In
     addition, upon termination of this Agreement at any time for any
     reason, Owner shall not enter into any new leases of Property using
     the U-Haul lease form or use other forms prepared by U-Haul.  It is
     understood and agreed that U-Haul will use and shall be unrestricted
     in its use of such name, mark, slogan, caricature, design or other
     trade or service item in the management and operation of other
     storage facilities both during and after the expiration or
     termination of the term of this Agreement.

     6.  Termination.
         -----------
<PAGE>
          Owner or U-Haul may terminate this Agreement with or without
     cause by giving not less than thirty days' written notice to the
     other party pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  In addition, if Owner
     fails to pay U-Haul any amounts owed under this Agreement when due,
     U-Haul may terminate this Agreement by giving Owner not less than ten
     days written notice pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, however, U-Haul shall not resign as property manager
     of the Property until a nationally recognized and reputable successor
     property manager is available and prepared to assume property
     management responsibilities with respect to the Property in question
     Upon termination of this Agreement, U-Haul shall promptly return to
     Owner all monies, books, records and other materials held by U-Haul
     for or on behalf of Owner.  In addition, if U-Haul has contracted to
     advertise the Property in the Yellow Pages, Owner shall, at the
     option of U-Haul, continue to be responsible for the cost of such
     advertisement and shall either (i) pay U-Haul the remaining amount
     due under such contract in a lump sum; or (ii) pay U-Haul monthly for
     the amount due under such contract.

     7.  Indemnification.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of U-Haul, all
     persons and companies affiliated with U-Haul, and all officers,
     shareholders, directors, employees and agents of U-Haul and of any
     affiliated companies or persons (collectively, the "Indemnified
     Persons") harmless from any and all costs, expenses, attorneys' fees,
     suits, liabilities, judgments, damages, and claims in connection with
     the management of the Property (including the loss of use thereof
     following any damage, injury or destruction), arising from any cause
     except for the willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of
     the Indemnified Persons.  In addition, no Indemnified Person shall be
     liable for any error of judgment or for any mistake of fact or law,
     or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing hereafter,
     except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.  U-Haul
     hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Owner harmless from any and all
     costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, suits, liabilities, judgments,
     damages and claims in connection with the management of the Property
     arising from the willful misconduct of, gross negligence of, or
     breach of this Agreement by the Indemnified Persons.  In addition,
     U-Haul shall not be liable to Owner for the acts or omissions of
     U-Haul's officers, shareholders, directors, employees, and agents
     except for U-Haul's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
<PAGE>
     8.  Assignment.
         ----------

          This Agreement may be assigned by Owner in connection with any
     mortgage loan on the Property, whether pursuant to a conditional or
     unconditional, absolute assignment.  U-Haul shall have the right to
     assign this Agreement to an affiliate or a wholly or majority owned
     subsidiary; provided, however, any such assignee must assume all
     obligations of U-Haul hereunder, Owner's rights hereunder will be
     enforceable against any such assignee and U-Haul shall not be
     released from its liabilities hereunder unless Owner shall expressly
     agree thereto in writing.

     9.  Headings.
         --------

          The headings contained herein are for convenience of reference
     only and are not intended to define, limit or describe the scope or
     intent of any provision of this Agreement.

     10.  Governing Law.
          -------------

          The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms
     and the interpretation of the rights and duties of the parties shall
     be governed by the internal laws of the State of Arizona.

     11.  Notices.
          -------

          Any notice required or permitted herein shall be in writing and
     shall be personally delivered or mailed first class postage prepaid
     or delivered by an overnight delivery service to the respective
     addresses of the parties set forth below their signatures on the
     signature page thereof, or to such other address as any party may

     deposit in the first class mail.

     12.  Severability.
          ------------

          Should any term or provision hereof be deemed invalid, void or
     unenforceable either in its entirety or in a particular application,
     the remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full
     force and effect and, if the subject term or provision is deemed to
     be invalid, void or unenforceable only with respect to a particular
     application, such term or provision shall remain in full force and
     effect with respect to all other applications.
<PAGE>
     13.  Successors.
          ----------

          This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
     the respective parties hereto and their permitted assigns and
     successors in interest.

     14.  Attorneys' Fees.
          ---------------

          If it shall become necessary for any party hereto to engage
     attorneys to institute legal action for the purpose of enforcing
     their respective rights hereunder or for the purpose of defending
     legal action brought by the other party hereto, the party or parties
     prevailing in such litigation shall be entitled to receive all costs,
     expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
     it in such litigation (including appeals).

     15.  Counterparts.
          ------------

          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
     of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
     constitute one and the same instrument.

     16.  Scope of Property Manager Responsibility.
          ----------------------------------------

          The duties, obligations and liability of each property manager
     identified herein shall extend only so far as to relate to the
     Property for which such property manager is managing located in the
     domicile state of such property manager, as more specifically
     described on Exhibit A hereto, and no individual property manager
     hereunder shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any other
     property manager hereunder.  Each property manager shall use its best
     efforts to assist Owner in fulfilling Owner's obligations arising
     under any loan to Owner that is secured by the Property, including
     but not limited to preparing and providing financial and accounting
     reports, and maintaining the Property.  Each property manager agrees
     that it will perform its obligations hereunder according to
     reasonable industry standards, in good faith, and in a commercially
     reasonable manner.  U-Haul agrees that, in discharging its duties
     hereunder, it will not have any relationship with any of its
     affiliates that would be less favorable to Owner than would
     reasonably be available in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.
