       NOTES   TO   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS   (UNAUDITED)

1.  The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three month and six
month periods ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 were not audited.  However, in
Management's opinion, the information reflects all adjustments necessary for a
fair statement of the results for the periods presented.  Management believes
all adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the
1998 audited financial statements in Bethlehem's Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

3.  On May 29, 1998, Bethlehem acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Lukens Inc.  The aggregate purchase price of $560.6 million comprises cash of
$327.8 million, the issuance of 15.1 million shares of Bethlehem common stock
valued at $184.8 million, and transaction related costs of $48.0 million.
Bethlehem paid $6.6 million of the transaction related costs during the first
six months of 1999.  The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, Lukens' results are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements from the date of acquisition.

    The fair value (in millions) of the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed is as follows:

     Current assets                                        $ 187.8
     Property, plant and equipment                           265.1
     Net assets of discontinued stainless opertions          310.0
     Deferred tax asset, other                                75.4
     Goodwill                                                360.0
     Current liabilities                                    (105.0)
     Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities   (230.0)
     Debt                                                   (268.5)
     Other long-term liabilities                             (34.2)
                                                           --------
     Purchase price, net of cash acquired                  $ 560.6
                                                           ========

    In February 1999, Bethlehem completed the sale of the stainless
distribution business, Washington Specialty Metals Corporation for about $70
million.  In April 1999, Bethlehem signed an agreement to sell the stainless
sheet operations in Massillon, Ohio and Washington, Pennsylvania.  Negotiations
continue and are contingent on the prospective owner reaching a labor agreement
with the USWA.  The stainless and distribution businesses were acquired with
the purchase of Lukens Inc.  and are being accounted for as discontinued
operations.  Income or losses from these operations are not included in
Bethlehem's operating results.  Since the date of acquisition, these operations
have incurred operating losses of about $33 million.  The net assets of these
operations are shown separately on the balance sheet and consist primarily of
property, plant and equipment and working capital.

    Bethlehem will finalize all purchase accounting adjustments upon completion
of the sale of the stainless sheet operations described above.  Any future
adjustments are not expected to materially affect the recorded values of the
assets acquired or liabilities assumed, including the recorded amount of
goodwill.

    The unaudited pro forma combined results (excluding stainless) for the
first six months of 1998 as if Lukens had been acquired at the beginning of
1998 are estimated to be (dollars in millions, except per share data):

        Net Sales                 $ 2,561.9
        Income from Operations        154.5
        Net Income                    107.3

        Net Income per Share:
        Basic                     $     .68
        Diluted                         .67


4.  On April 23, 1999 Bethlehem entered into a construction financing
arrangement for the coversion of a continuous slab casting strand at Sparrows
Point to a wide slab casting strand.  The financing is for a maximum of $50
million with an interest rate of about 8% and a term of 16 months.  As of June
30, 1999, Bethlehem had borrowed about $11 million under the financing.  On
July 21, 1999, Bethlehem entered into a loan arrangement for $60 million at an
interest rate of about 7-1/4% and a term of 18 months to finance a portion of
the cold rolling complex at Sparrows Point.  Bethlehem will replace these
construction financings with permanent financings upon the completion of the
projects.

    On June 17, 1999, Bethlehem amended its existing non-reducing credit
facility.  The amendment increases the size of the facility from $600 million
to $660 million by increasing the inventory credit agreement from $260 million
to $320 million.  The size of the receivables purchase agreement remains at
$340 million and the maturity of the facility remains June 19, 2003.

                          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
           ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


REVIEW OF RESULTS:

SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1999
SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1998

         We reported a net loss of $30 million (($.31) per diluted share) for
the second quarter of 1999 compared with net income of $38 million ($.23 per
diluted share) for the second quarter of 1998.  Results for the second quarter
of 1999 include about $20 million ($17 million after-tax) of additional
operating costs that were incurred in connection with the reline of our blast
furnace at Sparrows Point.  Results for the second quarter of 1998 include a
$35 million ($29 million after-tax) estimated loss related to the closing
of our Sparrows Point plate mill.  Excluding this item, net income for the
second quarter of 1998 would have been $67 million ($.45 per diluted share).
Sales for the second quarter of 1999 were $985 million compared with $1.19
billion for the second quarter of 1998.


OPERATING RESULTS

         Our loss from operations was $26 million for the second quarter of
1999 compared with income from operations of $89 million (excluding the $35
million estimated loss) for the second quarter of 1998.  Second quarter
1999 operating results declined from a year ago due to significantly lower
realized prices and lower shipments, and the approximately $20 million of
higher operating costs that were incurred in connection with the reline of our
"L" blast furnace at Sparrows Point.  Blast furnace production was discontinued
on June 5 and is expected to resume in mid August 1999.

         Steel shipments of about 2.1 million net tons for the second quarter
of 1999 were less than the 2.4 million net tons shipped in the second quarter
of 1998 as lower shipments at Burns Harbor, Sparrows Point, and Pennsylvania
Steel Technologies, Inc. more than offset additional plate shipments
resulting from our acquisition of Lukens in May 1998.

         Our loss from operations for the first six months of 1999 was $46
million compared with income from operations of $179 million (excluding the
estimated loss) for the first six months of 1998.  Results declined
primarily due to significantly lower realized prices and lower shipments.

         Second quarter 1999 operating results were slightly worse than the $20
million loss experienced in the first quarter of 1999.  This was primarily due
to lower realized prices, especially for plate products.  This adverse effect
of lower realized prices was partially offset by increased shipments and lower
costs, primarily for raw materials, despite the

                                     - 6 -

additional costs that were incurred in connection with the blast furnace reline
at Sparrows Point.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

         At June 30, 1999, total liquidity, comprising cash, cash equivalents,
and funds available under our bank credit arrangements, totaled $405 million
compared with $479 million at December 31, 1998 and $602 million at June 30,
1998.

         For the first six months of 1999, cash provided from operations before
pension activities was $99 million, including the sale of $70 million of
receivables, compared with $267 million for the first six months of 1998.
Principal uses of cash during the first six months of 1999 included capital
expenditures of $227 million, debt repayments of $24 million, and pension
funding of $20 million.

         Capital expenditures and investments are currently expected to be
about $550 million in 1999.  Major capital expenditures for 1999 include the
previously announced construction of a new continuous cold mill complex, reline
of the "L" blast furnace, and conversion of a continuous slab casting strand to
a wide slab casting strand at Sparrows Point.  It also includes construction
and other spending related to a hot dip coating line joint venture with LTV
that was previously announced.  We recently began preliminary work on the
caster conversion at Sparrows Point to coincide with the reline of the blast
furnace to minimize production losses during the final stages of the conversion
scheduled for second quarter 2000.  We are also using the opportunity of the
current production outage related to the blast furnace reline to complete
various other modernization projects at Sparrows Point that will enhance the
division's competitiveness.

         In addition to capital expenditures, other major uses of cash during
the year are expected to include debt repayments and pension funding.

         We expect to maintain an adequate level of liquidity during 1999 with
cash provided from operations, reductions in working capital, asset sales,
project financings, and available funds under our credit arrangements.

         In June, we increased the size of our non-reducing credit arrangement
from $600 million to $660 million by increasing the inventory credit agreement
from $260 million to $320 million.  The size of the receivables purchase
agreement remains at $340 million, and the maturity date of the arrangement
remains June 19, 2003.  Two banks were added to our bank group, increasing the
total to 15 domestic and international institutions.

         During the second half of this year, we anticipate that our working
capital will be reduced by about $150 million, primarily from lower
inventories.  As previously reported, we also expect to complete certain agreed
upon improvements that will enhance the performance of the facilities at
Bethlehem Lukens Plate that will be used to provide conversion services to
Allegheny Teledyne and to receive payment from them for a $70

                                     - 7 -

million note which will then be payable.

         With respect to financings, in April, we entered into a $50 million
construction financing arrangement for the wide slab casting strand project at
Sparrows Point.  We will replace the construction financing with a permanent
financing upon the completion of the project in the third quarter of 2000.
Additionally, in July we entered into a $60 million short- term loan
arrangement with RZB Finance, LLC relating to a portion of our cold mill
capital expenditures at Sparrows Point.  We are also working jointly with LTV
to arrange both construction and permanent financing for the hot dip coating
line joint venture, which we expect to complete in the third quarter of this
year.


INTERNATIONAL STEEL TRADE

         The steel trade crisis continues to adversely affect our performance.
Shipments have been reduced and prices depressed.  Average domestic steel
industry prices for all products in 1999 are down 7% from average 1998 prices.
This is the largest aggregate decline in nearly 20 years.  Current industry
market prices for hot rolled, cold rolled, and plate have declined 10%, 9%, and
15%, respectively, from a year ago.

         We will continue to take all appropriate legal actions and have
pending hot rolled, cold rolled, and plate cases.  Our public affairs
activities are advancing with the Stand Up for Steel Campaign in coordination
with the USWA, other leading steel companies, and others.  Our government
affairs actions are centered on working closely with the Administration and the
Congress to bring about much needed trade law reform.  We believe that all of
these actions will in due course help to restore fair trade in steel.


LABOR CONTRACT

         Bethlehem and the USWA have reached a tentative labor agreement which
is subject to ratification by the USWA membership.  We believe the tentative
long-term, five-year, labor agreement is a fair and reasonable contract that
provides stability to our customers, suppliers, employees, and stockholders.
The new labor agreement will provide Bethlehem with a sound basis to advance
our objective of creating partnerships among employees, and to improve our
productivity and overall competitiveness.


YEAR 2000

         Problems created by the once common programming practice of storing
date information using only the last two digits to indicate the year will
impact all businesses and government organizations as we approach the year
2000.  The scope of our Year 2000 Program involves many areas including our
business and manufacturing computing systems, the associated personal
computing, communications and

                                           - 8 -





<PAGE> 10

infrastructure elements, and the Year 2000 readiness of our key suppliers and
customers.  The major elements of our program are inventory, risk assessment,
remediation, testing, and contingency planning.

         We have been actively working on resolving the Year 2000 problem
for over four years.  The effort was initiated with a large pilot project in
late 1994 during which five percent of our business applications were converted
to be Year 2000 compliant.  The pilot allowed us to develop a methodology for
solving our Year 2000 problem as well as a structure for effective management
and timely correction of the problem within our systems.  In late 1997, we
conducted a 45-day test of converted business applications for Business Unit
and Corporate systems as well as all operating system software in a full
simulation of the Year 2000.  We reset the system clock for various dates and
tested the processing of date information before and after December 31, 1999,
as well as processing of the Year 2000 as a leap year.  This test was completed
successfully and validated our processes and methods for addressing the Year
2000 problem.   Additional full-scale tests were conducted in December 1998,
January 1999, and March 1999.  The results of these additional tests were
positive and reinforced our approach for addressing the Year 2000 problem.

         We continue to evaluate the readiness of our key suppliers and
customers.  Starting in April 1998, we surveyed key suppliers, transportation
providers, financial partners, and electronic data interchange trading
partners.  To date, responses have been received from 95% of those surveyed and
we are currently confirming their compliance.  Additionally, we have received
correspondence from over 700 key customers regarding their Year 2000 readiness,
and we will continue to review their readiness.

         We have completed the Year 2000 remediation of all critical
functions.  We have replaced, repaired, or re-engineered all systems that could
significantly impact our ability to process orders, produce goods, provide
services, ensure product quality, and perform other critical functions.  Our
focus is now on contingency planning and the final testing and verification of
systems.  Year 2000 business continuity planning and contingency planning are
underway at all of our facilities and offices.  We have prioritized critical
business processes, developed probable and worst case failure scenarios,
assessed the business impact of these potential failures, and developed risk
management strategies to mitigate these risks.  Our risk management strategies
include operating, staffing, contingency, and triage plans.  Our plans address
both internal and external risks.  Strategies for mitigating risk include the
development of (1) operating and staffing plans for the Year 2000 rollover, (2)
backup and/or alternate procedures, and (3) inventory requirements based on
customer and supplier assessments.  We are developing alternate plans for those
business partners who may not be Year 2000 ready in significant areas and
preparing contact lists and plans for working with key business partners during
the rollover period to ensure a swift resolution to any problem.  We plan to
complete the contingency planning and remediate the few remaining non-critical
systems by the end of the third quarter.

         The costs associated with our Year 2000 Program continue to be at
planned levels.  The costs will be charged to normal operating expenses.  The
total estimated incremental cost of this activity is approximately $7 million.
We do not expect to incur any extraordinary charges associated with the effort,
and no major computer projects have been deferred because of our Year 2000
Program.

         We believe that we have taken all reasonable steps to ensure our
Year 2000 readiness.  The success of our Year 2000 program now depends, to a
large extent, on the Year 2000 readiness of our key business partners and, if
necessary, the implementation of contingency plans.  These and other
unanticipated Year 2000 issues could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition.


DIVIDENDS

         On July 28, 1999, our Board of Directors declared dividends of $1.25
per share on Bethlehem's $5.00 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.625
per share on Bethlehem's $2.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and
$0.875 per share on Bethlehem's $3.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,
each payable September 10, 1999, to holders of record on August 10, 1999.  No
dividend was declared on Bethlehem's Common Stock.


OUTLOOK

         The domestic economy continues on a course of moderate growth and
inflation remains relatively low.  Competition remains intense in all of our
markets due to unfairly traded imports, excess global steel capacity, new
domestic supply, and continuing high levels of plate inventories in the
marketplace.

         The reline of our "L" blast furnace at Sparrows Point is on schedule,
and we expect the furnace to resume production in mid August 1999.  The
reline had an adverse impact on our costs of about $20 million during the
second quarter and will also adversely affect costs in the third quarter by
about the same amount.  The tentative labor agreement reached with the USWA
will be voted on by August 6, 1999, and we hope that it will be ratified by the
membership.  Our automotive customers are currently in active negotiations with
their labor unions, and we also hope they will reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.

         While current business conditions remain difficult, we will continue
our strategy of concentrating on steel and rebuilding our financial strength,
and we are taking all necessary actions to reduce costs and improve our overall
competitiveness.
