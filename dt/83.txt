PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.


GENERAL

         AT&T Corp. was  incorporated in 1885 under the laws of the State of New
York and has its principal  executive offices at 32 Avenue of the Americas,  New
York, New York 10013-2412 (telephone number 212-387-5400).

         AT&T is among the world's communications leaders, providing voice, data
and video communications  services to large and small businesses,  consumers and
government   entities.   AT&T  and  its   subsidiaries   furnish   domestic  and
international  long  distance,   regional,  local  and  wireless  communications
services,  cable (broadband)  television and Internet  communications  services.
AT&T also provides billing,  directory, and calling card services to support its
communications business.

         AT&T's  primary  lines of  business  are  business  services;  consumer
services;  broadband services; and wireless services. In addition,  AT&T's other
lines of business include network  management and professional  services through
AT&T Solutions and international operations and ventures.

         Internet  users can access  information  about AT&T and its services at
www.att.com. Our web site is not a part of this Form 10-K.

         AT&T has four classes or series of common stock outstanding. Throughout
this document:

          o    AT&T  Wireless   Group  refers  to  the   business,   assets  and
               liabilities  whose  financial  performance  and economic value we
               intend to reflect in the AT&T Wireless Group Tracking Stock;

          o    Liberty   Media  Group  refers  to  the   business,   assets  and
               liabilities  whose  financial  performance  and economic value we
               intend to reflect in the Liberty Media Group tracking stock;

          o    AT&T,  the Company or the AT&T Common  Stock Group  refers to the
               business,  assets and liabilities whose financial performance and
               economic  value is not  reflected  in either of the two  tracking
               stocks and that we intend to reflect in the Common Stock; and

          o    AT&T Corp. refers to the combined legal entity.


RESTRUCTURING

         On October 25, 2000,  AT&T Corp.  announced  its intention to split-off
the AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T. In addition,  AT&T announced its intention to
fully  separate,  or issue  separate  tracking  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial  performance  and economic value of, each of AT&T's other major units:
AT&T Broadband,  AT&T Business Services and AT&T Consumer  Services.  AT&T Corp.
also  announced its plan to distribute  all the common stock it holds in Liberty
Media  Corporation in exchange for all the  outstanding  shares of Liberty Media
Group tracking stock.
<PAGE>

         AT&T Corp.  expects the  separations of AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty
Media  Corporation to occur around the middle of 2001.  Later in the year,  AT&T
Corp.  plans to create and issue new  tracking  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial performance and economic value of the AT&T Broadband unit and the AT&T
Consumer  Services  unit.  Within  about a year after the  issuance of these new
tracking stocks,  AT&T Broadband is expected to be fully separated from the rest
of  AT&T.  Upon  that  separation,  the  AT&T  Business  Services  unit  and the
separately  tracked AT&T Consumer  Services unit would  constitute  one publicly
traded company,  and AT&T Broadband would constitute a separate  publicly traded
company.  The various elements of the plan are not conditioned on the successful
completion  of all  elements  of the plan.  Many of these  steps,  however,  are
subject to conditions,  including IRS rulings,  shareholder  approvals and other
uncertainties.  If we fail to satisfy  any  conditions,  or if other  unforeseen
events  intervene,  some or all of our currently  planned steps could occur on a
different  timetable or on different  terms than we  currently  contemplate,  or
might not occur at all.

         AT&T Wireless Group is a part of AT&T Corp. However, in connection with
AT&T Corp.'s  restructuring  plan, subject to specified  conditions,  AT&T Corp.
intends to  split-off  AT&T  Wireless  Group from AT&T  Corp.  These  conditions
include  the  receipt of a favorable  ruling on the  split-off  from the IRS and
satisfaction of conditions contained in AT&T's new $25 billion credit agreement,
including the repayment of AT&T Wireless  Group's  intercompany  obligations  to
AT&T.

         AT&T Corp.  expects that this split-off would be  accomplished  through
the following steps, any or all of which may be effected simultaneously:

               o    Transfer all of the assets and  liabilities of AT&T Wireless
                    Group to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.

               o    Mandatorily exchange, in accordance with the terms of AT&T's
                    charter,  all issued and outstanding shares of AT&T Wireless
                    Group  tracking  stock for shares of AT&T Wireless  Services
                    common stock.

               o    Mandatorily   convert  DoCoMo's   interest  in  AT&T  Corp.,
                    including  its  warrants,   into  shares  of  AT&T  Wireless
                    Services common stock, or in the case of the warrants,  into
                    warrants to purchase AT&T Wireless Services common stock.

               o    Distribute  on a pro rata basis to  holders  of AT&T  common
                    stock all  shares  of AT&T  Wireless  Services  held by AT&T
                    other than any of these  shares  retained  by AT&T or shares
                    subject to certain adjustment arrangements.

         After the  mandatory  exchange is  completed,  holders of AT&T Wireless
Group  tracking stock who do not hold shares of AT&T common stock will no longer
be  shareholders  of AT&T.  In the  mandatory  exchange,  those  holders of AT&T
Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  will  receive  shares of common  stock of AT&T
Wireless Services.

         AT&T has  announced  its  intention  to retain up to $3  billion of the
shares of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. for its own account for sale, exchange or
monetization  within  six  months of the  split-off,  subject  to  receipt  of a
satisfactory IRS ruling. AT&T Corp. does not plan to seek any vote of holders of
AT&T common stock or AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock for the split-off of
AT&T Wireless Services from AT&T Corp.

DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS DURING PAST FIVE YEARS

         Separation

         In  1996  AT&T   separated  its  business  into  three   publicly  held
stand-alone   companies:   the  current  AT&T,  focused  on  communications  and
information   services;   Lucent   Technologies   Inc.   (Lucent),   focused  on
communications  systems and technology;  and NCR Corporation  (NCR),  focused on
transaction-intensive  computing. AT&T distributed to its shareowners all of the
shares AT&T owned of Lucent on  September  30, 1996 and all of the shares of NCR
on December 31, 1996.

         Asset Sales

         Following  the  separation,  AT&T  focused on its core  businesses  and
disposed of assets and businesses that were not strategic. In October 1996, AT&T
completed the sale of its majority interest in AT&T Capital Corporation (leasing
services business).  In 1997, AT&T completed the sales of AT&T Skynet (satellite
services),  AT&T Tridom (satellite data and video communications  services), and
its  submarine  systems  business,   as  well  as  its  investment  in  DirectTV
(direct-broadcast  television service and DSS equipment business).  In addition,
in 1998 AT&T sold AT&T  Universal  Card  Services,  Inc.  (credit card  services
business),  American Transtech Inc. (customer care services),  its investment in
LIN  Television  Corporation  (commercial  television  broadcasting),   and  its
investment in SmarTone  Telecommunications  Holdings  Limited (a wireless  joint
venture in Hong Kong).  In 1999,  AT&T sold its interest in Wood-TV  (commercial
television   broadcasting),   AT&T  Language  Line  Services   (over  the  phone
interpretation    business)    and   ACC    Corp.'s    operations    in   Europe
(telecommunications services).

         TCG Acquisition

         During  1998,  AT&T  engaged  in a series of  transactions  to  further
transform  the Company from one  dominated by a single  product,  domestic  long
distance  telecommunications,  to a fully  integrated,  any distance,  broadband
communications  service  provider.  In July 1998, AT&T completed the merger with
Teleport  Communications  Group  (TCG)  pursuant  to which each share of TCG was
exchanged for AT&T Common Stock in an all-stock transaction. TCG was the largest
competitive  local  exchange  carrier  (CLEC)  in the  United  States,  offering
comprehensive   telecommunications   services  in  major  metropolitan   markets
throughout the United States.

         TCI Acquisition

         On   March   9,   1999,    AT&T    completed   the    acquisition    of
Tele-Communications,  Inc. (TCI) in a merger.  In the merger,  AT&T acquired all
the  business and assets of the TCI Group (now  referred to as AT&T  Broadband),
which  consisted  primarily  of  TCI's  domestic  cable  and  telecommunications
operations,  as well as TCI's interest in At Home  Corporation  (Excite@Home) in
exchange for approximately 664 million shares of Common Stock. AT&T Common Stock
continues to represent an interest in the business and assets of the  historical
AT&T together with those assets acquired in the merger.

         In  addition,  at the time of the merger  TCI  combined  Liberty  Media
Group, its programming  arm, and TCI Ventures Group, its technology  investments
unit, to form the new Liberty Media Group.  The  shareowners  of the new Liberty
Media Group were issued separate  tracking stock rather than traditional  Common
Stock by AT&T Corp.  in exchange for the shares held in Liberty  Media Group and
TCI Ventures  Group.  Under the tracking  stock  arrangement,  the Liberty Media

<PAGE>

Group's earnings and losses are excluded from earnings  available to the holders
of Common Stock and the Liberty Media Group's  businesses and assets are managed
by a separate  operating Board of Directors.  As a result,  although the Liberty
Media Group is wholly owned by AT&T Corp.,  it is accounted for as an investment
under the equity method of accounting in the consolidated  financial  statements
of AT&T Corp. since AT&T does not have a "controlling financial interest" in the
Liberty Media Group.

         IBM Global Network Acquisition

         On April 30, 1999, AT&T completed the first phase of its acquisition of
the IBM Global Network  business  (renamed AT&T Global Network Services or AGNS)
by obtaining the IBM Global Network  assets in the United  States.  The non-U.S.
assets were  acquired  in phases  throughout  1999 and during the first  quarter
2000. Under the terms of the agreement, AT&T acquired the global network of IBM,
and the two companies  entered into  outsourcing  agreements with each other. At
the time of  acquisition,  AGNS served the networking  needs of several  hundred
large global companies,  tens of thousands of mid-sized businesses and more than
one million individual Internet users in 59 countries.

         Vanguard Acquisition

         On  May  3,  1999,  AT&T  acquired  Vanguard  Cellular  Systems,   Inc.
(Vanguard),  an independent operator of wireless telephone systems in the United
States  with over  700,000  subscribers  and which  operates  in markets  with a
population  of  approximately  6.9  million.  Vanguard  served 26 markets in the
Eastern United States.  Consummation of the acquisition resulted in the issuance
of  approximately  12.6  million  shares of AT&T common stock and the payment of
approximately $485 million in cash.

         Comcast Corporation Exchange

         On May 4, 1999,  AT&T  and Comcast announced  an agreement to  exchange
various cable systems, designed to improve each company's geographic coverage by
better clustering its systems. On January 2, 2001 AT&T and Comcast completed the
transfer of cable systems serving a total of nearly 1.5 million customers.  With
the  completion  of this  transaction,  Comcast  assumed the  ownership  of AT&T
Broadband systems serving about 773,000 customers in the areas of Avalon,  N.J.;
Detroit, Mich.; Naples and Fort Myers, Fla.; Pottsville, Penn.; Royal Oak, Mich;
and Washington,  D.C. AT&T Broadband  assumed  ownership of select Comcast cable
systems serving  approximately  700,000 customers in the areas of Atlanta,  Ga.;
Broward County, Fla.; Chicago, Ill.; Longmont,  Colo.;  Sacramento,  Calif.; and
Westmoreland, Penn.


         Cox Communications, Inc. Exchange

         On July 6, 1999,  AT&T and Cox  Communications,  Inc.  (Cox)  signed an
agreement  whereby AT&T would redeem  approximately  50.3 million shares of AT&T
common  stock  held by Cox in  exchange  for cable  television  systems  serving
approximately  312,000  customers,  our  interest  in  certain  investments  and
approximately  $750  million  in  other   consideration,   including  cash.  The
transaction is valued at approximately  $2.7 billion.  The transaction closed in
March 2000.
<PAGE>

         Concert

         On  January  5,  2000  AT&T  and  British  Telecommunications  plc (BT)
announced the financial closure of a global venture to serve the  communications
needs  of  multinational  companies  and  the  international  calling  needs  of
businesses  around the world.  The venture,  named Concert,  is owned equally by
AT&T and BT and combined  transborder  assets and  operations  of each  company,
including their existing  international  networks,  their international traffic,
their transborder  products for business customers -- including an expanding set
of Concert  services  -- and AT&T and BT's  multinational  accounts  in selected
industry sectors.

         MediaOne Group, Inc. Acquisition

         On June 15, 2000,  AT&T  completed a merger with MediaOne  Group,  Inc.
(MediaOne) in a cash and stock transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
At the  time  of the  acquisition,  MediaOne  was one of the  largest  broadband
communications companies in the United States. For each share of MediaOne stock,
MediaOne shareholders received, in the aggregate, 0.95 of a share of AT&T common
stock and $36.27 per share in cash, consisting of $30.85 per share as stipulated
in the  merger  agreement  and  $5.42  per share  based on  AT&T's  stock  price
preceding  the  merger,  which was below a  predetermined  amount.  AT&T  issued
approximately  603 million  shares of common stock,  of which  approximately  60
million were treasury  shares.  The AT&T shares had an aggregate market value of
approximately $21 billion and cash payments totaled approximately $24 billion.

         Wireless Acquistions

         On June 19, 2000, the AT&T Wireless Group  announced that it had signed
definitive agreements to acquire wireless systems in the San Francisco Bay Area,
San Diego and Houston for $3.3 billion in cash. On September 29, 2000,  the AT&T
Wireless Group  completed the  acquisition of the wireless  system in San Diego,
for  approximately  $500 million in cash.  On June 29, 2000,  the AT&T  Wireless
Group  completed the  acquisition  of Vodafone  Airtouch  plc's 50%  partnership
interest in CMT Partners  (the Bay Area  Properties),  which holds a controlling
interest in five Bay Area markets  including  San  Francisco  and San Jose,  for
approximately  $1.8 billion in cash,  thereby  giving the AT&T Wireless  Group a
100%  ownership  interest in this  partnership.  On December 29, 2000,  the AT&T
Wireless  Group  completed the  acquisition of the Houston  wireless  system for
approximately $984 million in cash.

         At Home Corporation

         On August 28, 2000, AT&T and Excite@Home announced shareholder approval
of a new  board of  directors  and  governance  structure  for  Excite@Home  and
completion of the extension of distribution contracts with AT&T, Cox and Comcast
Corporation  (Comcast).  AT&T was  given the  right to  designate  six of the 11
Excite@Home board members. In addition,  Excite@Home converted  approximately 50
million of AT&T's  Series A shares  into  Series B shares,  each of which has 10
votes.  As a result  of these  governance  changes,  AT&T  gained a  controlling
interest and began consolidating  Excite@Home's  results upon the closing of the
transaction on September 1, 2000. As of December 31, 2000,  AT&T had, on a fully
diluted basis,  approximately 23% of the economic interest and 74% of the voting
interest in Excite@Home.
<PAGE>

         In exchange  for Cox and Comcast  relinquishing  their rights under the
shareholder agreement, AT&T granted put options to Cox and Comcast on a combined
total of 60.4  million  shares of  Excite@Home  Series A common  stock.  The put
options  provide Cox and  Comcast  with the right to convert  their  Excite@Home
shares  into  either  AT&T stock or cash at their  option,  at any time  between
January 1, 2001 and June 4, 2002, at the higher of (i) $48 per share or (ii) the
30 day average trading price at the time of exercise  (beginning 15 trading days
prior to the  exercise  date and ending 15 days after the  exercise  date).  The
maximum  amount  that  AT&T  would  be  required  to pay in  cash  or  stock  is
approximately  $2.9 billion based on the $48 strike price.  In January 2001, Cox
and Comcast  exercised their put options in exchange for AT&T common stock. AT&T
is currently in discussions  to  renegotiate  the terms of the put options which
may result in a change to the number of shares.

         Also, in connection with the distribution agreements through 2008, AT&T
obtained the right to purchase up to approximately 25 million Excite@Home Series
A shares and 25 million Series B shares. In addition,  Cox and Comcast will each
receive new  warrants  to purchase  two Series A shares for each home its system
passes.  These warrants will vest in installments  every six months beginning in
June  2001,  and be fully  vested  in June  2006,  if Cox and  Comcast  elect to
continue their extended distribution agreements through that period.

         AB Cellular

         On December 29, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  completed the  disposition of its
equity  interest in AB Cellular to  BellSouth.  Prior to this date,  AT&T held a
55.62% equity interest in AB Cellular,  which was formed in 1998 with BellSouth,
with each party having a 50% voting interest. AB Cellular owned,  controlled and
supervised wireless properties in Los Angeles, Houston and Galveston.  BellSouth
exercised an option available to them,  which resulted in AB Cellular  redeeming
AT&T's interest in AB Cellular in exchange for 100% of the net assets of the Los
Angeles property.

BUSINESS SERVICES

                  Business Services provides a variety of global  communications
services to large domestic and multinational businesses,  small and medium-sized
businesses,  and government  agencies.  Business units within this group provide
regular  and  custom  voice  services  (including  local,  long  distance,   and
international outbound,  800, 877, and 888 and 900 services),  Data and Internet
Protocol Services  (including private line, frame relay,  asynchronous  transfer
mode services) as well as hosting, outsourcing and other consulting services.

                  Business Services has a dedicated sales force through which it
markets its voice and data communication  services.  Sales forces  predominantly
are  divided  into  geographic  markets,  and in each  market  focus  on  large,
multinational   corporations,   small  businesses,   government   markets,   and
value-added  resellers and other  wholesalers.  Business  Services  employs full
service  support teams to provide  significant  customer  support and service to
ensure  customer  satisfaction  and  retention.  A small  number  of its  larger
accounts are served directly by Concert, with Business Services as an underlying
supplier to Concert.

                  Business Services offers its regulated  services in most cases
in accordance  with  applicable  tariffs  filed with the Federal  Communications
Commission  (FCC) and  various  states.  Rates can vary by a number of  factors,
including  the volume and nature of service  committed to AT&T.  AT&T expects to
offer its  interstate  services  on a  detariffed  basis  later this year.  AT&T

<PAGE>

Business Services offers voice and data services individually and in combination
with other offerings.  Through combined offerings,  AT&T provides customers with
benefits such as single billing,  unified services for  multilocation  companies
and customized calling plans.

            Voice Services

            Long distance voice services. Business Services' voice communication
offerings   include  the   traditional   "one  plus"  dialing  of  domestic  and
international long distance for customers that select AT&T as their primary long
distance carrier.

            Business Services also  offers  toll free (800,  888 or 877) inbound
service,  where the  receiving  party pays for the call.  This is used in a wide
variety of  applications,  many of which generate  revenue for the user (such as
reservation  centers or  customer  service  centers).  AT&T  offers a variety of
features to enhance  customers'  toll free  service,  including  call routing by
origination point and time of day routing.

            Business Services also offers a variety of calling cards which allow
the user to  place  calls  from  virtually  anywhere  in the  world.  Additional
features  include  prepaid  calling  cards,  conference  calling,  international
origination, information service access (such as weather or stock quotes), speed
dialing and voice messaging.

            Business Local Services.  Local  carriers   provide  local exchange,
exchange access, toll, and resold services;  sell, install and maintain customer
premises equipment;  and provide operator and directory services. The market for
local exchange  services  consists of a number of distinct  service  components.
These   service   components   are   defined  by  specific   regulatory   tariff
classifications  including:  (i) local network services, which generally include
basic dial tone charges and private line services; (ii) network access services,
which consist of access charges received by local exchange  carriers (LECs) from
long distance  carriers for the local transport and termination  portion of long
distance  telephone calls;  (iii) long distance network services,  which include
the  variable  portion  of  charges  received  by local  exchange  carriers  for
intra-LATA long distance calls; and (iv) additional value added services such as
caller  identification,  call waiting,  call  forwarding,  three way calling and
voice mail.

            AT&T    Business       Local's    customers      are     principally
telecommunications-intensive    businesses,    healthcare,    and    educational
institutions,  governmental  agencies,  long  distance  carriers and  resellers,
Internet service  providers,  disaster  recovery service  providers and wireless
communications and financial services companies. AT&T Business Local's centrally
managed  customer care and support  operations  are designed to  facilitate  the
installation  of new  services  and the  processing  of orders for  changes  and
upgrades in customer services.

            With a direct sales  force  in  each  of its  markets, AT&T Business
Local  initially  targets  the  large  telecommunications-intensive   businesses
concentrated  in the major  metropolitan  markets  served by its networks.  AT&T
Business Local also serves small- and medium-sized business customers.

            AT&T Business Local generally offers its services in accordance with
applicable  tariffs  filed  with  state  regulatory   agencies  (for  intrastate
services).  AT&T  Business  Local  typically  offers local  service as part of a
package of services,  which can include any combination of other AT&T offerings.

<PAGE>

Customers  also  choose  among  analog,  digital  voice-only  and  ISDN  Centrex
telephone lines to their desktops.  AT&T owns, houses, manages and maintains the
switch,  while customers  retain control over network  configurations,  allowing
customers to add, delete and move lines as needed. For local service,  customers
are billed a fixed charge plus usage.

            Data and Internet Services

            Business  Services' data services  include  private line and special
access services that use high-capacity digital circuits to carry voice, data and
video   (or   multimedia)   transmission   from   point-to-point   in   multiple
configurations.  These  services  provide  high-volume  customers  with a direct
connection  to an AT&T switch  instead of switched  access shared by many users.
These services permit  customers to create internal  computer  networks,  access
external  computer  networks  and the  Internet,  as well as reduce  originating
access costs.

            Enhanced Data  Communications.  Enhanced  data  services consist  of
interexchange   data  networks   utilizing  packet  switching  and  transmission
technologies  and  application  services,  such as Internet  access and Web Site
hosting and  management,  which utilize the frame relay  network.  Enhanced data
services enable customers to economically and securely transmit large volumes of
data typically  sent in bursts from one site to another.  Enhanced data services
are utilized for local area network (LAN) interconnection, remote site, point of
sale and branch office communications solutions.

            AT&T utilizes  both IP  and ATM systems.    Both  technologies offer
significant  efficiencies  over  circuit  switched  systems  which use a single,
dedicated  circuit to complete each  transmission.  ATM switching is also a more
efficient  method  of  switching  and   transmitting   comingled  or  multimedia
information. The packet switching technology breaks up a transmission into short
pieces, or packets,  which are encoded and transmitted with other packets on the
same circuit, and reassembled at the desired destination. ATM differs from IP in
that the data packets used in ATM (called cells) are one size (53 bytes) whereas
in IP the data packets vary in length.  Also,  whereas ATM  establishes  virtual
circuits to ensure that the  information  sent is reassembled at its destination
in its proper  sequence,  IP ships each packet of information to its destination
by a different  path.  While AT&T will  continue to have both circuit and packet
switching  and  transmission  technologies  for some  time,  significant  future
capital expenditures are not scheduled for circuit switching.

                  AT&T  Business  Internet  Services.   AT&T  WorldNet  Business
Services provides IP connectivity and IP value-added  services,  messaging,  and
electronic  commerce  services  to  businesses.  AT&T  offers  Managed  Internet
Services,  which  gives  customers  dedicated,  high-speed  access to the public
Internet for business  applications  at a variety of speeds and types of access,
as well as Business Dial Service,  a dial-up version of Internet access designed
to meet the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses.

                  AT&T Virtual Private  Network (VPN) Service allows  businesses
to obtain remote access to e-mail,  order entry systems,  employee  directories,
human resources and other databases, or to create an Intranet and extranets with
their clients,  suppliers and business partners, and enables customers to tailor
their  VPNs  to  accommodate   specific   business   applications,   performance
requirements or the need to integrate with existing data networks.

                  AT&T Web  Services  are a family of  hosting  and  transaction
services and platforms serving the web needs of thousands of businesses.  Offers

<PAGE>

include AT&T Shared  Hosting  Services,  an  economical  way for  businesses  to
establish a presence on the World Wide Web, and AT&T  Enhanced  Web  Development
Package  for  businesses  that want to  create  web sites  that  require  higher
performance and can support greater user demand.  AT&T Dedicated Hosting Service
provides  customizable and pre-packaged  Web hosting  solutions.  AT&T SecureBuy
Service  provides  the  backoffice  infrastructure  required  to  electronically
process  credit  card  transactions  online,  high-speed  links  into two of the
leading credit card processing  services,  and management reports that measure a
site's success.

                  Other IP services AT&T offers let Web site visitors click on a
"call me now" icon if they wish to speak to a customer  service  agent;  connect
enterprise networks that use host or LAN-based and browser-based  e-mail systems
to AT&T's  value-added  messaging  services such as e-mail and fax; and enhanced
fax services.

                  Transport

                  Business Services is one of the leaders in providing wholesale
networking  services to other  carriers,  providing  both  network  capacity and
switched  services.  AT&T  offers  a  combination  of  high-volume  transmission
capacity,  conventional  dedicated line services and dedicated switched services
to  Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  and  Tier 1 and Tier 2  carriers  on a
national or regional  basis,  as well as  switchless  resale  services to Tier 3
carriers.

                  Wholesale networking service is typically provided pursuant to
long-term service  agreements for terms of one year or longer.  These agreements
generally  provide for  payments at fixed rates based on the capacity and length
of the circuit used.  Customers are typically billed on a monthly basis and also
may incur an  installation  charge or certain  ancillary  charges for equipment.
After contract  expiration,  the contracts may be renewed or the services may be
provided on a month-to-month  basis.  Switched services agreements are generally
offered on a month-to-month  basis and the service is billed on a minutes-of-use
basis. More recently,  AT&T has also sold network capacity through  indefeasible
rights of use agreements under which capacity is furnished for contract terms as
long as 25 years.

CONSUMER SERVICES

         Long Distance Voice

         AT&T  is the  leading  provider  of  domestic  and  international  long
distance  service to residential  consumers in the United States.  AT&T provides
regular  and  custom  long  distance  communications  services  which it  offers
individually and in combination with other services.

         AT&T    provides    interstate    and    intrastate    long    distance
telecommunications   services  throughout  the  continental  United  States  and
provides, or joins in providing with other carriers, telecommunications services
to and from Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and international
telecommunications  services to and from  virtually all nations and  territories
around  the  world.  Consumers  can use AT&T  domestic  and  international  long
distance  services by the  traditional  "one plus"  dialing of the desired  call
destination, by dial-up access or through the use of AT&T calling cards.

         AT&T  purchases  transport  services  from Concert for the delivery and
receipt of AT&T's  international  service.  In accordance  with the terms of the

<PAGE>

operating agreements Concert has with foreign carriers throughout the world, the
cost of  transporting  AT&T's  traffic is sensitive to changes in  international
settlement rates and international traffic routing patterns.

         In  the  continental   United  States,   AT&T  provides  long  distance
telecommunications   services  over  AT&T's  backbone   network.   International
telecommunications  services are provided by  submarine  cable  systems in which
AT&T holds investment positions, satellites and facilities of other domestic and
foreign carriers.

         AT&T markets its consumer long distance  services in a variety of ways,
including by means of  television  advertising,  direct mail  solicitations  and
telephonic solicitations, as well as through brand awareness.

         AT&T charges  customers based on applicable  tariffs filed with the FCC
and individual states. Customers select different services and from various rate
plans which  determine the price per minute that they pay on their long distance
calls.  Rates  typically  vary based on a variety of factors,  particularly  the
volume of usage and the day and time that calls are made.

         Consumer Local Services

         Local carriers  provide local exchange,  calling features (such as call
waiting and three-way  calling),  voice mail,  exchange access,  toll, and other
services,  including  operator and directory  assistance and emergency  services
(911/E-911). Increasingly, local carriers are adding high speed data services to
their offerings,  using digital subscriber loop ("DSL") technology. By attaching
extra  electronics  to both ends of a copper loop,  local carriers can transform
the loop into a broadband gateway capable of supporting  upstream and downstream
data feeds at high rates of speed.

         By the end of 2000, AT&T offered local service to residential customers
using non facilities-based  connectivity  (resold/combined incumbent LEC (ILECs)
networks and services) in 8 states, and offered facilities-based cable telephony
services in 16 states.  AT&T currently is testing DSL-based  offerings to add to
its package of services. Notwithstanding its substantial efforts, AT&T continues
to experience significant  difficulty entering local markets.  AT&T's ability to
purchase  combined  network  elements from the ILECs, one of the primary methods
AT&T intends to use to provide local service to residential customers, continued
to be severely hampered by, among other factors,  ILEC-sponsored  regulatory and
judicial actions,  and lack of operating interfaces necessary to process network
element orders with ILECs. Despite strong customer demand for competitive choice
in local markets outside of AT&T's cable footprint,  AT&T has suspended sales of
resold  local   service,   and   continues  to  provide   network   element  non
facilities-based  local  service only in New York and Texas.  AT&T will continue
its  regulatory  efforts to  improve  operating  margins in the states  where it
offers  non-facilities-based  local services, and will seek to open other states
to competitive opportunities (both for voice and data services) by improving the
rates, rules and operating interfaces that govern carrier relationships.

                  AT&T also has pursued  local entry by  transforming  the cable
footprint of one-way cable plant into a two-way,  broadband  network  capable of
meeting  the  full  spectrum  of  residential  customer   communications  needs,
including  a  richly  featured  all  distance  (i.e.,   local,   long  distance,
international)  voice telephony  offering.  AT&T uses existing  circuit switched
technology  to  provide  telephony  service  offers  over the cable  plant in 18
markets spanning 16 states. AT&T expects to begin to transition to an integrated
Internet  protocol (IP) packet data architecture by the end of 2003 that affords

<PAGE>

cost and feature benefits over the older circuit-switched technology.

                  In addition,  AT&T,  through AT&T Consumer Services as well as
its other  business  units,  may pursue other  economically  feasible  transport
options, including:

               o    Expanding AT&T's ability to offer the full range of consumer
                    services  beyond  our  existing  cable  footprint  through a
                    variety of partnership and investment initiatives;

               o    Continued investment in alternative narrowband, wideband and
                    broadband access technologies,  including the fixed wireless
                    technology that AT&T is currently testing in select markets,
                    and the  construction  of  dedicated,  high-capacity  access
                    facilities  to serve the  broadband  communication  needs of
                    residential  customers  living in  multiple  dwelling  units
                    (MDUs); and

               o    Using  combinations of ILEC unbundled network  elements,  as
                    well as ILEC  unbundled  loops  (which can be combined  with
                    switching,  transport and other network elements) to support
                    differentiated voice and data services.

                  AT&T uses the AT&T  Broadband  sales force actively to solicit
cable  customers  as local  service  customers.  AT&T intends to offer cable and
local  telephony  as a  services  package  to  those  customers  who  find  this
appealing.  AT&T will  market  local  service in other areas as it rolls out its
local telephony capabilities.

                  AT&T currently offers its local  subscribers a suite of offers
including  "blocks of time" for toll and long distance calls at a flat price, or
per minute charges using one of AT&T's competitive service offerings.

         AT&T WorldNet(R) Consumer Services

                  AT&T offers dial-up  Internet access to consumers  through its
award-winning  AT&T WorldNet  Services,  a leading  provider of Internet  access
service in the United States.  At December 31, 2000,  AT&T WorldNet  Service had
approximately 1.423 million customers.

                  In 1999, AT&T WorldNet  Service began offering members an AT&T
branded  search  engine as part of a redesign  of the  Company's  web site,  and
enhanced  several  other  subscriber  features,  including  increasing  the disk
storage  space for personal  web pages to 10  megabytes  for each e-mail id (six
e-mail ids per account,  60 megabytes of disk  storage) and providing a template
that helps members build personal web pages quickly and easily.

         In 2000, AT&T WorldNet  Service began offering members Internet service
that  includes a  persistently  present  toolbar that  displays  advertising  to
subscribers  even when they were on web sites other than those operated by AT&T.
This new service was marketed  directly by AT&T WorldNet  Service and indirectly
through several major distribution arrangements.

         J.D. Power and Associates  ranked AT&T WorldNet  Service #1 in Customer
Satisfaction among the largest national Internet Service Providers in their 2000
National Internet Service Provider Customer  Satisfaction StudySM based on 4,173
responses.  AT&T earned its top position of overall customer  satisfaction based
on seven factors, including speed/availability,  cost/billing/image, suitability

<PAGE>

of  services/content,   customer   care/technical   support,   e-mail  services,
navigation/access  to other portals and ease of use. In November,  PC World gave
AT&T WorldNet Service their Best Buy award,  noting AT&T's  outstanding  dial-up
speed,  high connection  success rate,  extras like multiple  e-mail boxes,  and
superior support.

         AT&T  WorldNet  Services   generates   revenues   principally   through
subscription and usage fees, as well as from electronic commerce and advertising
revenues.  AT&T  WorldNet  Service  offers a variety  of pricing  plan  options,
including  bundled  options with AT&T Long  Distance and AT&T  Wireless  offers.
Generally,  customers are charged a flat rate for a certain number of hours with
charges for each additional  hour of usage. In addition,  WorldNet offers a plan
without a usage restriction.

         AT&T WorldNet Service's  marketing programs are designed to attract and
retain profitable customers.  AT&T seeks to build brand recognition and customer
loyalty and to make it easy for  consumers to try, and stay with,  AT&T WorldNet
Service.  In addition to direct marketing  through brand name mass  advertising,
direct mail and magazine insert  promotions and bundling  offers,  AT&T WorldNet
Service  maintains a large  indirect  channel  marketing  effort.  Through  this
indirect  channel AT&T  WorldNet  Service  software is bundled in new  computers
produced by major manufacturers,  and is included on millions of software titles
published by  independent  software  vendors.  AT&T WorldNet  Service also has a
co-branded ISP offer enabling  businesses to offer  customers their own branded,
full-featured Internet access in affiliation with AT&T.

BROADBAND SERVICES

         AT&T Broadband offers a variety of services through its cable broadband
network,  including  traditional  analog video and new services  such as digital
cable,  AT&T@Home and RoadRunner  (which AT&T has agreed to divest, as described
below),  which offers high-speed cable Internet  service.  Also included in AT&T
Broadband  are the  operations  associated  with  developing  and  refining  the
infrastructure that support broadband telephony.

         Cable  television   systems  receive  video,  audio  and  data  signals
transmitted  by nearby  television  and radio  broadcast  stations,  terrestrial
microwave relay services and  communications  satellites.  Such signals are then
amplified and  distributed by coaxial cable and optical fiber to the premises of
customers who pay a fee for the service. In many cases, cable television systems
also originate and distribute local programming.

         At December  31,  2000 over 75% of AT&T  Broadband's  cable  television
systems had bandwidth capacities of at least 550 megahertz, with the majority of
the network upgraded to 750 megahertz.  The Company's cable  television  systems
generally carry up to 80 analog  channels.  Compressed  digital video technology
converts on average twelve analog signals (now used to transmit video and voice)
into a digital  format  and  compresses  such  signals  (which  is  accomplished
primarily by eliminating the redundancies in television  imagery) into the space
normally  occupied by one analog  signal.  The  digitally  compressed  signal is
uplinked to a satellite,  which retransmits the signal to a customer's satellite
dish or to a cable  system's  headend to be  distributed,  via optical fiber and
coaxial  cable,  to the  customer's  home. At the home, a set-top video terminal
converts the digital signal into analog  channels that can be viewed on a normal
television set.

         Domestic   Basic-TV  cable  customers  served  by  AT&T  Broadband  are
summarized as follows (amounts in millions):

         In  addition  to the above,  the FCC has taken the  position  that AT&T
Broadband is attributed  with the  subscribers of (i) Time Warner  Entertainment
and Time Warner, Inc. as a consequence of the acquisition of MediaOne,  Inc. and
(ii) various other  entities as a  consequence  of AT&T's  investments  in those
entities.  As of December 31, 2000 the  aggregate  attributable  subscribers  is
11.22 million.

         AT&T Broadband had  approximately  2.9 million  digital video customers
and 1.1 million high speed cable Internet customers through Excite@Home and Road
Runner as of December 31, 2000.

         AT&T Broadband  completed a significant  number of transactions in 2000
which substantially changed the size and profile of its cable system network.

         On January 18, 2000, a subsidiary of AT&T  Broadband sold its entire 50
percent interest in Lenfest Communications,  Inc. to a subsidiary of Comcast. In
consideration for its 50 percent interest,  AT&T Broadband  received  47,289,843
shares  of  Comcast  Special  Class A common  stock,  which had a value of $2.51
billion at the time of the transaction.

         On February 14, 2000, AT&T Broadband redeemed a portion of its interest
in Bresnan  for $285  million  in cash.  AT&T  Broadband  then  contributed  its
remaining  interest  in Bresnan to CC VIII,  LLC,  in  exchange  for a preferred
ownership interest.

         On March 15, 2000, AT&T Broadband  redeemed  approximately 50.3 million
shares of Common Stock held by Cox in exchange for stock of a subsidiary of AT&T
Broadband owning cable television systems serving over 300,000  customers,  AT&T
Broadband's interest in certain  investments,  and $750 million in other assets,
including cash. This transaction was valued at approximately $2.7 billion.

         On April 7, 2000, AT&T Broadband contributed 103,000 subscribers into a
joint  venture  with  Midcontinent  Communications,  Inc. in  exchange  for a 50
percent interest in Midcontinent Communications, a general partnership.

         On June 15, 2000,  MediaOne Group, Inc. merged into a direct subsidiary
of  AT&T  Broadband.   With  the  addition  of  MediaOne's  five  million  cable
subscribers,  AT&T  Broadband  became the  country's  largest  cable  television
operator.
<PAGE>

         Effective December 31, 2000, AT&T Broadband transferred systems serving
approximately  733,000 subscribers and located primarily in Michigan and Naples,
Florida,  to Comcast in  exchange  for  systems  serving  approximately  700,000
subscribers and located primarily in Florida and Chicago, Illinois.

         On January 5, 2001,  AT&T Broadband sold 99,000  subscribers to Insight
Communications, Inc. (Insight Communications). In a subsequent transaction, AT&T
Broadband contributed 250,000 additional  subscribers in the Illinois markets to
Insight Midwest,  L.P., and Insight  Communications also contributed  additional
subscribers.  Insight Midwest,  L.P.  remained a partnership owned 50 percent by
AT&T  Broadband  and 50 percent by Insight  Communications.  The expanded  joint
venture will continue to be managed by Insight Communications.

         Also on January 5, 2001, AT&T and Cablevision  announced the completion
of  two  separate   agreements  for  the  transfer  of  cable  systems.  In  the
transactions,  AT&T received cable systems serving 358,000 subscribers in Boston
and Eastern  Massachusetts.  In return,  Cablevision  acquired  systems  serving
approximately  130,000  subscribers  in  the  northern  New  York  suburbs,  and
approximately  $870 million in stock, or 44 million shares of AT&T common stock,
and approximately $300 million in cash.

         On February 27, 2001, AT&T Broadband  announced that AT&T Broadband had
entered into definitive asset purchase  agreements with Mediacom  Communications
Corporation  (Mediacom)  pursuant to which AT&T  Broadband will sell to Mediacom
cable  television  systems  serving about 840,000 basic  subscribers in Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, for $2.215 billion in cash.

         On February 28, 2001, AT&T Broadband  announced that AT&T Broadband and
Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) had signed definitive agreements pursuant
to which (i) Charter will receive cable systems from AT&T serving  approximately
574,000 customers in the St. Louis area; areas of Auburn, Birmingham, Montgomery
and Selma,  Alabama;  and the Reno area of Nevada and California;  and (ii) AT&T
Broadband will receive $1.79 billion  consisting of Charter cable systems valued
at $249 million serving 62,000 customers in Miami Beach and Sebastian,  Florida;
up to $500 million in Charter common stock; and the balance in cash.

         The decline in total basic service  customers  between 1997 and 1998 is
attributable to certain  contribution  transactions entered into in 1998. In the
most  significant  of  these  transactions,  on March 4,  1998,  AT&T  Broadband
contributed  to  Cablevision  certain of its cable  television  systems  serving
approximately 830,000 customers in exchange for approximately 48.9 million newly
issued  Cablevision Class A common shares (the Cablevision  Transaction) and the
assumption of indebtedness.

         In addition to the Cablevision Transaction,  during 1998 AT&T Broadband
also  completed  eight  transactions  whereby AT&T Broadband  contributed  cable
television systems serving in the aggregate approximately 1,924,000 customers to
eight  separate  joint  ventures  (collectively,  the 1998  Joint  Ventures)  in
exchange  for  non-controlling  ownership  interests  in each of the 1998  Joint
Ventures,  and the  assumption  and  repayment  by the 1998  Joint  Ventures  of
indebtedness.

         AT&T Broadband  operates cable television systems throughout the United
States.

         Service Charges

         AT&T Broadband offers a limited "basic service" (primarily comprised of
local broadcast  signals and public,  educational and governmental  (PEG) access

<PAGE>

channels)  and a "standard  package"  (primarily  comprised of basic service and
specialized programming services, in such areas as health, family entertainment,
religion, news, weather, public affairs, education, shopping, sports and music).
The monthly fee for basic service generally ranges from $7.50 to $12.00, and the
monthly  service fee for the standard  package  generally  ranges from $22.50 to
$36.00. Many of the systems acquired in the MediaOne  acquisition also offered a
third tier of service which generally ranged from $2.00 to $6.00. AT&T Broadband
offers  "premium  services"  (referred  to in the cable  television  industry as
"Pay-TV" and "pay-per-view") to its customers. Such services consist principally
of feature films,  as well as live and taped sports  events,  concerts and other
programming.  AT&T  Broadband  also offers  Pay-TV  services  for a monthly fee.
Charges are usually  discounted  when  multiple  Pay-TV  services  are  ordered.
Customers may also elect to subscribe to digital video services  comprised of up
to 80 additional  video channels and between 10 and 30 additional audio channels
featuring additional specialized  programming and premium services at an average
incremental monthly charge of $10.00.

         As further  enhancements to their cable services,  for a monthly charge
customers  may generally  rent  converters  or  converters  with remote  control
devices,  as well as purchase a channel guide. Also a nonrecurring  installation
charge is usually charged.

         Monthly fees for basic services,  standard  package services and Pay-TV
services to commercial customers vary widely depending on the nature and type of
service.  Except  under the terms of certain  contracts  to  provide  service to
commercial  accounts,  customers  are free to  discontinue  service  at any time
without penalty.

         AT&T Broadband  also offers  AT&T@Home and Road Runner high speed cable
Internet services in some markets. Monthly charges for AT&T@Home and Road Runner
range from $29.95 to $49.95, which includes, under certain offerings, the charge
for rental of cable modem equipment.

         The Cable  Television  Consumer  Protection and Competition Act of 1992
(the   1992   Cable   Act)  and  the   Telecommunications   Act  of  1996   (the
Telecommunications  Act,  together  with the 1992  Cable Act,  the Cable  Acts),
established rules under which AT&T Broadband's basic service rates and equipment
and installation charges are regulated if the appropriate franchise authority is
certified.

         Local Franchises

         Cable television  systems  generally are constructed and operated under
the authority of nonexclusive  permits or  "franchises"  granted by local and/or
state governmental authorities.  Federal law, including the Cable Communications
Policy Act of 1984 (the 1984 Cable Act) and the 1992 Cable Act, limits the power
of  the  franchising   authorities  to  impose  certain  conditions  upon  cable
television operators as a condition of the granting or renewal of a franchise.

         Franchises  contain varying  provisions  relating to  construction  and
operation of cable television systems,  such as time limitations on commencement
and/or  completion of  construction;  quality of service,  including (in certain
circumstances) requirements as to the number of channels and broad categories of
programming  offered to  customers;  rate  regulation;  provision  of service to
certain  institutions;  provision of channels for public access; and maintenance
of insurance and/or indemnity bonds. AT&T Broadband's  franchises also typically
provide  for  periodic  payments of fees,  not to exceed 5% of  revenue,  to the
governmental  authority  granting the franchise.  Additionally,  many franchises

<PAGE>

require  payments  to the  franchising  authority  for the  funding  of  public,
educational and  governmental  access channels.  Franchises  usually require the
consent of the  franchising  authority prior to a transfer of the franchise or a
transfer or change in ownership or operating control of the franchisee.

         Subject to applicable  law, a franchise may be terminated  prior to its
expiration  date if the  cable  television  operator  fails to  comply  with the
material terms and conditions thereof.  Under the 1984 Cable Act, if a franchise
is lawfully terminated,  and if the franchising  authority acquires ownership of
the cable television system or effects a transfer of ownership to a third party,
such  acquisition or transfer must be at an equitable price or, in the case of a
franchise  existing  on the  effective  date of the 1984 Cable  Act,  at a price
determined in accordance with the terms of the franchise, if any.

         In connection with a renewal of a franchise,  the franchising authority
may require  the cable  operator to comply  with  different  and more  stringent
conditions than those originally imposed,  subject to the provisions of the 1984
Cable Act and other applicable federal, state and local law. The 1984 Cable Act,
as supplemented by the renewal provisions of the 1992 Cable Act,  establishes an
orderly  process for franchise  renewal which protects cable  operators  against
unfair denials of renewals when the operator's past performance and proposal for
future  performance  meet the standards  established by the 1984 Cable Act. AT&T
Broadband  believes  that its  cable  television  systems  generally  have  been
operated in a manner which  satisfies  such standards and allows for the renewal
of such franchises;  however,  there can be no assurance that the franchises for
such systems will be successfully renewed as they expire.

         Most of AT&T  Broadband's  present  franchises  had  initial  terms  of
approximately  10 to 15 years.  The  duration  of AT&T  Broadband's  outstanding
franchises  presently varies from a period of months to an indefinite  period of
time. More than fifteen hundred of AT&T Broadband's franchises expire within the
next three years.  This  represents more than 35% percent of the franchises held
by AT&T Broadband and involves over four million basic customers.

         Cable Telephony

         AT&T Broadband's telephony market initiatives progressed  substantially
in 2000.  As of December 31, 2000,  AT&T  Broadband  had  approximately  547,000
telephony  customers  in 17 markets.  The markets in which  Broadband  telephony
service is available are:  Atlanta,  Boston,  the California Bay Area,  Chicago,
Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Florida, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Seattle, Salt Lake City,
St. Louis, Southern California and Portland,  Oregon. AT&T Broadband's Telephony
offerings  include  AT&T  Digital  Phone local phone  service,  unlimited  local
calling, low in-state long distance calling rates, By the Minute (BTM) and Block
of Time (BOT) calling plans, up to 4 lines,  custom calling feature  selections,
and feature  packages.  The  features  available  are Call  Waiting,  Caller ID,
Anonymous Call Rejection,  Call Forwarding,  Custom Ring,  3-Way Calling,  Speed
Dialing, LD Alert,  Distinctive Call Ringing, and Voice Mail, among others. AT&T
Broadband  offers a variety of options  and  calling  plans with  various  price
points to meet our customer's  needs.  They range from basic one line service to
multiple lines with full feature functionality.

         Joint Ventures

         AT&T  Broadband  possesses a number of  investments  in  publicly  held
companies,  joint ventures or partnerships,  the three most significant of which
are At Home  Corporation,  Time Warner  Entertainment  Company,  L.P.,  and Road
Runner LLC.
<PAGE>

         At Home  Corporation.  At Home Corporation is a provider of content and
cable  internet  services over the cable  television  infrastructure  and leased
digital  telecommunication  lines to consumers and  businesses.  On September 1,
2000, Excite@Home converted approximately 50 million of the Excite@Home Series A
shares held by AT&T Broadband into Series B shares, each of which has ten votes.
As a result,  AT&T  Broadband has, on a fully diluted  basis,  approximately  23
percent of the  economic  interest  and 74 percent  of the  voting  interest  in
Excite@Home.  AT&T's interest reflects modifications to Excite@Home's governance
structure which were effective on September 1, 2000. Based upon these governance
changes, Excite@Home's financial results, which previously were accounted for by
AT&T as a  nonoperational  equity  investment  are now  fully  consolidated  and
included  in AT&T's  financial  results.  On January 12,  2001,  Comcast and Cox
exercised  their  right to sell a total of  approximately  60 million  shares of
Excite@Home  to  AT&T  as  part  of  the  agreement  to  reorganize  Excite@Home
governance.

         Time Warner  Entertainment  Company,  L.P.  ("TWE").  TWE is a Delaware
limited partnership that was formed in 1992 to own and operate substantially all
of the  business  of Warner  Bros.,  Home Box  Office  and the cable  television
businesses owned and operated by Time Warner prior to such time.  AT&T's current
interest  in TWE was  initially  acquired  by U S WEST,  Inc.  in 1993,  and was
acquired by AT&T in connection with its 2000 acquisition of MediaOne Group, Inc.
Currently, AT&T, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns general and limited
partnership  interests  in 25.51% of the pro rata  priority  capital  ("Series A
Capital") and residual equity capital ("Residual Capital") of TWE. The remaining
74.49%  limited  partnership  interests  in the  Series A Capital  and  Residual
Capital of TWE are held by  subsidiaries  of AOL Time  Warner  Inc.  AT&T has an
option to increase  its Series A Capital and  Residual  Capital  interests  from
25.51% to up to 31.84% in certain  events.  Subsidiaries of AOL Time Warner Inc.
act as the  general  partners  of TWE,  and  AT&T has  only  certain  protective
governance rights pertaining to certain limited  significant matters relating to
TWE.

         On February 28, 2001, AT&T submitted a request to TWE,  pursuant to the
TWE partnership  agreement,  that TWE  reconstitute  itself as a corporation and
register  for sale in an  initial  public  offering  an  amount  of  partnership
interests  held by AT&T (up to the full  amount held by AT&T)  determined  by an
independent  investment  banking  firm  so  as  to  provide  sufficient  trading
liquidity  and  minimize  the  initial  public  offering  discount,  if any (the
"Registrable Amount").  Under the TWE partnership agreement,  upon such request,
AT&T and Time  Warner  Inc.  are to cause an  independent  investment  banker to
determine  both the  Registrable  Amount and the price at which the  Registrable
Amount  could  be  sold in a  public  offering  (the  "Appraised  Value").  Upon
determination  of the Registrable  Amount and the Appraised Value, TWE may elect
not to register  such  interests but instead to allow AT&T the option to require
that TWE purchase the  Registrable  Amount at the  Appraised  Value,  subject to
certain  adjustments.  If AT&T does put the Registrable Amount to TWE under such
circumstances,  TWE may call the remainder of AT&T's  interest in TWE at a price
described  in the TWE  partnership  agreement.  If TWE  elects to  register  the
interests,  TWE may have an option to purchase such interests  immediately prior
to the time such public offering would otherwise have been declared effective by
the Securities  and Exchange  Commission at the proposed  public  offering price
less underwriting fees and discounts,  if the proposed public offering price (as
determined  by the  managing  underwriter)  is less than 92.5% of the  Appraised
Value. If at the conclusion of this process, AT&T has any remaining interests in
TWE,  AT&T will have the right to request  registration  of such  interests  for
public sale within 60 days of July 1, 2002.

         Road Runner LLC. Road Runner LLC is a limited  liability company formed
in  1998  by  affiliates  of  MediaOne  Group,  Time  Warner,  Advance/Newhouse,
Microsoft  and Compaq,  for purposes of  developing  and  distributing  internet
services  over  the  cable  television  infrastructure.  AT&T  acquired  a 25.1%
interest in Road Runner as part of its 2000 acquisition of MediaOne Group,  Inc.
As a condition to its approval of AT&T's acquisition of MediaOne, the Department
of Justice required that AT&T agree to divest its ownership its interest in Road
Runner within certain  specified time frames  specified.  AT&T,  Time Warner and
Advance Newhouse approved a resolution of the Members'  Committee of Road Runner
effective  December 29, 2000,  declaring the  dissolution  of Road Runner.  As a
result of such resolution,  Road Runner commenced the winding up of its business
in accordance with its organizational documents, which winding up is expected to
be completed approximately March 31, 2001. AT&T has a 31.4% residual interest in
all Road  Runner  assets and  liabilities  following  the  winding  up. AT&T has
entered into a Transitional  Affiliation Agreement with an affiliate of AOL Time
Warner  effective  December 15, 2000,  under which AT&T will receive  transition
support services sufficient to provide uninterrupted  internet service to AT&T's
existing Road Runner subscribers.

WIRELESS SERVICES

The AT&T Wireless Group Tracking Stock

         On April 27, 2000,  AT&T  created a new class of stock and  completed a
public stock offering of 360 million shares,  which  represented  15.6%, of AT&T
Wireless  Group  tracking  stock at a price of $29.50 per  share.  This stock is
intended  to track  the  financial  performance  and  economic  value of  AT&T's
wireless  services.  The net  proceeds  to AT&T  after  deducting  underwriter's
discount and related fees and expenses,  were $10.3 billion. AT&T allocated $7.0
billion  of the net  proceeds  to AT&T  Wireless  Group,  which  were  used  for
acquisitions,  network expansion, capital expenditures and for general corporate
purposes.  The  remaining net proceeds of $3.3 billion were utilized by AT&T for
general  corporate  purposes.  Holders of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock are
entitled to one-half of a vote per share. The AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AWE."

         AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock is designed to reflect the separate
economic  performance of the AT&T Wireless Group.  Except as described below, we
attribute all of AT&T's current wireless  operations to the AT&T Wireless Group,
including:

     o    all mobile and fixed wireless licenses,

     o    all wireless  networks,  operations,  cell sites,  retail  operations,
          wireless customer care facilities and customer location assets, and

     o    interests in  partnerships  and affiliates  providing  wireless mobile
          communications in the United States and internationally.

          The AT&T Common Stock Group retains:

     o    existing   and   future    wireless    activities   that   stem   from
          country-specific  joint venture  relationships  that are predominantly
          non-wireless, and

     o    incidental  wireless  capabilities  or links in any  backbone or other
          communications network that is predominantly non-wireless.
<PAGE>

         We  currently  intend,  until  and  through  the  date of the  proposed
split-off, to include all future wireless activities in the AT&T Wireless Group.
Our board of directors may, however, in its discretion,  but subject to the AT&T
Wireless  Group policy  statement,  direct new businesses and assets to the AT&T
Wireless  Group  or the  AT&T  Common  Stock  Group or  dispose  of or  transfer
businesses or assets of either group.

         Please see Exhibit (99)a to this Form 10-K for supplemental information
concerning the AT&T Wireless Group.

Business of the AT&T Wireless Group

         AT&T Wireless Group is one of the largest wireless service providers in
the United States. AT&T Wireless Group seeks to provide high quality, innovative
wireless  services  and to  expand  its  customer  base and  revenue  stream  by
attracting subscribers who are heavy users of communication  services. As of, or
for the year ended, December 31, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group had:

     o    15.2 million consolidated subscribers,

     o    $10.4 billion of combined revenues, and

     o    $1.6 billion of combined operational EBITDA.

         AT&T Wireless Group operates one of the largest U.S.  digital  wireless
networks.  As of December 31, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group and its affiliates and
partners  held 850  megahertz and 1900  megahertz  licenses to provide  wireless
services  covering  98%  of  the  U.S.  population.  As of  December  31,  2000,
approximately 77% of the U.S. population was covered by at least 30 megahertz of
wireless  spectrum owned by AT&T Wireless Group, its affiliates or its partners.
At the end of 2000, AT&T Wireless  Group's  networks and those of its affiliates
and partners operated in markets  including over 76% of the U.S.  population and
in 49 of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. AT&T Wireless group supplements
its operations  with roaming  agreements that allow its subscribers to use other
providers' wireless services in regions where it does not have operations.  With
these  roaming  agreements,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  is able to  offer  customers
wireless services covering over 95% of the U.S. population.  AT&T Wireless Group
plans to continue to increase  its  coverage  and the quality of its services by
expanding  its  footprint  and the  capacity of its network  through new network
construction, acquisitions, and partnerships with other wireless providers.

         Services and products

         AT&T  Wireless  Group  offers a variety of services  for both voice and
data communications.  Service can include wireless voice transmission as well as
custom calling  services for digital  services,  such as extended  battery life,
message  waiting  indicator,  text  messaging and caller ID. AT&T Wireless Group
also offers a variety of other enhanced  features,  including enhanced directory
assistance,  which enables callers to be connected to the party whose number was
sought without hanging up and redialing.

         As a packet-switched  data network,  AT&T Wireless Group's current data
network takes  advantage of the fact that with many data  applications,  data is
sent in bursts with intermittent quiet periods, which allows many users to share
the  network  channel.  As a result,  relative  to data  services  carried  over
circuit-switched  analog or digital  wireless  networks,  AT&T Wireless  Group's
packet-switched  data service is a significantly  more  cost-effective  means of
sending data for the majority of applications  because it allows a channel to be
shared by many users. For example, for many applications,  AT&T Wireless Group's
packet-switched  data network allows it to offer its customers  unlimited usage,
most often for a flat monthly  fee.  This makes the data service on this network
service attractive for a variety of new applications.
<PAGE>

         AT&T  Wireless  Group has  created  applications  and offers  using the
cellular  digital  packet  data  network for  businesses,  public  agencies  and
consumers. To date, corporations and public agencies have been significant users
of AT&T Wireless Group's packet data service. These customers typically use this
service to carry industry-specific  applications.  Examples of such applications
include public safety applications,  dispatch applications, wireless credit card
validation and automated vehicle location services.  New devices are driving the
development  of broader  applications  targeted to  consumers.  Users may access
these  applications with hand held devices,  like the Palm Vx, as well as phones
and laptop computers.

         For hand  held  devices,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  now has  access to new
CDPD-standard  modems  that  work  with the Palm Vx  device.  Users  can  access
Internet-based  information  from devices  equipped with these modems. A leading
example of this is the OmniSky service available for the Palm Vx. With a Palm Vx
equipped with a modem that connects to AT&T Wireless Group's current packet data
network,  an  OmniSky  subscriber  can access  email as well as several  hundred
content  providers  that have  created  information  specifically  for hand held
devices.

         AT&T Wireless  Group offers a variety of products as complements to its
wireless  service,  including  handsets  and  accessories,   such  as  chargers,
headsets,  belt clips,  faceplates and  batteries.  As part of its basic service
offering,  AT&T Wireless Group  provides  easy-to-use,  interactive  menu-driven
handsets that can be activated over the air. These  handsets  primarily  feature
word prompts and menus rather than numeric codes to operate  handset  functions.
Some handsets  allow mobile access to the Internet.  In addition,  AT&T Wireless
Group offers tri-mode  handsets,  which are handsets  compatible with analog and
digital networks, the latter with 850 and 1900 megahertz frequencies and service
modes.  Tri-mode  handsets permit customers to roam across a variety of wireless
networks and incorporate AT&T Wireless Group's  proprietary  intelligent roaming
data  base  system,  which is  designed  to  provide  service  in more  areas at
favorable  roaming rates. AT&T Wireless Group offers its customers use of Nokia,
Ericsson, Mitsubishi and Motorola handsets.

         AT&T  Wireless  Group  markets  its  wireless  services  in its managed
markets under the AT&T brand name. It markets wireless  services to business and
residential  customers  through a direct  sales  force of 2,100,  through  sales
points of presence in approximately 520 AT&T Wireless Group company-owned stores
located  in 37  states,  and  kiosks  and other  customer  points  of  presence,
including the Internet and inbound call centers,  and through local and national
non-affiliated  retailers  throughout the United States.  AT&T's sales force may
sell wireless services to business and residential  customers as part of bundled
offerings with services of AT&T when agreed upon by the companies. AT&T Wireless
Group also relies upon dealers to market its services in some locations.

         AT&T Wireless  Group  charges may include fees for service  activation,
monthly access,  per-minute  airtime and  customer-calling  features,  which may
include a fixed  number of  minutes  or packets of data per month at a set price
and generally offers a variety of pricing options, most of which combine a fixed
monthly  access  fee for a fixed  number  of  minutes  or  packets  of data  and
additional  charges for usage in excess of those  allotted.  Customers  may also
incur long distance and roaming fees.  AT&T Wireless  Group manages its exposure
to bad debt by  reviewing  prospective  customers  for  creditworthiness  and by
deactivating accounts which reach a specific date past due.

 In calendar year 2000,  AT&T Wireless Group adjusted its credit  policies to be
more competitive,  thereby  increasing the number of customers with lower credit
ratings.  AT&T Wireless Group expects that this may result in an increase in the
number of deactivations and, consequently, churn.

         Fixed Wireless

         Fixed wireless service  provides  customers with high speed packet data
channel  which  can be used  by up to  five  data  devices  simultaneously  (for
example,  five  personal  computers  simultaneously  accessing  the Internet) at
download speeds of up to one megabit per second. In addition, fixed wireless can
provide up to four lines of wireline quality voice  telephony,  including custom
calling features (e.g., call waiting,  caller ID, three-way  calling)  available
today over wireline  networks.  As of December 31, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group was
serving fixed  wireless  customers in Anchorage,  Alaska,  Dallas/Ft.  Worth and
Houston, Texas, and San Diego, California.

         Other assets

         The AT&T  Wireless  Group  also  possesses  certain  other  assets  not
described above. The most significant of these assets include a number of equity
interests in domestic and international wireless operations and an air-to-ground
wireless operation.

         Domestically,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  has  joint  ventures  with or
interests  in a  number  of  wireless  operators,  including  American  Cellular
Corporation,  Cincinnati  Bell  Wireless,  LLC,  Telecorp  PCS and  Triton  PCS.
Internationally, the AT&T Wireless Group owns one half of the 33.3% equity stake
in Rogers  Cantel it holds  jointly  with British  Telecommunications.  The AT&T
Wireless Group is the operating partner in wireless ventures in Colombia,  India
and Taiwan.  In 2000,  the AT&T Wireless  Group was also  allocated one half the
interest  that  AT&T  possesses  in Japan  Telecom,  which it  agreed to sell in
February 2001.

         The Aviation  Communications  Division (ACD) of the AT&T Wireless Group
provides air-to-ground communications services. A minority ownership interest in
ACD is held by Rogers  Cantel.  ACD owns and operates a network of  ground-based
and  airborne  telecommunications  equipment  and related  assets  that  deliver
digital telephone service to commercial and private aircraft in North America.

         Wireless network

         The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ownership  position  in U.S.  markets  was
obtained through FCC auctions and the FCC lottery and settlement process as well
as through  acquisitions of, and purchases and exchanges of,  operating  systems
and licenses from or with other wireless service licensees.

         AT&T Wireless Group has made certain commitments to provide funding for
successful  bids  of  Alaska  Native  Wireless,  L.L.C.  for  the C and F  Block
reauction  (FCC Auction 35) which ended January 26, 2001.  At the  conclusion of
the auction,  Alaska Native Wireless was the high bidder on  approximately  $2.9
billion in licenses.  One auction  participant  challenged the qualifications of
Alaska Native Wireless to acquire "closed"  licenses,  which constituted most of
the licenses for which Alaska  Native  Wireless was the  successful  bidder.  In
addition,  the  trustee  in  NextWave  Telecom,  Inc.'s  Chapter  11  bankruptcy
proceeding,  and the unsecured creditors of NextWave,  are challenging the right
of the FCC to re-auction the 1900 megahertz  licenses that NextWave  acquired in
prior FCC  auctions but which were later  reclaimed by the FCC.  Either of these
proceedings  could  result in a delay in the  grant of  licenses  to  successful
bidders or revocation of any licenses, including those won or acquired by Alaska
Native  Wireless.  AT&T Wireless Group has committed to provide  funding of $2.6
billion in exchange for a combination of a  non-controlling  equity interest and
debt  securities  of  Alaska  Native  Wireless  to fund  its  purchase  of these

<PAGE>

licenses. AT&T Wireless Group's own spectrum,  together with the spectrum of its
affiliates and the spectrum on which Alaska Native  Wireless was the high bidder
in the recently  completed  FCC spectrum  auction,  would be sufficient to serve
over 85 of the  top 100  markets  with  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  selected  third
generation technology, UMTS. Although Alaska Native Wireless is obligated to use
technology  that is compatible  and  interoperable  with AT&T  Wireless  Group's
digital mobile wireless network,  no commitments have been made by Alaska Native
Wireless to AT&T Wireless  Group  concerning  the deployment of the licenses for
which it was high bidder,  and not all  affiliates may be obligated to implement
AT&T  Wireless  Group's  third  generation  technology  strategy.  Under certain
conditions,  and in  addition to other  means by which they may  transfer  their
interests,  the other owners of Alaska Native Wireless have the right to require
us to purchase their equity  interests.  If this right were exercised five years
after license grant,  the price could be as much as  approximately  $950 million
and would be  payable,  at our option,  in cash or  marketable  securities.  The
amount would be less if the right were exercised earlier. Formal grant to Alaska
Native Wireless of the licenses successfully bid upon in the auction has not yet
occurred and is subject to administrative procedures.

         Mobile voice network

         Coverage.  As of December 31, 2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  built
network,  including  partnership and affiliate markets,  covered 98% of the U.S.
population,  including  operations  in 49 of the 50  largest  U.S.  metropolitan
areas.  The AT&T Wireless  operates  using both 850 megahertz and 1900 megahertz
licenses.  Where  agreements  are in place,  the AT&T Wireless  Group is able to
offer service to customers of other wireless  providers when they travel through
its service area,  and AT&T Wireless  Group  subscribers  can roam through other
wireless providers' service areas.

         Analog and digital  technologies.  The AT&T Wireless  Group offers both
analog and digital  service in its 850 megahertz  markets and digital service in
its 1900  megahertz  markets.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group  believes  that digital
technology   offers   many   advantages   over  analog   technology,   including
substantially  increased  network  capacity,   greater  call  privacy,  enhanced
services and features,  lower operating costs,  reduced  susceptibility to fraud
and the opportunity to provide improved data transmissions.  Moving customers to
digital  service has been a key component of the AT&T Wireless  Group's  overall
wireless  strategy.  Digital  service enables the AT&T Wireless Group to provide
added benefits and services to its customers,  including  extended battery life,
caller ID, text messaging and voicemail with message waiting indicator.

         TDMA network. The AT&T Wireless Group has chosen time division multiple
access  (TDMA)  technology  for its second  generation  voice  digital  network,
although  it does  operate  a small a number  of  markets  using  code  division
multiple  access (CDMA) that were operating that  technology  when AT&T Wireless
Group acquired  them.  TDMA permits the use of advanced  tri-mode  handsets that
allow for roaming across analog and digital systems and across 850 megahertz and
1900 megahertz  spectrums.  TDMA digital technology allows for enhanced services
and features, such as short alphanumeric message service, extended battery life,
added call  security  and  improved  voice  quality.  TDMA's  hierarchical  cell
structure enables the AT&T Wireless Group to enhance network coverage with lower
incremental  investment  through the deployment of micro and pico, as opposed to
macro,  cell sites.  This enables the AT&T  Wireless  Group to offer  customized
billing options and to track billing information per individual cell site, which
is  practical  for advanced  wireless  applications  such as fixed  wireless and
wireless office  applications.  TDMA served an estimated 35 million  subscribers
worldwide and 18 million  subscribers  in North America as of December 31, 1999,

<PAGE>

according to the Universal Wireless Communications Consortium, an association of
TDMA service  providers  and  manufacturers.  TDMA  equipment is available  from
leading  telecommunication  vendors such as Lucent, Ericsson and Nortel Networks
Corporation.  A number of other  wireless  service  providers  have  chosen code
division mobile access (CDMA) or global system for mobile  communications  (GSM)
as their current  digital  wireless  technology.  AT&T Wireless Group intends to
deploy an overlay  of GSM  technology  to its TDMA  network as part of its third
generation  development  strategy,  which will use a different  technology  (see
below).

         CDPD network.  The AT&T Wireless Group's CDPD network  currently covers
104 million POPs, which  represents over 60% of its built network,  and its CDPD
customers  can roam on the CDPD  networks of other  wireless  providers,  which,
together,  cover an  additional 74 million  POPs.  CDPD is an industry  standard
using Internet Protocol, which allows most applications written for the Internet
as well as many  corporate  applications  to run  efficiently  over the  network
without  modification.  Using CDPD, data files and transactions are divided into
small  packets  and  sent  on  a  dedicated  wireless  channel.   In  many  data
applications,  data is sent in bursts with  intermittent  quiet periods.  Packet
transmission  technologies take advantage of this fact and allow user data to be
efficiently carried on the same network channel.  As a result,  relative to data
services carried over circuit-switched  analog or digital wireless networks, the
AT&T  Wireless  Group's  packet-switched  CDPD service is a  significantly  more
cost-effective means of sending data for the majority of applications because it
allows many users to share the same channel.

         Third generation  development strategy.  Third generation  technologies
will allow  carriers to provide  high-speed  wireless  packet data  services and
ultimately voice services using Internet Protocol.  AT&T Wireless Group believes
that a sound third  generation  strategy  should allow the wireless  provider to
achieve a pervasive  footprint quickly and cost effectively.  In addition,  AT&T
Wireless Group believes third generation  networks that achieve global economies
of scale and allow for global  roaming will have a significant  advantage.  AT&T
Wireless Group had originally  chosen TDMA-EDGE as its next generation  wireless
architecture.

         However,  in November 2000,  AT&T Wireless Group  announced that it has
selected for its eventual third generation  services the technological  standard
that is the same global  standard  that has been  selected by service  providers
throughout  Europe,  in Japan and in other  parts of the world.  This  standard,
known as UMTS (for universal mobile  telecommunications  system),  has generally
been  accepted as the  successor  technology  to the second  generation  digital
technology known as GSM. UMTS is also known as W-CDMA, or wideband code division
multiple  access.  Despite the similarity of the acronyms,  CDMA 2000 and W-CDMA
are not  compatible.  To accelerate the  availability  of enhanced data services
offerings, AT&T Wireless Group recently announced plans to deploy a GSM platform
for interim  improvements in wireless data capabilities on the evolutionary path
to  third  generation  services,  as well as  associated  voice  services.  This
platform  will be  deployed  as an  overlay  on  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  second
generation  voice  network.  GSM platform  deployment is planned to begin in the
second half of 2001.  AT&T  Wireless  Group plans to make interim  enhanced data
services  using GPRS  technology  deployed on the GSM network  starting in 2001.
Third  generation EDGE  technology  service is expected to be available in 2002.
AT&T Wireless Group currently  plans to deploy third  generation UMTS technology
beginning  in 2003,  depending  on the  availability  of network  equipment  and
customer devices. By making services on GPRS technology  available in 2001, AT&T
Wireless  Group expects to be able to make  enhanced data services  available to
customers earlier than its originally planned deployment of TDMA-EDGE in 2002.
<PAGE>

         Like AT&T Wireless Group's current packet data network,  the technology
standards AT&T Wireless Group has selected for its enhanced and third generation
data services  strategy are also Internet  Protocol  based.  AT&T Wireless Group
expects that all the  applications  developed and deployed today will migrate to
GPRS-based  and  eventually  to EDGE-based  services as customers  upgrade their
equipment to the new technologies to be deployed.  However,  when deployed using
GPRS and EDGE technologies, these applications are expected to operate at higher
speeds than current systems where deployed. This plan is expected to enable AT&T
Wireless Group to provide customers with earlier availability of a wide range of
data  service  offerings  on a broad  array of devices  (phones,  personal  data
assistants, or PDA's, laptops, etc.). AT&T Wireless Group plans to sell handsets
combining  its  current  TDMA  transmission  technology  and the GSM  technology
platform it plans to deploy with  enhanced  and third  generation  GPRS and EDGE
technologies,  which  would  provide  customers  the  benefit  of access to AT&T
Wireless  Group's  current  voice  network  as  well  as the  new  enhanced  and
high-speed  data  services  when  available.  Industry  specifications  for  the
combined  technology  handsets were jointly developed by the Universal  Wireless
Communications  Consortium  and the North  American GSM Alliance.  AT&T Wireless
Group is in discussions with manufacturers to develop such devices.  In November
2000,  AT&T  announced  nonbinding  letters  of  intent  with  Ericsson,  Lucent
Technologies,  Nokia and Nortel Networks for third generation  network equipment
and, in the case of Nokia and Ericsson,  for future generation wireless customer
terminals.  AT&T Wireless Group began  negotiating  definitive  agreements  with
these and other  vendors  during  the fourth  quarter  of 2000 and has  executed
several of these agreements.

DOCOMO STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

         On January 22,  2001 NTT  DoCoMo,  Inc.,  a leading  Japanese  wireless
communications company,  invested approximately $9.8 billion for shares of a new
class of AT&T preferred stock that are convertible  into  406,255,889  shares of
AT&T Wireless Group  tracking  stock that are intended to reflect  approximately
16% of the financial  performance  and economic value of AT&T Wireless Group. As
part of this investment, DoCoMo also received five-year warrants to purchase the
equivalent of an additional  41,748,273  shares of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking
stock at $35 per share, and DoCoMo and AT&T Wireless Services formed a strategic
alliance  to develop  the next  generation  of mobile  multimedia  services on a
global-standard,  high-speed  wireless network. Of the 406,255,889 AT&T Wireless
Group  tracking stock share  equivalents  issued to DoCoMo,  228,128,307  shares
represented new share equivalents at $27.00 each, and the remaining  178,127,582
share equivalents  represented a reduction of AT&T Common Stock Group's retained
portion of the value of AT&T Wireless  Group at $20.50 each.  Accordingly,  AT&T
Common  Stock  Group  retained  $3,651,615,431  of the  proceeds  of the  DoCoMo
investment and allocated $6,159,464,289 to AT&T Wireless Group.

         The following is a summary of the material provisions of the agreements
among  DoCoMo,  AT&T and AT&T  Wireless  Services,  and the terms of the  DoCoMo
Wireless  Tracking Stock. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of these documents, which have been filed as exhibits to AT&T's
Form 8-K dated December 22, 2000.

         New Class of AT&T Wireless Group Tracking Stock

         DoCoMo  purchased  812,511.778  shares of a new class of AT&T preferred
stock,  par value $1.00,  that we call "DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock." Each
share of DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock is  convertible  at any time into 500
shares  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  and has the same  voting  and
dividend rights as 500 shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.  The DoCoMo

<PAGE>

wireless tracking stock also has some additional rights not available to holders
of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. The following is a description of some of
the rights and features of the DoCoMo wireless tracking stock.

     o    Conversion.  DoCoMo can  convert  all,  and not less than all,  of its
          shares of DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock into AT&T  Wireless  Group
          tracking  stock  at a  ratio  of 500  shares  of AT&T  Wireless  Group
          tracking  stock for each  share of  DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock,
          subject to anti-dilution  protection.  If the split-off occurs,  then,
          immediately  before the  completion  of the  split-off,  each share of
          DoCoMo wireless  tracking stock  automatically  will be converted into
          500  shares  of  AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,   subject  to
          anti-dilution  protection,  and  thereafter  be  exchanged on the same
          terms as all other shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock in the
          split-off.

     o    Liquidation Preference.  The DoCoMo wireless tracking stock carries an
          aggregate  liquidation  preference of $3.65 billion in the event of an
          involuntary  liquidation or dissolution of AT&T, and holders of DoCoMo
          wireless tracking stock are entitled to participate in this preference
          in proportion to the number of shares they hold. The holders of shares
          of  DoCoMo   wireless   tracking   stock  also  will  be  entitled  to
          participate,  on an as-converted basis, in any additional  liquidation
          payments made to holders of AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  less
          any amounts received out of the $3.65 billion liquidation  preference.
          The DoCoMo wireless tracking stock has no preference in the event of a
          voluntary  liquidation or dissolution of AT&T, but automatically would
          convert  into  shares  of  AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  and
          participate  in any  liquidation  payments  made  to  holders  of AT&T
          Wireless Group tracking stock.

     o    Dividends.  Holders of DoCoMo wireless  tracking stock are entitled to
          participate,   on  an   as-converted   basis,   in  any  dividends  or
          distributions paid to holders of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.

     o    Voting Rights.  Holders of DoCoMo wireless tracking stock are entitled
          to vote  together  with  holders  of AT&T  common  shares and not as a
          separate  class.  Each  share of  DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock is
          entitled  to the  number of votes  that could be cast by the shares of
          AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock into which the DoCoMo  wireless
          tracking  stock  is  convertible.  Initially,  each  share  of  DoCoMo
          wireless tracking stock will be entitled to 250 votes.

     o    Redemption  at the Option of AT&T.  There are two  instances  in which
          AT&T may redeem  all,  and not less than all,  of the shares of DoCoMo
          wireless  tracking  stock and  warrants  owned by  DoCoMo at  DoCoMo's
          original  purchase  price plus a  predetermined  rate.  First,  if the
          proposed split-off does not occur before April 26, 2002 and thereafter
          AT&T  redeems  all  AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,  AT&T  may
          concurrently  redeem the DoCoMo wireless tracking stock. In this case,
          if AT&T  announces  a sale of all or  substantially  all the assets of
          AT&T Wireless Group within a year of redemption and then completes the
          sale, DoCoMo will be entitled to receive a payment equal to the excess
          of the value from that sale that would have been  attributable  to the
          DoCoMo wireless tracking stock over the redemption  price.  Second, if
          specified   adverse  tax  events  occur  before  the  split-off   and,
          thereafter,  all AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock is redeemed,  AT&T
          may concurrently redeem the DoCoMo wireless tracking stock on the same

<PAGE>

          terms as described  above.  In either case, if AT&T  splits-off all or
          substantially  all of the assets of AT&T Wireless  Group within a year
          of  redeeming  the DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock,  DoCoMo  will be
          entitled to reinvest  in the spun off entity at the  redemption  price
          and otherwise on terms comparable to those set forth in the agreement.

     o    Transfer.   Shares  of  DoCoMo   wireless   tracking   stock  are  not
          transferable  other  than  by  conversion  into  AT&T  Wireless  Group
          tracking stock or redemption by AT&T.

         Warrants

         DoCoMo  has  acquired  83,496.546  warrants,  each of  which  initially
represents the right to purchase one share of DoCoMo wireless  tracking stock at
an exercise price of $17,500 per share,  or $35 per AT&T Wireless Group tracking
stock share equivalent,  subject to customary anti-dilution  adjustments.  These
warrants  may be  exercised  in any  amount  and at any  time  until  the  fifth
anniversary of the issuance of the warrants.  Upon transfer by DoCoMo to a third
party,  or if DoCoMo  converts  its  DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock into AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock,  each of the warrants will be exercisable for 500
shares of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock at an exercise  price of $35 per
share,  and will no longer be exercisable  for DoCoMo  wireless  tracking stock.
After the split-off, each warrant will be exercisable for 500 shares of the AT&T
Wireless Services common stock at an exercise price of $35 per share, subject to
adjustments   to  reflect  the  exchange   ratio  and  customary   anti-dilution
adjustments.  The warrants are subject to the  transfer  restrictions  described
below.  The shares of DoCoMo  wireless  tracking stock issuable upon exercise of
the warrants,  and any shares of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock into which
they are convertible, will represent new share equivalents.

         DoCoMo Investment Rights and Obligations

         In  addition to the rights  inherent  in the shares of DoCoMo  wireless
tracking  stock,  under  the  agreements,   DoCoMo  has  additional  rights  and
obligations  with respect to its  investment  in AT&T  Wireless  Group that will
continue even if DoCoMo  converts its shares of DoCoMo  wireless  tracking stock
into AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock or if the split-off is completed.

     o    Transfer  Restrictions.   Without  the  consent  of  AT&T  before  the
          split-off,  or AT&T  Wireless  Services  after the  split-off,  for 18
          months following the investment,  DoCoMo may not transfer any warrants
          or any shares of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock or AT&T Wireless
          Services  common  stock  that it  receives  on  conversion  of  DoCoMo
          wireless  tracking  stock,  except if specified  events  occur.  Those
          events are:

          -    a sale  of all or  substantially  all of  AT&T  Wireless  Group's
               assets or business  through merger or other business  combination
               unless  AT&T  Wireless   Group   shareholders   continue  to  own
               two-thirds of the successor corporation;

          -    the acquisition or acquisitions of business or assets, other than
               radio spectrum rights,  by AT&T Wireless Group totaling more than
               $25 billion; or

          -    a tender  offer or exchange  offer  approved  by AT&T's  board of
               directors  or AT&T  Wireless  Services  board  of  directors,  as
               applicable.

         In addition,  subject to a limited  exception,  without  AT&T's or AT&T
Wireless Group's  consent,  as the case may be, DoCoMo may not transfer any AT&T
Wireless  Group  securities to any person if after the transfer the  recipient's
interest  in AT&T  Wireless  would  exceed  6%,  or in the  case of  recipients,
principally financial institutions, who are eligible to report their interest on
Schedule 13G under the Securities Exchange Act, 10%.

         None of DoCoMo's  special rights are  transferable by DoCoMo along with
the shares,  except  that DoCoMo may  transfer  its demand  registration  rights
described below to any transferee of more than $1 billion of AT&T Wireless Group
securities,  and  DoCoMo  may  transfer  one  demand  registration  right  to  a
transferee of the warrants.  Any transfer of registration rights will be subject
to overall  limitations on the registration  rights and will not increase AT&T's
or AT&T Wireless Group's aggregate registration obligations.

          o    Repurchase Obligations.

               -    Failure to complete  split-off  within specified time frame.
                    If the  split-off is not  completed  by January 1, 2002,  or
                    March 15, 2002 if the reason it was not completed by January
                    1,  2002 was  that the  requisite  IRS  ruling  had not been
                    received and AT&T reasonably believes that it is possible to
                    obtain such a ruling by, or effect the  split-off  without a
                    ruling by, March 15, 2002 and is  continuing  to seek such a
                    ruling or to effect  the  split-off  without a ruling,  then
                    DoCoMo  may  require  AT&T  to  repurchase  DoCoMo  wireless
                    tracking stock,  or AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,  and
                    warrants,  that DoCoMo still holds at that time. DoCoMo must
                    exercise this right within 30 days of the January 1 or March
                    15,  2002  trigger  date,   whichever  is  applicable.   The
                    repurchase  price will be DoCoMo's  original  purchase price
                    plus a predetermined  rate. This repurchase  obligation will
                    be  allocated  between  AT&T  and  AT&T  Wireless  Group  in
                    proportion to the  allocation of the proceeds  received from
                    the  investment.  Consequently,  AT&T Wireless Group will be
                    obligated to fund $6.2 billion of the repurchase price, plus
                    interest.  In lieu of receiving this  repurchase  price from
                    AT&T,  DoCoMo  will have the right to cause AT&T to register
                    for  public  sale all of the shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
                    tracking stock  (including  shares that DoCoMo would hold if
                    it exercised its warrants and converted its shares of DoCoMo
                    wireless tracking stock), and thereafter DoCoMo will be able
                    to sell those shares and retain the proceeds  from that sale
                    or sales.

               -    Failure to meet technology  benchmarks within specified time
                    frame. In some  circumstances,  if by June 30, 2004 (1) AT&T
                    Wireless  Group fails to launch  service based on a wireless
                    communications   technology   known  as   universal   mobile
                    telecommunications   systems,   or  wideband  code  division
                    multiple  access,  in at least 13 of the top 50 U.S. markets
                    or (2) abandons  wideband code division  multiple  access as
                    its primary technology for third generation services, DoCoMo
                    may require  AT&T  before the  split-off,  or AT&T  Wireless
                    Services after the split-off, to repurchase the warrants and
                    DoCoMo  wireless  tracking  stock,  or AT&T  Wireless  Group
                    tracking stock, and the warrants that DoCoMo still holds (or
                    the AT&T Wireless Services common stock and related warrants

<PAGE>

                    if post  split-off).  The repurchase  price will be DoCoMo's
                    original  purchase  price plus  interest of a  predetermined
                    rate. Before the split-off,  the repurchase  obligation will
                    be  allocated  between  AT&T  and  AT&T  Wireless  Group  in
                    proportion to the  allocation of the proceeds  received from
                    the  investment,  which was  approximately  $3.6 billion for
                    AT&T and $6.2  billion for AT&T  Wireless  Group.  After the
                    split-off,  if DoCoMo  requires  repayment  because  of AT&T
                    Wireless Group's failure to commence service using an agreed
                    technology as described above,  AT&T Wireless  Services will
                    be  obligated  to fund the entire  amount of the  repurchase
                    obligation,  which is $9.8 billion, plus interest, with AT&T
                    being  secondarily  liable  for  up to  $3.6  billion,  plus
                    interest, if AT&T Wireless Services is unable to satisfy the
                    entire obligation. In lieu of paying all or a portion of the
                    repurchase  price,  AT&T or AT&T Wireless  Services,  as the
                    case may be, will have the right to cause DoCoMo to sell any
                    portion  of its  shares  in a  registered  sale,  and to pay
                    DoCoMo the difference  between the repurchase  price and the
                    proceeds from the registered sales.

               o    Standstill.  Until the fifth  anniversary  of the closing of
                    the investment,  DoCoMo, its controlled  subsidiaries,  when
                    acting on behalf  of  DoCoMo,  its  officers,  directors  or
                    agents,  or any  subsidiary  to which  DoCoMo has  disclosed
                    confidential  information  regarding its  investment may not
                    take a number of actions,  including the following,  without
                    AT&T's   consent  before  the  split-off  or  AT&T  Wireless
                    Services' consent after the split-off:

                    -    acquire or agree to acquire  any voting  securities  of
                         AT&T or AT&T  Wireless  Services,  except in connection
                         with  DoCoMo's  exercise  of  its  preemptive   rights,
                         conversion rights or warrants;

                    -    solicit proxies with respect to AT&T's or AT&T Wireless
                         Services' voting  securities or become a participant in
                         any  election  contest  relating to the election of the
                         directors of AT&T or AT&T Wireless Services;

                    -    call  or seek to  call a  meeting  of the  AT&T or AT&T
                         Wireless   Services    shareholders   or   initiate   a
                         shareholder proposal;

                    -    contest the validity of the standstill in a manner that
                         would lead to public disclosure;

                    -    form or  participate  in a group that would be required
                         to file a  Schedule  13D  with  the  SEC as a  "person"
                         within  the  meaning  of the  Section  13(d)(3)  of the
                         Securities Exchange Act; or

                    -    act in  concert  with any  person  for the  purpose  of
                         electing a transaction that would result in a change of
                         control of AT&T or AT&T Wireless Services.
<PAGE>

         After the fifth year anniversary of the investor agreement, DoCoMo will
continue to be subject to the  standstill for so long as DoCoMo has the right to
nominate  at least one  director.  However,  DoCoMo  will be  released  from the
standstill  91 days  after the  resignations  of all of its  representatives  on
AT&T's and AT&T Wireless  Services' board of directors,  as the case may be, all
of  DoCoMo's  nominated  AT&T  Wireless  Services  committee  members and all of
DoCoMo's nominated management. After these resignations,  AT&T Wireless may take
steps to terminate or sequester all of the other DoCoMo nominated employees.

         If NTT, which owns approximately  two-thirds of DoCoMo, or any of NTT's
subsidiaries  other than  DoCoMo  takes any action  contrary  to the  standstill
restrictions and the action leads to any vote of shareholders of AT&T before the
split-off or AT&T Wireless Services after the split-off, then DoCoMo either must
vote its  shares as the board of  directors  of AT&T or AT&T  Wireless  Services
directs,  or must  vote  its  shares  in  proportion  to the  votes  cast by the
shareholders that are not affiliated with either DoCoMo or NTT. In addition,  if
NTT or any of its  subsidiaries  commences  a  tender  offer  for  AT&T  or AT&T
Wireless  Services  securities,  DoCoMo  cannot  tender or  transfer  any of its
securities  into that offer until all of the  conditions to that offer have been
satisfied.

         The  standstill  provisions  described  above  will  terminate  in  the
following circumstances:

     -    a third party  unaffiliated  with AT&T Wireless  commences a tender or
          exchange offer of 15% of AT&T Wireless  Services'  outstanding  voting
          securities and AT&T Wireless Services does not publicly recommend that
          its shareholders reject to the offer;

     -    AT&T  Wireless  Services  enters into a definitive  agreement to merge
          into or sell all or  substantially  all of its assets to a third party
          unless AT&T Wireless Services  shareholders retain at least 50% of the
          economic and voting power of the surviving corporation; or

     -    AT&T Wireless  Services enters into a definitive  agreement that would
          result in any one person or groups of persons  acquiring more than 35%
          of the voting power of AT&T  Wireless  Services,  unless,  among other
          things, this person or group agrees to a standstill.

         The  standstill  provisions  terminate  with  respect to AT&T two years
after the split-off  (or, if sooner,  upon any of the foregoing  three events as
applied to AT&T).

     o    Registration  Rights.  Subject to certain  exceptions and  conditions,
          DoCoMo is entitled  to require  AT&T  before the  split-off,  and AT&T
          Wireless  Services  after the  split-off,  to register  shares of AT&T
          Wireless Group tracking stock or AT&T Wireless  Services  common stock
          on up to six occasions,  with each demand involving not less than $500
          million worth of shares.  DoCoMo cannot  exercise more than one demand
          right in any seven and a half month period. DoCoMo also is entitled to
          require  AT&T  or AT&T  Wireless  Services,  as the  case  may be,  to
          register  securities  for resale in an unlimited  number of incidental
          registrations, commonly known as piggy-back registrations. DoCoMo will
          cease to be entitled to these registration rights if it owns less than
          $1 billion of AT&T or AT&T Wireless Services  securities,  as the case
          may be,  and  securities  reflecting  less  than  2% of the  financial
          performance and economic value of AT&T Wireless Services.
<PAGE>

     o    Board  Representation.  Until the  split-off,  DoCoMo is  entitled  to
          nominate one  representative to the AT&T board of directors,  and that
          representative  also  will be a  member  of the  AT&T  Wireless  Group
          capital stock committee. After the split-off,  DoCoMo will be entitled
          to nominate a number of  representatives on the AT&T Wireless Services
          board of directors proportional to its economic interest acquired as a
          result of this  investment.  The DoCoMo nominees for these board seats
          must be senior  officers of DoCoMo that are  reasonably  acceptable to
          AT&T or AT&T Wireless  Services,  as the case may be. DoCoMo will lose
          these board  representation  rights if its  economic  interest in AT&T
          Wireless Services falls below 10% for 60 consecutive days. However, as
          long as it retains  62.5% of the shares of its original  investment or
          shares of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock into which such shares
          are convertible, DoCoMo will lose its board representation rights only
          if its economic  interest in AT&T Wireless Services falls below 8% for
          60 consecutive days.

     o    Management Rights. Before the split-off, DoCoMo is entitled to appoint
          one of its senior  executives  that is  reasonably  acceptable to AT&T
          Wireless  Group to AT&T Wireless  Group's senior  leadership  team. In
          addition, subject to AT&T Wireless Group's reasonable approval, DoCoMo
          can appoint between two and five of its employees as employees of AT&T
          Wireless  Group,   including  the   Manager-Finance  and  Director  of
          Technology. DoCoMo will lose these rights under the same circumstances
          as it would lose board representation rights.

     o    Right to Approve Specified Actions. Before the split-off, AT&T may not
          take any of the following actions without DoCoMo's prior approval:

          -    sell all or substantially all of AT&T Wireless Group's assets;

          -    sell all or  substantially  all of AT&T Wireless Group's business
               through  merger  or  other  business  combination,   unless  AT&T
               Wireless Group  shareholders  retain  two-thirds of the successor
               corporation;

          -    acquire  business or assets for AT&T Wireless  Group,  other than
               radio spectrum rights, in excess of $17 billion;

          -    subject to some exceptions,  issue any further economic interests
               or  rights to AT&T  Wireless  over 15% of AT&T  Wireless  Group's
               market capitalization as of the date of the letter agreement;

          -    subject to some  exceptions,  pay cash dividends to or repurchase
               AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock;

          -    amend AT&T's charter or by-laws so that the rights of the holders
               of DoCoMo wireless tracking stock would be adversely affected; or

          -    change the  split-off  related  agreements  so that AT&T Wireless
               Services  would be  materially  adversely  affected or enter into
               new, material contracts among affiliated parties that do not have
               arm's-length terms.

         After the  split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Services may not take any of the
following actions without DoCoMo's prior approval:
<PAGE>

          -    change the scope of its business such that AT&T Wireless  Group's
               businesses  (including  those  in its  business  plan)  cease  to
               constitute the primary businesses of AT&T Wireless Services; or

          -    enter into a strategic alliance with another wireless operator so
               that the wireless  operator would own more than 15% but less than
               50% of the economic interest in AT&T Wireless Services.

         DoCoMo will lose these approval rights under the same  circumstances as
it would lose board representation rights.

          o    Preemptive  Rights.  DoCoMo has  limited  preemptive  rights that
               entitle it to  maintain  its  ownership  interest  by  purchasing
               shares  in some new  equity  issuances  by AT&T or AT&T  Wireless
               Services.  In the  event  of a new  equity  issuance  of the type
               covered by the preemptive right, then:

               -    if DoCoMo holds 12% or more of the economic interest of AT&T
                    Wireless  Services at the time of the new  issuance,  DoCoMo
                    may purchase a number of additional  shares that would bring
                    DoCoMo's economic interest back up to 16%; and

               -    if DoCoMo  holds less than 12% of the  economic  interest of
                    AT&T  Wireless  Services  at the  time of the new  issuance,
                    DoCoMo may purchase a number of additional shares that would
                    maintain  DoCoMo's  economic interest at the level it was at
                    just before the new issuance.

         In most cases, the purchase price for these  additional  shares will be
the  issuance  price.  DoCoMo will lose these  preemptive  rights under the same
circumstances as it would lose board representation rights.

         Strategic Alliance

         In connection  with  DoCoMo's  investment,  AT&T Wireless  Services and
DoCoMo  formed a strategic  alliance to develop  the next  generation  of mobile
multimedia  services on a  global-standard,  high-speed  wireless network.  AT&T
Wireless  Services  will create a new,  wholly owned  subsidiary  to develop and
encourage the development of multimedia content,  applications and services able
to be offered over AT&T Wireless  Services' current network,  as well as on new,
high-speed  wireless  networks  built to global  standards for third  generation
services. AT&T Wireless Services will contribute, among other things, its rights
to content and applications used in its PocketNet services to the new multimedia
subsidiary.  Both AT&T  Wireless  Services and DoCoMo plan to provide  technical
resources and support staffing. In addition, AT&T Wireless Services will be able
to license from DoCoMo,  without additional payment,  certain rights to DoCoMo's
"i-mode"   service,   which  provides  access  to  the  Internet  from  wireless
telephones, and related technology.

         The  strategic  alliance is  expected  to enable each of AT&T  Wireless
Services and DoCoMo to offer  market-appropriate  wireless services to customers
throughout  the United  States and Japan,  respectively.  In addition,  each has
agreed, subject to technical and commercial feasibility,  to recognize the other
as its  primary  and  preferred  roaming  partner  in  the  other  party's  home
territory.

         AT&T and AT&T  Wireless  Services  on the one hand,  and  DoCoMo on the
other hand,  have agreed to certain  non-competition  commitments  that restrict

<PAGE>

each other's ability to provide mobile wireless services in Japan and the United
States, respectively. They have also agreed to limit the extent to which AT&T or
AT&T Wireless  Services on the one hand,  and DoCoMo on the other hand,  will be
able to participate in certain mobile  multimedia  activities and investments in
each other's home territory.  Any such restrictions on AT&T would terminate upon
the earlier of a split-off  of AT&T  Wireless  Services or exercise by DoCoMo of
any put,  liquidation or registration right as a result of the non-occurrence of
such a split-off.  AT&T Wireless  Services and DoCoMo will generally be bound by
the non-competition  commitments until DoCoMo loses its board representation and
management  rights,  either due to any of the  events  described  under  "DoCoMo
Investment Rights and Obligations - Board Representation" and "DoCoMo Investment
Rights and Obligations  -Management Rights", or due to voluntary  relinquishment
of such rights by DoCoMo.

                  On June 1,  1999,  AT&T  Canada  Corp.  merged  with  MetroNet
Communications Corp., Canada's largest competitive local exchange carrier. Under
the terms of the  merger  agreement,  AT&T  received  31  percent  of the equity
interest  and 23  percent  of the  voting  interest  in the  combined  entity in
exchange for AT&T Canada Corp.  and ACC  TelEnterprises  Ltd. In addition,  AT&T

<PAGE>

agreed  to  purchase  all of the  remaining  shares at the  greater  of the then
appraised fair market value or the accreted  minimum price,  which  initially is
C$37.50  accreting  after June 30,  2000 at a rate of 16% per annum,  compounded
quarterly.  If the acquisition is not completed by June 30, 2003,  those shares,
along with AT&T's shares, would be sold through an auction process and AT&T will
make whole the other  shareholders  for the amount they would have been entitled
to if AT&T had  purchased  the shares.  The  completion  of the  acquisition  is
subject to the  condition  that AT&T is  permitted  to acquire the shares  under
Canada's foreign ownership restrictions.  AT&T may acquire the shares prior to a
change in the ownership  restrictions  by developing a structure  that addresses
such ownership  restrictions.  On August 16, 1999, AT&T completed its sale to BT
of 30% of AT&T's  stake in AT&T Canada.  In addition,  BT has agreed to purchase
30% of the shares AT&T will be acquiring from the other stockholders, subject to
BT's right to cap its purchase at $1.65 billion.

         On August 28, 2000, AT&T established AT&T Latin America,  in connection
with the merger of Netstream,  a competitive  local exchange  company in Brazil,
and FirstCom,  a publicly  traded  company with  competitive  telecommunications
operations  in Chile,  Colombia  and Peru.  AT&T owns 58  percent  of AT&T Latin
America;  SL  Participacoes,  an  affiliate of Promon  Tecnologia,  which is the
former owner of Netstream,  owns 7 percent of AT&T Latin America, and the former
FirstCom  shareholders own 34 percent of AT&T Latin America,  on a fully diluted
basis.  Promon  Tecnologia  and the  former  FirstCom  shareholders  own Class A
shares,  and have one vote per  share;  AT&T owns  Class B shares,  and have ten
votes per share.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

         Telecommunications Act of 1996

         In  February   1996,  the   Telecommunications   Act  became  law.  The
Telecommunications  Act,  among  other  things,  was  designed  to foster  local
exchange  competition  by  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  to govern new
competitive entry in local and long distance  telecommunications  services.  The
Telecommunications Act will permit the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs)
to provide  interexchange  services originating in any state in its region after
demonstrating  to the FCC that such  provision  is in the  public  interest  and
satisfying the conditions for developing  local  competition  established by the
Telecommunications Act.

         In  August  1996,  the FCC  adopted  rules and  regulations,  including
pricing  rules  (the  "Pricing  Rules")  to  implement  the  local   competition
provisions of the  Telecommunications  Act,  including with respect to the terms
and conditions of interconnection  with LEC networks and the standards governing
the purchase of unbundled  network  elements and  wholesale  services from LECs.
These  implementing  rules rely on state public utilities  commissions (PUCs) to
develop the specific rates and procedures applicable to particular states within
the framework prescribed by the FCC.

         On July 18,  1997,  the United  States  Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit  issued a decision  holding  that the FCC lacks  authority  to establish
pricing rules to implement the sections of the local  competition  provisions of
the  Telecommunications  Act applicable to interconnection with LEC networks and
the purchase of unbundled  network  elements and  wholesale  services from LECs.
Accordingly,  the Court  vacated  the rules  that the FCC had  adopted in August
1996,  and which had been stayed by the Court since  September  1996. On October
14,  1997,  the Eigth  Circuit  Court of  Appeals  vacated  an FCC Rule that had
prohibited  incumbent LECs from separating network elements that are combined in

<PAGE>

the LEC's  network,  except at the  request  of the  competitor  purchasing  the
elements.  This  decision  increased  the  difficulty  and  costs  of  providing
competitive  local  service  through  the  use  of  unbundled  network  elements
purchased from the incumbent LECs.

         On January 25, 1999,  the Unites States Supreme Court issued a decision
reversing  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court of  Appeal's  holding  that the FCC lacks
jurisdiction to establish  pricing rules applicable to  interconnection  and the
purchase of unbundled  network  elements,  and the Court of Appeal's decision to
vacate  the  FCC's  rule  prohibiting  incumbent  LECs from  separating  network
elements  that are  combined  in the LEC's  network.  The effect of the  Supreme
Court's  decision was to  reinstate  the FCC's rules  governing  pricing and the
separation of unbundled network elements.  The pricing issues were then remanded
to the Eighth  Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the  incumbent  LECs' claims
that  although the FCC has  jurisdiction  to adopt pricing  rules,  the rules it
adopted  are not  consistent  with the  applicable  provisions  of the Act.  The
Supreme Court also vacated the FCC's rule identifying and defining the unbundled
network  elements  that  incumbent  LECs are  required to make  available to new
entrants, and directed the FCC to reexamine this issue in light of the standards
mandated by the Act.

         In response to the Supreme  Court's  decision,  the FCC  completed  its
re-examination  of and released an order  identifying and defining the unbundled
network  elements  that  incumbent  LECs are  required to make  available to new
entrants.  That order  re-adopted  the original  list of elements,  with certain
exceptions. An association of incumbent LECs has appealed the FCC's order to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit,  and asked
the  Court to hear the  appeal  on an  expedited  basis.  A number  of  parties,
including AT&T and other  incumbent  LECs, have petitioned the FCC to reconsider
and/or  clarify  its  order.  The FCC has moved to hold the  appeal in  abeyance
pending its disposition of the reconsideration petitions.

         In July 2000,  the Eighth  Circuit  issued a  decision  addressing  the
incumbent  LECs' claims that the FCC's pricing rules are not consistent with the
applicable  provisions of the Act. It rejected the  incumbent  LECs' claims that
the prices for network elements must be based on their "historical costs" rather
than, as the FCC had held, their "forward looking" costs. It also held, however,
that the FCC rule providing that  forward-looking  costs should be calculated on
the basis of the cost of the most  efficient  alternatives  was  contrary to the
Act.  The Eighth  Circuit  then stayed this ruling to enable the parties to seek
review before the Supreme  Court,  so the FCC's rules remain in effect until the
Supreme  Court  decides  the case.  The  Supreme  Court has agreed to review the
Eighth Circuit's decision, and a decision by the Supreme Court is anticipated by
the end of June 2002.  The Supreme Court will be  considering  both the claim of
AT&T, the FCC, and others that the Eighth Circuit erred by invalidating  the FCC
rule,  and the claim by the incumbent  LECs that the Eighth Circuit erred by not
requiring prices based on their historical cost.

         The Eighth Circuit also invalidated the FCC's rules setting the pricing
methodology  for resold  local  services.  That aspect of its  decision  was not
stayed, and will not be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

         In view of the  proceedings  pending before the Supreme  Court,  the DC
Circuit, FCC and state PUCs, there can be no assurance that the prices and other
conditions  established  in each state will provide for effective  local service
entry and competition or provide AT&T with new market opportunities.  The effect
of the most  recent  decision by the Eighth  Circuit is to  increase  the risks,
costs, difficulties, and uncertainty of entering local markets through using the

<PAGE>

incumbent  LECs'  facilities  and  services.   Notwithstanding  its  substantial
efforts,  AT&T  continues to experience  significant  difficulty  entering local
markets.  AT&T's ability to purchase  combined  network elements from the ILECs,
one of the  primary  methods  AT&T  intends to use to provide  local  service to
residential  customers,  continued  to be  severely  hampered  by,  among  other
factors,  ILEC-sponsored  regulatory and judicial actions, and lack of operating
interfaces  necessary  to process  network  element  orders with ILECs.  Despite
strong customer demand for competitive choice in local markets outside of AT&T's
cable footprint, AT&T has suspended sales of resold local service, and continues
to provide network element non  facilities-based  local service only in New York
and Texas.  AT&T will  continue  its  regulatory  efforts  to improve  operating
margins in the states where it offers  non-facilities-based  local services, and
will seek to open other states to competitive  opportunities (both for voice and
data  services) by improving  the rates,  rules and  operating  interfaces  that
govern carrier relationships.

         In December  1999,  Bell Atlantic (now  Verizon)  obtained  approval to
offer long distance telecommunications service in New York state, the first time
an RBOC had  received  this  approval  under the  Telecommunications  Act.  Bell
Atlantic  began  offering  combined  local and long distance  service in January
2000. In July 2000, SBC  Communications,  Inc. became the second RBOC to receive
such approval,  this time for the state of Texas,  and began providing  combined
local and long distance  service in July 2000. In January 2001, the FCC approved
SBC  Communications'  request for such  authority for the states of Oklahoma and
Kansas,  and pursuant to the terms of that  authority  SBC will be free to begin
providing  combined  local and long  distance  services in those states in March
2001.  In  January  2001,  Verizon  filed an  application  with the FCC for such
authority for the state of  Massachusetts.  This is Verizon's  second filing for
the state of  Massachusetts,  and the FCC is required to issue a decision on the
application in April 2001.

         Regulation of Rates

         AT&T  is  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of the  FCC  with  respect  to
interstate and international rates, lines and services,  and other matters. From
July 1989 to October 1995, the FCC regulated AT&T under a system known as "price
caps" whereby AT&T's prices, rather than its earnings,  were limited. On October
12, 1995,  recognizing a decade of enormous  change in the long distance  market
and finding  that AT&T  lacked  market  power in the  interstate  long  distance
market,  the FCC reclassified AT&T as a "non-dominant"  carrier for its domestic
interstate services. As a result, AT&T became subject to the same regulations as
its long  distance  competitors  for such  services.  Thus,  AT&T was no  longer
subject to price cap  regulation  for these  services,  was able to file tariffs
that are presumed lawful on one day's notice,  and was free of other regulations
and reporting requirements that apply only to dominant carriers.

                  In addition, on October 31, 1996, the FCC issued an order that
would have prohibited non-dominant carriers, including AT&T, from filing tariffs
for their domestic interstate services.  Non-dominant carriers,  including AT&T,
have begun  implementation  of  mechanisms  other than tariffs to establish  the
terms and  conditions  that  apply to  domestic,  interstate  telecommunications
services,  and by August 1, 2001 will have to use such  mechanisms for virtually
all domestic,  interstate  telecommunications  services.  In March 2001, the FCC
adopted an order applying detariffing requirements to international services.

                  Furthermore,  in  May  1997,  the  FCC  adopted  three  orders
relating to Price Caps, Access Reform,  and Universal Service that substantially
revised the level and  structure of access  charges that AT&T as a long distance

<PAGE>

carrier pays to incumbent LECs. Under the Price Cap Order, LECs were required to
reduce their price cap indices by 6.5 percent  annually,  less an adjustment for
inflation,  which has resulted in significant  reductions in access charges that
long distance companies pay to LECs. The Access Reform Order permitted increased
flat-rate  assessments  to  multiline  business  customers  and  to  residential
customers  other than for the primary  telephone  line.  AT&T has agreed to pass
through to  consumers  any  savings to AT&T as a result of these  access  charge
reforms. Consequently,  AT&T's results after June 1997 reflect lower revenue per
minute of usage and lower access and other  interconnection  costs per minute of
usage.

                  In May 2000, the FCC adopted the CALLS Order for the price cap
LECs which made additional  significant access and price cap changes.  The CALLS
Order reduced by $3.2 billion  during 2000 the  interstate  access  charges that
AT&T and other  long  distance  carriers  pay to these  LECs for access to their
networks,  and established  target access rates for these companies,  which over
the next two years will result in further  reductions,  albeit of a much smaller
magnitude.  Once the  target  rates are  reached,  the annual  price  reductions
required by the Price Cap Order no longer  apply.  In addition,  the CALLS Order
removed  implicit  subsidies  from  access  charges and  converted  them into an
explicit, portable subsidy administered as part of the universal service program
described below. Also, under CALLS, the caps on certain line-based costs that do
not vary with usage have been  increased  so that these  costs are  increasingly
recovered from end user customers. These restructurings allowed the reduction in
access charges  assessed on long distance  carriers on a usage basis. As part of
the  CALLS  Order,  AT&T  agreed  to  flowthrough  to  customers  access  charge
reductions  over the  five-year  life of the CALLS plan and made  certain  other
commitments  regarding the rate structure of certain  residential  long distance
offerings.

                  Under the August 1999 LEC Pricing Flexibility Order, which was
affirmed  by the D.C.  Circuit in February  2001,  the FCC  established  certain
triggers that enable the price cap LECs to obtain pricing  flexibility for their
interstates  access  services,  including  Phase II relief that  permits them to
remove  these  services  from  price cap  regulation.  Although  these  triggers
supposedly  indicate a competitive  presence  sufficient  to constrain  monopoly
pricing by the LECs, in fact,  they may allow for premature  deregulation  which
could force access rates upwards.

                  Finally, in the Universal Service Order, the FCC adopted a new
mechanism for funding universal service, which includes programs that defray the
costs of telephone service in high-cost areas, for low-income consumers, and for
schools,  libraries  and rural  health  care  providers.  Specifically,  the FCC
expanded the set of carriers that must contribute to support  universal  service
from only long distance  carriers to all carriers,  including LECs, that provide
interstate  telecommunications services. Similarly, the set of carriers eligible
for the  universal  service  support  has been  expanded  from  only LECs to any
eligible carrier providing local service to a customer,  including AT&T as a new
entrant in local markets.  The Universal  Service Order also adopted measures to
provide  discounts on  telecommunications  services,  Internet access and inside
wire to for eligible  schools and libraries and on  telecommunications  services
only for rural health care providers.

         AT&T remains  subject to the statutory  requirements of Title II of the
Communications  Act. AT&T must offer service under rates,  terms and  conditions
that are just, reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory;  it is subject to
the FCC's  complaint  process,  and it must give notice to the FCC and  affected
customers  prior  to  discontinuance,   reduction,  or  impairment  of  service.

<PAGE>

Commitments  made by  AT&T to  address  concerns  that  had  been  raised  about
declaring AT&T to be non-dominant have been satisfied or otherwise expired.

         In  addition  to  the  matters  described  above  with  respect  to the
Telecommunications  Act, state public service commissions or similar authorities
having  regulatory  power over  intrastate  rates,  lines and services and other
matters regulate AT&T's local and intrastate communications services. The system
of regulation used in many states is rate-of-return regulation. In recent years,
many states have adopted  different  systems of  regulation,  such as:  complete
removal of rate-of-return regulation,  pricing flexibility rules, price caps and
incentive regulation.

         Wireless Regulatory Environment

         The FCC regulates the licensing, construction,  operation, acquisition,
sale and  resale of  wireless  systems  in the  United  States  pursuant  to the
Communications  Act of 1934 and the associated  rules,  regulations and policies
promulgated  by  the  FCC.  FCC  terminology  distinguishes  between  "cellular"
licenses, which utilize a frequency of 850 megahertz, and ""PCS" licenses, which
utilize a frequency of 1900 megahertz. The different types of licenses and their
associated systems may have differing technical characteristics.

         Licensing of wireless services systems

         AT&T Wireless  Group owns  protected  geographic  service area licenses
granted by the FCC to provide  cellular  service and PCS. It also owns  licenses
granted by the FCC to provide  point-to-multi-point  communications  services in
various bands, including significant licenses in the 37 to 39 gigahertz bands.

         A cellular system operates on one of two 25 megahertz  frequency blocks
that the FCC allocates for cellular radio service.  Cellular  systems  generally
are used for two-way  mobile voice  applications,  although they may be used for
data  applications and fixed wireless  services as well.  Cellular license areas
are  issued  for  either  metropolitan  service  areas or rural  service  areas.
Initially,  one of the two  cellular  licenses  available  in each  metropolitan
service  area or rural  service area was awarded to a local  exchange  telephone
company  by the  FCC,  while  the  other  license  was  awarded  either  through
competitive processes or lotteries.  Licenses were issued beginning in 1983, and
over the years numerous  license  transfers and corporate  reorganizations  have
obscured  the  original  pattern of  distributing  one set of  licenses to local
telephone  company  affiliates and the other to companies that do not have local
exchange service in the license area.

         A PCS system  operates on one of six  frequency  blocks  allocated  for
personal  communications  services.  PCS systems  generally are used for two-way
voice applications  although they may carry two-way data communications as well.
For the purpose of  awarding  PCS  licenses,  the FCC has  segmented  the United
States into 51 large regions called major trading areas,  which are comprised of
493 smaller regions called basic trading areas. The FCC awarded two PCS licenses
for each major trading area and four  licenses for each basic trading area.  The
two major trading area  licenses  authorize the use of 30 megahertz of spectrum.
One of the basic trading area licenses is for 30 megahertz of spectrum,  and the
other three are for 10 megahertz each. The FCC permits  licensees to split their
licenses  and assign a portion,  on either a geographic  or  frequency  basis or
both, to a third party.

         The FCC awarded  initial PCS licenses by auction.  Auctions  began with
the 30 megahertz major trading area licenses and concluded in 1998 with the last
of the basic trading area licenses.  However,  in March 1998, the FCC adopted an

<PAGE>

order that  allowed  financially  troubled  entities  that won PCS 30  megahertz
C-Block  licenses  at  auction to obtain  financial  relief  from their  payment
obligations  and to return some or all of their C-Block  licenses to the FCC for
reauctioning.  The FCC completed the reauction of the returned licenses in April
1999. In addition,  certain of the C-block  licenses are currently in bankruptcy
proceedings.  The FCC  cancelled  some of  these  licenses,  and  completed  the
reauction  of the  licenses  in  January  2001.  The FCC's  cancellation  of the
licenses has been challenged by one of the bankrupt  licensees,  and there is no
guarantee  that the  reauction  or the  award of any  licenses  pursuant  to the
reauction will not be affected by this challenge.

         Under the FCC's current spectrum  aggregation rules, no entity may hold
attributable interests, generally 20% or more of the equity of, or an officer or
director position with, the licensee,  in licenses for more than 45 megahertz of
PCS,  cellular  and certain  specialized  mobile radio  services  where there is
significant overlap in any geographic area.  Significant overlap will occur when
at least 10% of the  population  of the PCS licensed  service area is within the
cellular  and/or  specialized  mobile radio  service  area(s).  The FCC recently
increased this limit to 55 megahertz for rural areas. These spectrum aggregation
rules are subject to a pending FCC  proceeding  that could  revise or  eliminate
them.

         All wireless  licenses  have a 10-year  term,  at the end of which term
they must be  renewed.  The FCC will  award a renewal  expectancy  to a wireless
licensee that has provided substantial service during its past license term, and
has  substantially  complied  with  applicable  FCC rules and  policies  and the
Communications  Act.  Licenses  may be  revoked  for cause and  license  renewal
applications  denied if the FCC  determines  that a renewal  would not serve the
public  interest.  FCC rules provide that  competing  renewal  applications  for
licenses  will  be  considered  in  comparative  hearings,   and  establish  the
qualifications  for  competing  applications  and the standards to be applied in
hearings.

         All wireless  licenses must satisfy  specified  coverage  requirements.
Cellular  licenses were required,  during the five years  following the grant of
the  initial  license,  to  construct  their  systems to provide  service  (at a
specified signal  strength) to the territory  encompassed by their service area.
Failure to provide such coverage  resulted in reduction of the relevant  license
area by the FCC. All A, B and C block PCS licensees  must  construct  facilities
that offer  coverage to one-third of the  population  of the service area within
five years of the initial  license  grants and to two-thirds  of the  population
within ten years.  All D, E and F block PCS licensees must construct  facilities
that offer  coverage to  one-fourth  of the  population  of the licensed area or
"make a showing of substantial  service in their license area" within five years
of the original license grants.  Other  point-to-multi-point  licenses require a
showing of  substantial  service  at  renewal.  Licensees  that fail to meet the
coverage requirements may be subject to forfeiture of the license.

         In an effort to balance the competing  interests of existing  microwave
users in the PCS bands and newly authorized PCS licensees, the FCC has adopted a
transition  plan to relocate such microwave  operators to other spectrum  blocks
and a cost sharing plan so that if the relocation of an incumbent  benefits more
than one PCS licensee,  those  licensees will share the cost of the  relocation.
The transition period contemplates  negotiations between microwave licensees and
PCS  licensees  to  accomplish  the  transition  and to  govern  the  terms  and
conditions  of the  transition  of microwave  licensees  from the PCS  spectrum.
Generally,  there is a "voluntary"  negotiation  period  during which  incumbent
microwave  licensees can, but do not have to negotiate with PCS licensees.  This
is followed by a "mandatory" negotiation period during which incumbent microwave
licensees must negotiate in good faith with PCS licensees.
<PAGE>

         Wireless  systems are subject to certain FAA regulations  governing the
location,  lighting and construction of transmitter  towers and antennas and are
subject  to  regulation   under  federal   environmental   laws  and  the  FCC's
environmental  regulations.  State or local zoning and land use regulations also
apply to tower  siting  and  construction  activities.  We expect to use  common
carrier  point-to-point  microwave  facilities to connect certain  wireless cell
sites,  and to link them to the main  switching  office.  The FCC licenses these
facilities  separately  and they  are  subject  to  regulation  as to  technical
parameters and service.

         The Communications Act preempts state and local regulation of the entry
of, or the rates charged by, any provider of private  mobile radio service or of
commercial mobile radio service,  which includes PCS and cellular  service.  The
FCC does not regulate  commercial  mobile radio service or private  mobile radio
service rates.  However,  commercial  mobile radio service  providers are common
carriers and are required under the  Communications  Act to offer their services
to the public without  unreasonable  discrimination.  The FCC's rules  currently
require  providers  to  permit  others to resell  their  services  for a profit;
however, these rules will expire in 2002.

         Transfers and assignments of spectrum licenses

         Except for transfers of control or assignments  that are considered pro
forma, the Communications Act and FCC rules require the FCC's prior approval for
the  assignment  of a license or transfer of control of a licensee  for a PCS or
cellular system and other types of wireless licenses.  In addition,  the FCC has
established  transfer disclosure  requirements that require licensees who assign
or  transfer  control of a PCS  license  within the first  three  years of their
license terms to file associated sale contracts,  option agreements,  management
agreements  or other  documents  disclosing  the  total  consideration  that the
licensee  would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license.
Non-controlling  interests in an entity that holds an FCC license  generally may
be bought or sold without FCC approval subject to the FCC's spectrum aggregation
limits.  However,  notification  and  expiration or earlier  termination  of the
applicable  waiting  period  under  Section 7A of the  Clayton Act by either the
Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice may be required if we sell
or acquire interests over a certain size.  Approval by state or local regulatory
authorities  having  competent   jurisdiction  may  also  be  required  in  some
circumstances.

         Foreign ownership

         Under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee's capital stock
may be owned,  directly or  indirectly,  or voted by non-U.S.  citizens or their
representatives,  by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign
corporation.  If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity, as is the case
with our ownership  structure,  up to 25% of that entity's  capital stock may be
owned or voted by  non-U.S.  citizens  or their  representatives,  by a  foreign
government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership
above the 25% level may be  allowed  should the FCC and such  higher  levels not
inconsistent  with the public interest.  The FCC has ruled that higher levels of
foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public
interest  with  respect  to  investors  from  certain  nations.  If our  foreign
ownership  were to exceed  the  permitted  level,  the FCC could  revoke our FCC
licenses,  although we could seek a declaratory ruling from the FCC allowing the
foreign  ownership  or take  other  actions  to  reduce  our  foreign  ownership
percentage in order to avoid the loss of our  licenses.  We have no knowledge of
any present foreign ownership in violation of these restrictions.

         Recent regulatory developments

         The FCC has announced rules for making emergency 911 services available
by cellular, PCS and other commercial mobile radio service providers,  including
enhanced 911 services that provide the caller's  telephone number,  location and
other useful information. Commercial mobile radio service providers are required
to  take  actions   enabling   them  to  relay  a  caller's   automatic   number
identification  and  location  (initially  the  location  of the cell site first
transmitting the call, and ultimately by an approximation of the caller's actual
location) if requested to do so by a public safety  dispatch  agency.  Providers
may  use  either   network  or   handset-based   technologies   to  provide  the
approximation  of the caller's  actual  location.  There is no requirement  that
dispatch  agencies   reimburse  provider  for  their  costs  of  deploying  such
technologies. 911 service must be made available to users with speech or hearing
disabilities,  but this  requirement  does not  apply to  providers  of  digital
wireless  services until 2002.  Finally,  wireless handsets capable of receiving
analog  signals  must be able to complete 911 calls using the  strongest  analog
signal  available  to the caller,  even if the caller does not  subscribe to the
carrier providing the strongest signal.  State actions incompatible with the FCC
rules are subject to preemption by the FCC.

         On  August  8,  1996,  the FCC  released  its  order  implementing  the
interconnection  provisions of the Telecommunications  Act. Although many of the
provisions  of this order were struck down by the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit,  on January 25, 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Eighth
Circuit and upheld the FCC in all respects  material to our operations.  On June
10, 1999, the Eighth Circuit issued an order requesting briefs on certain issues
it did not  address in its  earlier  order,  including  the  pricing  regime for
interconnection.  While  appeals have been  pending,  the rationale of the FCC's
order has been  adopted by many states'  public  utility  commissions,  with the
result that the charges that  cellular  and PCS  operators  pay to  interconnect
their  traffic  to  the  public   switched   telephone   network  have  declined
significantly  from pre-1996  levels.  In July 2000, the Eighth Circuit rejected
certain aspects of the FCC's pricing  methodology,  but stayed its order pending
appeal by affected parties to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court has
agreed to review this case.

         In  its   implementation  of  the   Telecommunications   Act,  the  FCC
established federal universal service requirements that affect commercial mobile
radio service operators.  Under the FCC's rules, commercial mobile radio service
providers are potentially  eligible to receive  universal  service subsidies for
the first time;  however,  they are also  required to  contribute to the federal
universal  service  fund and can be required to  contribute  to state  universal
funds.  Many states are moving forward to develop state  universal  service fund
programs. A number of these state funds require  contributions,  varying greatly
from state to state, from commercial mobile radio service  providers.  The FCC's
universal  service order was modified on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit.  The court's ruling has had the effect of reducing commercial
mobile  radio  service  provider  support  payments  required  for  the  federal
universal  service  programs.  The U.S.  Supreme Court has agreed to address the
constitutionality  of the FCC's  universal  service  order,  in particular as it
affects the amount of funds to which  telephone  companies  are entitled to help
defray the costs of providing basic telephone service. The Court's determination
may also affect the FCC's interconnection pricing methodology.

         On August 1, 1996,  the FCC released a report and order  expanding  the
flexibility of cellular, PCS and other commercial mobile radio service providers
to provide fixed as well as mobile services.  These fixed services include,  but

<PAGE>

need not be limited to, wireless local loop services,  for example, to apartment
and office buildings, and wireless backup services to private branch exchange or
switchboards  and local area networks,  to be used in the event of interruptions
due to weather or other  emergencies.  If the fixed  services are provided as an
ancillary  service to a carrier's  mobility  services,  the FCC has decided that
such fixed services should be regulated as commercial mobile radio services. The
FCC declined to render a prospective  ruling on how fixed services provided on a
co-primary basis with mobility services should be regulated or if they should be
subjected  to  universal  service  obligations.  Rather,  it has  announced  its
intention  to decide  such  matters on a  case-by-case  basis  depending  on the
characteristics  of a  provider's  fixed  service  offering.  The FCC  has  been
presented  with one such case,  but has not yet ruled on it. It is unclear  what
effect, if any, such a ruling would have on the business of AT&T Wireless Group.

         The FCC has adopted  rules on telephone  number  portability  that will
enable  customers to migrate their  landline and cellular  telephone  numbers to
cellular or PCS providers and from a cellular or PCS provider to another service
provider. On February 8, 1999, the FCC extended the deadline for compliance with
this requirement to November 24, 2002,  subject to any later  determination that
number portability is necessary to conserve telephone numbers.  The FCC has also
adopted rules requiring  cellular and PCS providers to provide certain functions
to facilitate  electronic  surveillance by law enforcement officials by June 30,
2000. Carriers must be able to provide additional  surveillance  capabilities by
September 30, 2001.  AT&T Wireless  Group has sought  permission  for a flexible
deployment schedule from the FCC. The FCC has not ruled on the request and there
can be no assurance that the FCC will grant the request. In addition,  in August
2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit invalidated
some of these  rules and  remanded  them to the FCC for  further  consideration.
Various other petitions are pending before the FCC seeking suspension or further
extensions of the deadlines applicable to providing  surveillance  capabilities.
It is not known how the FCC will  revise  its rules or  whether  it will  extend
either or both of the  compliance  deadlines or what the scope of penalties  for
failing to comply may be.

         In 1997, the FCC determined  that the rate  integration  requirement of
the  Communications  Act applies to the  interstate,  interexchange  services of
commercial mobile radio service providers.  Rate integration  requires a carrier
to provide  service  between the  continental  U.S. and offshore U.S. states and
territories  under the same rate  structure  applicable  to service  between two
points  in the  continental  U.S.  The FCC  delayed  implementation  of the rate
integration  requirements  with respect to wide area rate plans we offer pending
further  reconsideration  of its rules.  The FCC also delayed the requirement to
integrate  commercial  mobile radio service long distance rates among commercial
mobile radio service  affiliates.  On December 31, 1998, the FCC reaffirmed,  on
reconsideration,   that  its  interexchange  rate  integration  rules  apply  to
interexchange  commercial  mobile radio service  services.  The FCC announced it
would initiate a further  proceeding to determine how  integration  requirements
apply to typical commercial mobile radio service  offerings,  including one-rate
plans.  In July 2000,  the U.S.  Court of Appeals  for the  District of Columbia
Circuit  reversed the FCC's holding that the  Communications  Act  unambiguously
extends rate integration to providers of commercial  mobile services.  The court
remanded the matter to the FCC for further consideration.  Pending conclusion of
this further  proceeding,  the rate  integration  requirement  does not apply to
commercial  mobile services.  To the extent that AT&T Wireless Group is required
to offer  services  subject  to the FCC's  rate  integration  requirements,  its
pricing  flexibility  will be  reduced.  We cannot  assure you that the FCC will
decline  to impose  rate  integration  requirements  on AT&T  Wireless  Group or
decline to require it to integrate  its  commercial  mobile  radio  service long
distance rates across its commercial mobile radio service affiliates.
<PAGE>

         In  1998,  the FCC  adopted  new  rules  limiting  the use of  customer
proprietary  network information by  telecommunications  carriers in marketing a
broad range of telecommunications  and other services to their customers and the
customers of affiliated companies.  The rules were struck down by the U.S. Court
of Appeals  for the Tenth  Circuit  in 1999,  and their  effectiveness  has been
stayed pending the court's review of a petition to the FCC for  reconsideration.
Even if the rules are  reinstated,  AT&T Wireless Group does not anticipate that
they will result in a  significant  adverse  impact on its  financial  position,
results of operation or liquidity.

         State commissions have become increasingly  aggressive in their efforts
to conserve numbering resources. Examples of state conservation methods include:
number  pooling,  number  rationing  and code  sharing.  A number of states have
petitioned the FCC for authority to adopt  "technology  specific"  overlays that
would require wireless  providers to obtain telephone  numbers out of a separate
area  code  and may  require  wireless  providers  to  change  their  customers'
telephone  numbers.  These  efforts may impact  wireless  service  providers  by
imposing additional costs or limiting access to numbering resources.

         The   FCC   has   adopted   detailed   billing   rules   for   landline
telecommunications  service  providers  and  applied a number of these  rules to
commercial  mobile radio  services  providers.  The FCC is  considering  whether
carriers  that  decide  to  pass  through  their  mandatory   universal  service
contributions   to  their  customers  should  be  required  to  provide  a  full
explanation  of the program,  and whether to ensure that the carriers  that pass
through their  contribution  do not recover amounts greater than their mandatory
contributions  from their  customers.  Adoption  of some of the FCC's  proposals
could increase the complexity of our billing  processes and restrict our ability
to bill customers for services in the most commercially advantageous way.

         The FCC has  adopted  an  order  that  determines  the  obligations  of
telecommunications  carriers to make their  services  accessible to  individuals
with disabilities.  The order requires  telecommunications services providers to
offer  equipment and services that are accessible to and useable by persons with
disabilities.  While the rules exempt  telecommunications  carriers from meeting
general  disability  access   requirements  if  such  results  are  not  readily
achievable,  it is not clear how liberally the FCC will construe this exemption.
Accordingly, the rules could require us to make material changes to our network,
product line, or services at our expense.

         In June 1999, the FCC initiated an administrative rulemaking proceeding
to help  facilitate  the offering of calling party pays as an optional  wireless
service.  Under the calling party pays service,  the party placing the call to a
wireless customer pays the wireless airtime charges.  Most wireless customers in
the United States now pay both to place calls and to receive them. Adoption of a
calling  party pays system on a widespread  basis could make  commercial  mobile
radio   service   providers   more   competitive   with   traditional   landline
telecommunications providers for the provision of regular telephone service.

         The FCC has adopted  rules  specifying  standards and the methods to be
used in evaluating  radiofrequency  emissions  from radio  equipment,  including
network  equipment and handsets used in connection with commercial  mobile radio
service.  These rules were upheld on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.  The U.S.  Supreme Court declined to review the Second Circuit's
ruling.  AT&T Wireless  Group's network  facilities and the handsets it sells to
customers comply with these standards.
<PAGE>

         Media reports have suggested that some radio  frequency  emissions from
wireless  handsets may be linked to health concerns,  including the incidence of
cancer.  Although some studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions may
cause certain  biological  effects,  all of the expert reviews conducted to date
have  concluded  that the evidence does not support a finding of adverse  health
effects  but that  further  research is  appropriate.  Earlier  this year,  CTIA
entered into a Cooperative  Research and  Development  Agreement to sponsor such
research.

         Studies have shown that some hand-held digital telephones may interfere
with some medical devices,  including  hearing aids and pacemakers.  The FDA has
recently issued guidelines for the use of wireless phones by pacemaker  wearers.
Additional  studies are  underway to evaluate and improve the  compatibility  of
hearing aids and digital wireless phones.

         State and local regulation

         State and local governments are preempted from regulating either market
entry by, or the rates of, wireless  operators.  However,  state governments can
regulate other terms and conditions of wireless  service and several states have
imposed,  or have  proposed  legislation  that  will  impose,  various  consumer
protection regulations on the wireless industry. As noted above, States also may
impose  their own  universal  service  support  regimes  on  wireless  and other
telecommunications   carriers,  similar  to  the  requirements  that  have  been
established by the FCC and have been delegated  certain  authority by the FCC in
the area of number allocation and administration.  At the local level,  wireless
facilities  typically  are subject to zoning and land use  regulation.  However,
under the federal  Telecommunications  Act, neither local nor state  governments
may  categorically  prohibit  the  construction  of wireless  facilities  in any
community or  unreasonably  discriminate  against a carrier.  Numerous State and
local  jurisdictions  have considered  imposing  conditions on a driver's use of
wireless  technology  while  operating a motor vehicle,  and a few have actually
done so.

Cable Regulation and Legislation

         The operation of cable television  systems is extensively  regulated by
the  FCC,   some   state   governments   and   most   local   governments.   The
Telecommunications  Act altered the regulatory  structure governing the nation's
telecommunications  providers.  It removes  barriers to  competition in both the
cable television market and the local telephone  market.  Among other things, it
reduces the scope of cable rate regulation.

         The  Telecommunications  Act  required  the FCC to  implement  numerous
rulemakings,  some of which are still  subject  to court  challenges.  Moreover,
Congress and the FCC have frequently  revisited the subject of cable  television
regulation and may do so again.  Future legislative and regulatory changes could
adversely affect AT&T Broadband's  operations.  This section briefly  summarizes
key laws and  regulations  currently  affecting the growth and operation of AT&T
Broadband's cable systems.

         Cable Rate Regulation

         The 1992 Cable Act imposed an extensive rate  regulation  regime on the
cable  television  industry,  which  limited the ability of cable  companies  to
increase subscriber fees. Under that regime, all cable systems were subjected to
rate  regulation,  unless  they  face  "effective  competition"  in their  local
franchise  area.   Federal  law  now  defines   "effective   competition"  on  a
community-specific  basis as requiring  satisfaction of conditions not typically
satisfied in the current marketplace.
<PAGE>

         Although the FCC  establishes  all cable rate rules,  local  government
units  (commonly  referred to as local  franchising  authorities  or "LFAs") are
primarily  responsible for  administering  the regulation of the lowest level of
cable - the basic service tier ("BST"), which typically contains local broadcast
stations and PEG access channels.  Before an LFA begins BST rate regulation,  it
must certify to the FCC that it will follow  applicable  federal rules, and many
LFAs have  voluntarily  declined  to  exercise  this  authority.  LFAs also have
primary  responsibility for regulating cable equipment rates. Under federal law,
charges for various types of cable  equipment  must be unbundled from each other
and from monthly charges for programming services, and priced no higher than the
operator's actual cost, plus an 11.25% rate of return.

         The  FCC  historically   administered  rate  regulation  of  any  cable
programming service tiers ("CPST"), which typically contain  satellite-delivered
programming.  Under the Telecommunications  Act, however, the FCC's authority to
regulate CPST rates sunset on March 31, 1999.

         Cable Entry Into Telecommunications

         The  Telecommunications  Act  provides  that no state or local  laws or
regulations  may  prohibit  or have the effect of  prohibiting  any entity  from
providing any interstate or intrastate  telecommunications  service.  States are
authorized,  however, to impose "competitively  neutral" requirements  regarding
universal  service,  public safety and welfare,  service  quality,  and consumer
protection.  State and local  governments  also retain their authority to manage
the public  rights-of way.  Although the  Telecommunications  Act clarifies that
traditional  cable  franchise fees may be based only on revenues  related to the
provision of cable television  services,  it also provides that LFAs may require
reasonable,  competitively  neutral  compensation  for  management of the public
rights-of-way  when cable  operators  provide  telecommunications  service." The
Telecommunications  Act prohibits LFAs from requiring cable operators to provide
telecommunications  service or facilities  as a condition of a franchise  grant,
renewal  or  transfer,  except  that  LFAs  argue  they can seek  "institutional
networks" as part of such franchise negotiations.  The favorable pole attachment
rates  afforded  cable  operators  under federal law can be increased by utility
companies  owning the poles during a five year phase-in period beginning in 2001
if the cable  operator  provides  telecommunications  service,  as well as cable
service,  over its plant. The FCC clarified that a cable operator's provision of
cable Internet  service does not affect the favorable  pole rates,  but a recent
decision by the Eleventh  Circuit Court of Appeals  disagreed and suggested that
Internet  traffic is neither  cable service nor  telecommunications  service and
might leave cable  attachments  that carry Internet  traffic  ineligible for the
federal rate  structure.  This decision could lead to  substantial  increases in
pole attachment rates, and certain utilities have already proposed vastly higher
pole attachment  rates based in part on the existing court decision.  The United
States  Supreme  Court is now  reviewing  this  decision.  The Eleventh  Circuit
mandate has been stayed  pending  Supreme Court  action,  and a variety of cable
operators,  including AT&T  Broadband,  are challenging  certain  increased pole
attachment rates at the FCC.

         Cable entry into  telecommunications will be affected by the regulatory
landscape  now being  fashioned  by the FCC and state  regulators.  One critical
component of the  Telecommunications Act intended to facilitate the entry of new
telecommunications  providers (including cable operators) is the interconnection
obligation  imposed  on all  telecommunications  carriers.  This  requires,  for
example,  that the incumbent  local  telephone  company must allow new competing
telecommunications  providers  to  connect to the local  telephone  distribution
system. A number of implementation details are subject to ongoing regulatory and
judicial review, but the basic requirement is now well established.
<PAGE>

         Cable Systems Providing Internet Service

         Although there is at present no significant federal regulation of cable
system delivery of Internet services, and the Federal Communications  Commission
recently  issued  several  reports  finding  no  immediate  need to impose  such
regulation,  this situation may change as cable systems  expand their  broadband
delivery of Internet  services.  In particular,  proposals have been advanced at
the Federal  Communications  Commission  and Congress  that would  require cable
operators to provide  access to  unaffiliated  Internet  service  providers  and
online  service  providers.  The Federal Trade  Commission  and the FCC recently
imposed  certain open access  requirements  on Time Warner and AOL in connection
with their  merger,  but those  requirements  are not  applicable to other cable
operators.  Some states and local  franchising  authorities  are considering the
imposition of mandatory Internet access  requirements as part of cable franchise
renewals or transfers. In June 2000, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
an attempt by the City of Portland,  Oregon to impose mandatory  Internet access
requirements  on the local  cable  operator.  AT&T  Broadband  has  commenced  a
technical and operational  trial to test how multiple Internet service providers
can offer  high-speed,  always-on  cable  Internet  service  over a hybrid fiber
coaxial network.

         Telephone Company Entry Into Cable Television

         The  Telecommunications  Act  allows  telephone  companies  to  compete
directly with cable operators by repealing the historic telephone  company/cable
company cross-ownership ban and the FCC's video dial tone regulations. This will
allow LECs, including the RBOCs, to compete with cable operators both inside and
outside their telephone service areas. Because of their resources, LECs could be
formidable  competitors to traditional  cable  operators,  and certain LECs have
begun offering cable service.

         Under the Telecommunications Act, a LEC or other entity providing video
programming  to  customers  will be regulated as a  traditional  cable  operator
(subject to local franchising and federal  regulatory  requirements),  unless it
elects to provide its  programming  via an "open video system"  ("OVS").  It was
anticipated  that the primary  benefit of using an OVS  regulatory  model was to
avoid the need to obtain a local franchise prior to providing services. However,
a January 1999 federal court of appeals  decision held that OVS providers can be
required to obtain such a franchise. To be eligible for OVS status, the provider
cannot occupy more than one-third of the system's activated channels when demand
for channels  exceeds  supply.  Nor can it  discriminate  among  programmers  or
establish unreasonable rates, terms or conditions for service.

         Although LECs and cable operators can now expand their offerings across
traditional service boundaries,  the general  prohibitions remain on LEC buyouts
(i.e., any ownership interest  exceeding10 percent) of co-located cable systems,
cable operator buyouts of co-located LEC systems, and joint ventures among cable
operators and LECs in the same market. The Telecommunications Act provides a few
limited exceptions to this buyout prohibition.

         Electric Utility Entry Into
Telecommunications/Cable Television

         The  Telecommunications  Act provides that  registered  utility holding
companies and subsidiaries may provide telecommunications services,  information
services, and other services or products subject to the jurisdiction of the FCCs
notwithstanding  the public Utilities  Holding Company Act.  Electric  utilities
must  establish  separate  subsidiaries,  known  as  "exempt  telecommunications
companies" and must apply to the FCC for operating authority.  Again, because of
their  resources,   electric  utilities  could  be  formidable   competitors  to
traditional cable systems.
<PAGE>

         Cable Television Ownership Restrictions

         Pursuant  to  the  1992  Cable  Act,   the  FCC   adopted   regulations
establishing  a 30%  limit  on the  number  of  multichannel  video  subscribers
(including cable and DBS subscribers) nationwide that a cable operator may reach
through  cable  systems  in which it holds  an  attributable  interest,  with an
increase to 35% if the additional cable systems are minority controlled. The FCC
stayed the effectiveness of its ownership limits pending judicial review.

         The  Federal  Communications  Commission  directly  addressed  the  30%
ownership rule (and the applicable ownership attribution  standards) in its June
2000  ruling on AT&T's  merger with  MediaOne.  The FCC allowed the merger to go
forward,  but required  AT&T to elect one of three  divestiture  options to come
into  compliance  with the 30% ownership cap.  Compliance (or  arrangements  for
compliance) is required by May, 2001.

         The FCC previously adopted  regulations  limiting carriage by the cable
operator  of  national  programming  services  in which that  operator  holds an
attributable  interest  to 40% of the  activated  channels  on each of the cable
operator's systems.  The rules provide for the use of two additional channels or
a 45% limit,  whichever is greater,  provided that the additional channels carry
minority  controlled  programming  services.  The regulations  also  grandfather
existing carriage  arrangements which exceed the channel limits, but require new
channel  capacity to be devoted to unaffiliated  programming  services until the
system achieves compliance with the regulations.  These channel occupancy limits
apply only up to75 activated  channels on the cable system, and the rules do not
apply to local or regional programming services.

         In March, 2001, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the rules
adopted by the FCC pertaining to ownership and programming carriage and remanded
the issues  back to the FCC for  further  review.  The impact of this  decision,
including its impact on the MediaOne Order, is not yet known.

         The   Telecommunications   Act  eliminates  statutory  restrictions  on
broadcast/cable     cross-ownership     (including    broadcast    network/cable
restrictions),  but leaves in place existing FCC regulations  prohibiting  local
cross-ownership   between   television   stations   and   cable   systems.   The
Telecommunications   Act  leaves  in  place  existing   restrictions   on  cable
cross-ownership  with SMATV and MMDS  facilities,  but lifts those  restrictions
where the cable operator is subject to effective  competition.  In January 1995,
however,  the FCC adopted  regulations  which permit cable  operators to own and
operate SMATV systems within their franchise area,  provided that such operation
is consistent with local cable franchise requirements.

         Must Carry/Retransmission Consent

         The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that
allow local commercial  television  broadcast stations to elect once every three
years between  requiring a cable system to carry the station  ("must  carry") or
negotiating for payments for granting  permission to the cable operator to carry
the station  ("retransmission  consent").  Less popular stations typically elect
must carry, and more popular stations  typically elect  retransmission  consent.
Must  carry  requests  can dilute  the  appeal of a cable  system's  programming
offerings,  and retransmission  consent demands may require substantial payments
or other  concessions  (e.g. a requirement  that the cable system also carry the
local broadcaster's  affiliated cable programming service).  Either option has a
potentially adverse effect on AT&T Broadband's  business.  The burden associated
with must-carry  obligations could dramatically increase if television broadcast

<PAGE>

stations proceed with planned  conversions to digital  transmissions  and if the
FCC  determines  that cable  systems  must carry  simultaneously  all analog and
digital  signals  transmitted by the television  stations  during the multi-year
transition in which a single broadcast license is authorized to transmit both an
analog and a digital signal.  The FCC tentatively  decided against imposition of
dual digital and analog must carry in a January  2001 ruling.  At the same time,
however,  it initiated further  fact-gathering  which ultimately could lead to a
reconsideration of that tentative conclusion.

         Access Channels

         LFAs can include franchise  provisions requiring cable operators to set
aside certain channels for non-commercial  public,  educational and governmental
("PEG") access programming.  Federal law also requires a cable system with 36 or
more  channels to designate a portion of its activated  channel  capacity (up to
15%) for commercial  leased access by  unaffiliated  third parties.  The FCC has
adopted  rules  regulating  the  terms,  conditions  and  maximum  rates a cable
operator  may charge for use of this  designated  channel  capacity,  but use of
commercial leased access channels has been relatively limited.

         "Anti-Buy Through" Provisions

         Federal law requires each cable system to permit  customers to purchase
premium  or  pay-per-view  video  programming  offered  by  the  operator  on  a
per-channel  or a per-program  basis without the necessity of subscribing to any
tier of service  (other than the basic service tier) unless the system's lack of
addressable  converter boxes or other technological  limitations does not permit
it to do so. The  statutory  exemption  for cable  systems  that do not have the
technological  capability  to comply  expires in October  2002,  but the FCC may
extend that period if deemed necessary.

         Access to Programming

         To  spur  the   development  of  independent   cable   programmers  and
competition  to  incumbent   cable   operators,   the  1992  Cable  Act  imposed
restrictions on the dealings between cable operators and cable  programmers.  Of
special  significance from a competitive  business  posture,  the 1992 Cable Act
precludes  satellite  video  programmers  affiliated  with cable  operators from
favoring  cable  operators  over  competing   multichannel   video   programming
distributors  (such as DBS and MMDS  distributors).  This  provision  limits the
ability of vertically  integrated satellite cable programmers to offer exclusive
programming  arrangements  to AT&T  Broadband.  Both  Congress  and the FCC have
considered  proposals  that would  expand the program  access  rights of cable's
competitors,   including  the  possibility  of  subjecting  both   terrestrially
delivered video  programming  and video  programmers who are not affiliated with
cable  operators to all program access  requirements.  Pursuant to the Satellite
Home  Viewer  Improvement  Act,  the  FCC  has  adopted  regulations   governing
retransmission  consent  negotiations  between broadcasters and all multichannel
video programming distributors, including cable and DBS.

         Inside Wiring; Subscriber Access

         Federal  Communications  Commission  rules  require an incumbent  cable
operator upon expiration of a multiple  dwelling unit service  contract to sell,
abandon, or remove "home run" wiring that was installed by the cable operator in
a multiple  dwelling  unit  building.  These inside wiring rules are expected to
assist  building  owners in their attempts to replace  existing cable  operators
with new  programming  providers  who are  willing to pay the  building  owner a

<PAGE>

higher  fee,  where  such  a fee  is  permissible.  The  Federal  Communications
Commission  has also proposed  abrogating all exclusive  multiple  dwelling unit
service agreements held by incumbent operators, but allowing such contracts when
held  by  new  entrants.  In  another  proceeding,  the  Federal  Communications
Commission has preempted  restrictions  on the deployment of private  antenna on
rental  property  within the  exclusive  use of a tenant,  such as balconies and
patios.  This Federal  Communications  Commission ruling may limit the extent to
which  multiple  dwelling  unit owners may enforce  certain  aspects of multiple
dwelling unit agreements  which otherwise  prohibit,  for example,  placement of
digital  broadcast  satellite  receiver antennae in multiple dwelling unit areas
under the exclusive  occupancy of a renter.  These developments may make it more
difficult  for AT&T  Broadband  to provide  service in  multiple  dwelling  unit
complexes.

         Other Regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission

         In addition to the Federal Communications  Commission regulations noted
above,  there are other  regulations  of the Federal  Communications  Commission
covering such areas as:

     o    equal  employment  opportunity  (currently  suspended as a result of a
          judicial  ruling),
     o    subscriber privacy,
     o    programming practices, including, among other things:

          (1)  syndicated program exclusivity,  which requires a cable system to
               delete  particular  programming  offered  by a distant  broadcast
               signal carried on the system which duplicates the programming for

         The  Federal  Communications   Commission  recently  ruled  that  cable
customers  must be allowed to purchase cable  converters  from third parties and
established a multi-year phase-in during which security  functions,  which would
remain in the  operator's  exclusive  control,  would be  unbundled  from  basic
converter  functions,  which could then be satisfied by third party vendors. The
first phase implementation date was July 1, 2000. Compliance was technically and
operationally  difficult in some locations,  so AT&T Broadband and several other
cable  operators  filed a request at the FCC that the  requirement  be waived in
those systems.  The request  resulted in a temporary  deferral of the compliance
deadline for those systems.
<PAGE>

         The FCC recently  initiated  an inquiry to determine  whether the cable
industry's  future  provision  of  interactive  services  should be  subject  to
regulations  ensuring equal access and competition  among service  vendors.  The
inquiry,  which  grew out of the  Commission's  review  of the  AOL-Time  Warner
merger, is in its earliest stages.

         The Federal Communications  Commission has the authority to enforce its
regulations  through the imposition of substantial  fines, the issuance of cease
and desist orders and/or the imposition of other administrative  sanctions, such
as the  revocation  of  Federal  Communications  Commission  licenses  needed to
operate   certain   transmission   facilities  used  in  connection  with  cable
operations.

         Copyright

         Cable  television  systems are subject to federal  copyright  licensing
covering  carriage of television and radio  broadcast  signals.  In exchange for
filing  certain  reports and  contributing  a percentage  of their  revenue to a
federal  copyright royalty pool (such percentage varies depending on the size of
the  system and the number of distant  broadcast  television  signals  carried),
cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material
on  broadcast  signals.  The  possible   modification  or  elimination  of  this
compulsory copyright license is subject to continuing review and could adversely
affect AT&T  Broadband's  ability to obtain desired  broadcast  programming.  In
addition,  the cable industry pays music licensing fees to Broadcast Music, Inc.
and the  American  Society  of  Composers,  Authors  and  Publishers.  Copyright
clearances for  nonbroadcast  programming  services are arranged through private
negotiations.

         State and Local Regulation

         Cable   television   systems   generally   are  operated   pursuant  to
nonexclusive  franchises  granted  by a  municipality  or  other  state or local
government  entity.  The  Telecommunications  Act clarified that the need for an
entity  providing cable services to obtain a local  franchise  depends solely on
whether the entity  crosses  public  rights of way.  Federal  law now  prohibits
franchise  authorities from granting  exclusive  franchises or from unreasonably
refusing to award  additional  franchises  covering an existing  cable  system's
service area. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many
cases are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.
Non-compliance  by the cable operator with franchise  provisions may also result
in monetary penalties.

         The  terms  and   conditions  of  franchises   vary   materially   from
jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  Each franchise  generally  contains  provisions
governing cable operations,  service rates,  franchise fees, system construction
and  maintenance  obligations,  system  channel  capacity,  design and technical
performance,  customer service standards,  and  indemnification  protections.  A
number of  states  subject  cable  television  systems  to the  jurisdiction  of
centralized  state  governmental  agencies.   Although  LFAs  have  considerable
discretion  in  establishing   franchise   terms,   there  are  certain  federal
limitations.  For example,  LFAs cannot insist on franchise fees exceeding 5% of
the system's gross revenue, cannot dictate the particular technology used by the
system,  and cannot  specify  video  programming  other than  identifying  broad
categories of programming.

         Federal law contains renewal  procedures  designed to protect incumbent
franchisees  against  arbitrary  denials  of  renewal.  Even if a  franchise  is

<PAGE>

renewed,  the  franchise  authority  may seek to  impose  new and  more  onerous
requirements  such  as  significant  upgrades  in  facilities  and  services  or
increased franchise fees and funding for PEG channels as a condition of renewal.
Similarly,  if a franchise  authority's  consent is required for the purchase or
sale of a cable system or franchise,  such  authority may attempt to impose more
burdensome or onerous  franchise  requirements  in connection with a request for
consent.  Historically,  franchises  have been renewed for cable  operators that
have  provided  satisfactory  services and have complied with the terms of their
franchises.

         Proposed Changes in Regulation

         The regulation of cable  television  systems at the federal,  state and
local levels is subject to the  political  process and has been in constant flux
over the past decade.  Material  changes in the law and regulatory  requirements
must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that AT&T Broadband's business
will  not be  affected  adversely  by  future  legislation,  new  regulation  or
deregulation.

COMPETITION

         Competition in long distance and local  telecommunications  services is
based on price and  pricing  plans,  the  types of  services  offered,  customer
service,  access to customer premises, and communications  quality,  reliability
and  availability,  as well as, for business  customers,  the ability to provide
high quality data communication services and technical support. AT&T's principal
competitors include  MCIWorldcom,  Inc., Sprint  Corporation,  the RBOCs and GTE
Corporation. AT&T also experiences significant competition in long distance from
a number  of newer  entrants,  such as  Qwest,  and a large  number  of  smaller
entities,   including  dial  around  resellers.   In  addition,   long  distance
telecommunications  providers have been facing competition from  non-traditional
sources, including as a result of technological substitutions,  such as Internet
telephony, e-mail, and wireless services.

                  The ILECs have very  substantial  capital and other resources,
long standing  customer  relationships  and extensive  existing  facilities  and
network  rights-of-way and are AT&T's primary  competitors in the local services
market.  Additionally,  a number of long distance  telecommunication,  wireless,
cable and other  service  providers  have entered the local  services  market in
competition  with AT&T.  Some of these  actual and  potential  competitors  have
substantial  financial  and other  resources.  AT&T also  competes  in the local
services  market  with a number of CLECs,  a few of which  have  existing  local
networks and significant financial resources.

         Competition for subscribers  among wireless service  providers is based
principally  upon the services  and features  offered,  call  quality,  customer
service,  system  coverage and price.  AT&T Wireless  Group's ability to compete
successfully  will depend,  in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to
various competitive factors affecting the industry,  including new services that
may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic
conditions  and  pricing  strategies.   Increased  competitive  pressures,   the
introduction or popularity of new products and services, including prepaid phone
products, as well as a general softening of the economy,  could adversely affect
our results,  increase our churn and decrease our average revenue per user. AT&T
Wireless Group's primary national  competitors are Cingular,  Verizon  Wireless,
Nextel Communications, Inc., VoiceStream Communications and Sprint PCS.
<PAGE>

         In addition, the wireless communications industry has been experiencing
significant  consolidation  and  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group  expects  that  this
consolidation will continue.  The previously  announced,  or recently completed,
mergers or joint  ventures of Bell  Atlantic/GTE/Vodafone  AirTouch  (now called
Verizon),  SBC/Bell  South/Ameritech  (now called  Cingular) have created large,
well-capitalized  competitors with substantial financial,  technical,  marketing
and other resources to respond to AT&T Wireless Group's offerings.  In addition,
in July 2000,  VoiceStream  Communications  and  Deutsche  Telekom  announced  a
proposed  transaction.  These  mergers or ventures  have  caused  AT&T  Wireless
Group's ranking to decline to third in U.S. revenue and U.S.  subscriber  share.
In terms of U.S.  population covered by licenses,  or POPs, AT&T Wireless Group,
including  partnerships  and  affiliates,   ranks  third.  As  a  result,  these
competitors may be able to offer nationwide  services and plans more quickly and
more  economically than the AT&T Wireless Group and to obtain roaming rates that
are more favorable than those obtained by AT&T Wireless Group, and may be better
able to respond to offers of AT&T Wireless Group.

         AT&T  Wireless  Group's  cellular  operations  have always  experienced
direct  competition from the second cellular licensee in each market.  Beginning
in 1997, AT&T Wireless Group began experiencing  competition from as many as six
license  holders in certain  markets.  Competition  from new  providers  in AT&T
Wireless  Group's  markets will  continue to increase as the networks of license
holders  are built out over the next  several  years.  In  addition,  the FCC is
likely to offer  additional  spectrum for wireless mobile licenses in the future
using existing or new technologies.

                  Cable television  competes for customers in local markets with
other providers of entertainment, news and information. The competitors in these
markets include broadcast television and radio, newspapers,  magazines and other
printed material,  motion picture theatres, video cassettes and other sources of
information and entertainment  including  directly  competitive cable television
operations  and  internet  service  providers.  The Cable Acts are  designed  to
increase  competition in the cable  television  industry.  There are alternative
methods of distributing the same or similar video  programming  offered by cable
television  systems.  These include direct  broadcast  satellite,  known as DBS,
(allowing the subscriber to receive video services  directly via satellite using
a relatively  small dish),  telephone  networks  (whether it is through wireless
cable, or through upgraded telephone networks),  utility company networks,  MMDS
(which  deliver  programming   services  over  microwave  channels  received  by
customers with special antennas),  competitive,  non-exclusive franchises,  city
provided  cable  services,  SMATV systems (which  provide  multichannel  program
services directly to hotel, motel, apartment, condominium and similar multi-unit
complexes within a cable television  system's franchise area,  generally free of
any  regulation  by state and local  governmental  authorities).  In addition to
competition for customers, the cable television industry competes with broadcast
television,  radio,  the print  media  and  other  sources  of  information  and
entertainment for advertising revenue. Additionally, as AT&T Broadband begins to
offer new services such as high speed  Internet  access and telephone  services,
there will be significant  competition  from both the local telephone  companies
and new providers of such services.

         DBS has emerged as significant  competition  to cable systems.  The DBS
industry has grown rapidly over the last several years, far exceeding the growth
rate of the cable television  industry,  and now serves approximately 14 million
subscribers   nationwide  DBS  companies   historically   were  prohibited  from
retransmitting popular local broadcast programming, but a change to the existing
copyright laws in November 1999 eliminated this legal impediment.  DBS companies
now need to secure  retransmission  consent from the popular broadcast  stations

<PAGE>

they wish to carry,  and they will face mandatory  carriage  obligations of less
popular  broadcast  stations as of January 2002. In response to the legislation,
DirecTV,  Inc.  and  EchoStar  Communications  Corporation  already  have  begun
carrying the major network stations in the nation's top television markets. DBS,
however,  is  limited in the local  programming  it can  provide  because of the
current capacity limitations of satellite technology. It is, therefore, expected
that DBS companies  will offer local  broadcast  programming  only in the larger
U.S. markets for the foreseeable  future.  The DBS industry recently initiated a
judicial  challenge  to the  statutory  requirement  mandating  carriage of less
popular broadcast stations. This lawsuit alleges that the must carry requirement
(similar to the one already  applicable to cable  systems) is  unconstitutional.
EchoStar began providing  high-speed  Internet access in late 2000, and DirecTV,
who has partnered with AOL, reports that it will begin providing its own version
of  high-speed   Internet  access  shortly.   These  developments  will  provide
significant new competition to AT&T Broadband's  offering of high speed Internet
access.

         AT&T currently faces significant competition and expects that the level
of  competition  will  continue to  increase.  As  competitive,  regulatory  and
technological    changes   occur,    including    those    occasioned   by   the
Telecommunications Act, AT&T anticipates that new and different competitors will
enter and expand their positions in the communications  services markets.  These
may include entrants from other segments of the  communications  and information
services  industry  or  global  competitors   seeking  to  expand  their  market
opportunities.  Many such new  competitors  are  likely  to enter  with a strong
market  presence,   well  recognized  names  and  pre-existing  direct  customer
relationships.  The  Telecommunications Act has already had a significant impact
on the competitive environment.  Anticipating changes in the industry,  non-RBOC
LECs,  which  are  not  required  to  implement  the  Telecommunications   Act's
competitive  checklist  prior to offering  long  distance in their home markets,
have integrated  their local service  offerings with long distance  offerings in
advance  of AT&T  offering  combined  local and long  distance  service in these
areas,  and continue to adversely  affect AT&T's  revenues and earnings in these
service regions.

         In  addition,  the  Telecommunications  Act  permits  RBOCs to  provide
interLATA  interexchange  services  after  demonstrating  to the FCC  that  such
provision is in the public  interest,  and that it has satisfied the  conditions
for developing local competition  established by the Telecommunications Act. The
RBOCs have petitioned the FCC for permission to provide interLATA  interexchange
services in one or more states  within  their home  market;  to date the FCC has
granted four of these petitions. In December 1999, Verizon became the first RBOC
to  obtain  approval  to  provide  long  distance  in a state  within  its  home
territory,  in New York.  The FCC authorized  SBC  Communications,  Inc.'s Texas
application in April 2000. More recently, in February 2001, the FCC approved SBC
applications in Kansas and Oklahoma.

         To the  extent  that the RBOCs  obtain  in-region  interLATA  authority
before the  Telecommunications  Act's checklist of conditions have been fully or
satisfactorily   implemented  and  adequate   facilities-based   local  exchange
competition   exists,   there  is  a  substantial   risk  that  AT&T  and  other
interexchange  service  providers  would be at a  disadvantage  to the  RBOCs in
providing both local service and combined service packages. Because it is widely
anticipated  that  substantial  numbers of long distance  customers will seek to
purchase local,  interexchange  and other services from a single carrier as part
of a combined or full service package, any competitive  disadvantage,  inability
to  profitably   provide  local  service  at  competitive  rates  or  delays  or
limitations  in  providing  local  service or combined  service  packages  could

<PAGE>

adversely  affect  AT&T's  future  revenue  and  earnings.  In  any  event,  the
simultaneous entrance of numerous new competitors for interexchange and combined
service  packages is likely to  adversely  affect  AT&T's  future long  distance
revenue  and  could  adversely   affect  future  earnings.   In  addition,   the
substitution  of data and  Internet  services  for voice  services  is likely to
depress earnings because of the smaller margin these services contain.

         Furthermore, in February 1997, a General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS) was reached under the World Trade  Organization.  The GATS,  which became
effective  January  1,  1998,  is  designed  to  open  each  country's  domestic
telecommunications  markets to foreign  competitors.  The GATS, and future trade
agreements,  may  accelerate  the  entrance  into the  U.S.  market  of  foreign
telecommunications  providers,  certain of whom are  likely to possess  dominant
home market positions in which there is not effective competition.  The GATS may
also  permit  AT&T's  entrance  into  other  markets  as only a small  number of
countries refused to eliminate their foreign ownership restrictions.

         In addition to the matters  referred to above,  various other  factors,
including technological hurdles,  market acceptance,  start-up and ongoing costs
associated  with  the  provision  of  new  services  and  local  conditions  and
obstacles, could adversely affect the timing and success of AT&T's entrance into
the local exchange  services market and AT&T's ability to offer combined service
packages that include local service.

EMPLOYEES

         At December 31, 2000 AT&T employed approximately 166,000 persons in its
operations, approximately 97% of whom are located domestically. About 22% of the
domestically  located  employees of AT&T are represented by unions.  Of those so
represented,  about 94% are represented by the Communications Workers of America
(CWA),  which is  affiliated  with the  AFL-CIO;  about 5% by the  International
Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers  (IBEW),  which is also  affiliated  with the
AFL-CIO.  In addition,  there is a very small  remainder  of domestic  employees
represented by other unions.  Labor  agreements with most of these unions extend
through May 2002.

         Of AT&T's employees,  approximately 29,000 persons were employed by the
AT&T Wireless Group in its operations,  virtually all of whom are located in the
United States.

LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP

         The economic  performance  of the Liberty  Media Group are reflected in
the Liberty Media Group tracking stock. A description of the Liberty Media Group
is included as Exhibit (99)b to this Form 10-K.

<PAGE>

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

         Investors should  carefully  consider the following  factors  regarding
their investment in AT&T Corp. securities,  including AT&T Common Stock and AT&T
Wireless Group Tracking Stock.

SPECIAL  CONSIDERATIONS  RELATING TO THE FACT THAT AT&T WIRELESS  GROUP TRACKING
STOCK IS A TRACKING STOCK

The market price of AT&T Common Stock,  AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock and
Liberty Media Group tracking stock may not reflect the financial performance and
economic  value of each  groups as we intend and may not  effectively  track the
separate performance of each group

         The market price of AT&T Common  Stock,  AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking
stock and Liberty  Media  Tracking  Stock may not in fact reflect the  financial
performance  and  economic  value of each  group as we  intend.  Holders of AT&T
Common  Stock,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock and  Liberty  Media Group
tracking  stock will continue to be common  shareholders  of AT&T Corp.  and, as
such,  will be subject to all risks  associated with an investment in AT&T Corp.
and all of its businesses, assets and liabilities. The performance of AT&T Corp.
as a whole may affect the market  price of each stock or the market  price could
more  independently  reflect  the  performance  of the  business  of each group.
Investors  may discount the value of each stock  because each group is part of a
common  enterprise  with the rest of the operations of AT&T Corp.  rather than a
stand-alone entity.

Holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock and Liberty
Media Group  tracking  stock are  shareholders  of one company  and,  therefore,
financial impacts on one group could affect the other groups

         Holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock and
Liberty Media Group  tracking stock are all common  shareholders  of AT&T Corp.,
and are subject to risks  associated  with an investment in a single company and
all of AT&T  Corp.'s  businesses,  assets  and  liabilities.  Financial  effects
arising  from one  group  that  affect  AT&T  Corp.'s  consolidated  results  of
operations or financial  condition  could, if  significant,  affect the combined
results of  operations  or financial  position of the other groups or the market
price of the class of common shares  relating to the other groups.  In addition,
if AT&T Corp. or any of its subsidiaries were to incur significant  indebtedness
on behalf of a group,  including  indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection
with an  acquisition  or  investment,  it could affect the credit rating of AT&T
Corp. and its subsidiaries. This, in turn, could increase the borrowing costs of
the  other  groups  and AT&T  Corp.  as a whole.  Net  losses  of any  group and
dividends or  distributions  on shares of any class of common or preferred stock
will  reduce the funds of AT&T Corp.  legally  available  for  payment of future
dividends on each of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock and
Liberty Media Group tracking  stock.  For these reasons,  you should read AT&T's
consolidated  financial  information together with the financial  information of
AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group.

 The  complex  nature of the terms of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock and
Liberty Media Group tracking stock, or confusion in the marketplace about what a
tracking  stock is, could  adversely  affect the market  prices of AT&T Wireless
Group tracking stock or Liberty Media Group tracking stock

         Tracking  stocks,  like AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock and Liberty
Media Group tracking stock, are more complex than  traditional  common stock and

<PAGE>

are not directly comparable to common stock of companies that have been spun off
by their  parent  companies.  The  complex  nature of the terms of the  tracking
stock, and the potential  difficulties investors may have in understanding these
terms, may adversely affect the market price of such tracking stock. Examples of
these terms include:

     o    discretion  of  AT&T's  board  of  directors  to  make  determinations
          affecting AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,

     o    redemption  and  conversion  rights  in the  event  AT&T  disposes  of
          substantially all the assets attributed to AT&T Wireless Group,

     o    ability  of AT&T to convert  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking
          stock into shares of AT&T common stock, or

     o    voting rights of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,  Liberty Media
          Group tracking stock and AT&T common stock.

     Confusion in the marketplace  about what a tracking stock is and what it is
intended  to  represent  could also  adversely  affect the market  price of AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock and Liberty Media Group tracking stock.

Holders  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  will have  limited  separate
shareholder rights, and will have no additional rights specific to AT&T Wireless
Group, including direct voting rights

         Holders of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock do not have any direct
voting rights in AT&T Wireless Group, except to the extent required under AT&T's
charter or by New York law. Separate meetings for holders of AT&T Wireless Group
tracking stock are not held.  When a vote is taken on any matter as to which all
of our common  shares are voting  together as one class,  any class or series of
our common shares that is entitled to more than the number of votes  required to
approve  the matter  being voted upon is in a position to control the outcome of
the vote on that matter.

     Currently:
     o    each share of AT&T common stock has one vote,
     o    each share of Class B Liberty Media Group  tracking stock has 0.375 of
          a vote,
     o    each share of Class A Liberty Media Group tracking stock has 0.0375 of
          a vote and
     o    each share of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock has 0.5 of a vote.

         The  voting  power of each class is  subject  to  adjustment  for stock
splits,  stock dividends and  combinations,  including any  distribution of AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock to holders of AT&T common stock.

There is no board of  directors or  committee  that owes any separate  fiduciary
duties to holders of tracking stock,  apart from those owed to AT&T shareholders
generally

         AT&T does not have a separate  board of directors  to represent  solely
the interests of the holders of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock or Liberty
Media Group tracking  stock.  Each of AT&T Corp.'s board of directors,  the AT&T
Wireless Group capital stock committee and the Liberty Media Group capital stock
committee owes fiduciary  duties to AT&T Corp. and its  shareholders as a whole.
Consequently, there is no separate board of directors or committee that owes any
separate duties to the holders of tracking stock.
<PAGE>

Until the split-off, AT&T Wireless Group will be controlled by AT&T

         Subject to fiduciary  duties,  our policy  statements and inter-company
agreements,  our  board  of  directors  could  make  operational  and  financial
decisions or implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses of
a group. These decisions could include:

     o    allocation of financing opportunities in the public markets,
     o    allocation of business opportunities, resources and personnel, and
     o    transfers  of  services,  including  sales  agency,  resale  and other
          arrangements,  funds or assets  between  groups and other  inter-group
          transactions

that,  in each  case,  may be  suitable  for one or more  groups.  Any of  these
decisions may benefit one group more than the other groups.

         In addition, AT&T Wireless Group is, and may continue to be, subject to
AT&T Corp.'s existing  agreements or arrangements with third parties and consent
decrees, as well as new agreements or decrees.  These agreements or arrangements
or  decrees  currently  may  benefit  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  as in the  case of
purchasing  arrangements,  or may have the effect of limiting or  impairing  its
business  opportunities.  For example, AT&T and British  Telecommunications  plc
have  entered  into a joint  venture  agreement  for  the  provision  of  global
communications  services.  As part of that joint venture agreement,  among other
things,  AT&T  has  agreed  to  various   restrictions  on  its  businesses  and
activities,   including  non-competition  provisions  and  exclusive  purchasing
requirements, all of which apply to AT&T Wireless Group.

Holders of tracking stock may have potentially  diverging interests from holders
of other classes of AT&T Corp. capital stock

         The  existence of separate  classes of our common stock could give rise
to  occasions  when the  interests  of the  holders of AT&T common  stock,  AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock and/or Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge,
conflict or appear to diverge or conflict.  Examples include  determinations  by
AT&T Corp.'s board of directors to:

     o    set priorities for use of capital and debt capacity,
     o    pay or omit the  payment  of  dividends  on AT&T  common  stock,  AT&T
          Wireless Group  tracking stock or Liberty Media Group tracking  stock,
          except where such dividends are required,
     o    redeem shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock for shares of AT&T
          common stock or stock of qualifying subsidiaries of AT&T Corp.,
     o    approve dispositions of assets attributed to any group,
     o    allocate the proceeds of issuances  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking
          stock either to AT&T Common Stock Group with a corresponding reduction
          in the AT&T Common Stock Group's retained  portion,  if any, or to the
          equity of AT&T Wireless Group,
     o    formulate public policy positions for AT&T,
     o    establish material commercial relationships between groups, and
     o    make  operational  and financial  decisions  with respect to one group
          that could be considered to be detrimental to another group.

         In addition,  decisions  regarding  distribution  and other  commercial
arrangements  between  the groups may affect  costs,  service  alternatives  and
marketing  approaches  for each  group.  When  making  decisions  with regard to
matters that create potential diverging  interests,  our board of directors will
act in accordance with:
<PAGE>

     o    the terms of AT&T  Corp.'s  charter,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group policy
          statement,   the  Liberty   Media  Group  policy   statement  and  the
          inter-group  agreement  between AT&T and Liberty  Media  Group,  which
          governs the  relationship  between AT&T Common Stock Group and Liberty
          Media Group, to the extent applicable, and

     o    its fiduciary duties, which require our board of directors to consider
          the impact of these decisions on all shareholders of AT&T Corp.

     Our board of directors also could,  from time to time, refer to the Liberty
Media Group  capital stock  committee and the AT&T Wireless  Group capital stock
committee  matters  involving any conflict,  and have those committees report to
our board of  directors on those  matters or decide those  matters to the extent
permitted by AT&T's by-laws and applicable law.

AT&T's board of  directors  may redeem  tracking  stock in exchange for stock of
another subsidiary

         AT&T Corp.'s charter provides that AT&T Corp. may, at any time,  redeem
all  outstanding  shares of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock or Liberty Media
Group tracking stock in exchange for a specified number of outstanding shares of
common stock of a subsidiary of AT&T Corp. that satisfies  certain  requirements
under the Internal Revenue Code and that holds,  directly or indirectly,  all of
the assets and  liabilities  of such group.  This type of redemption may only be
made on a pro rata basis, and must be tax free to the holders of tracking stock,
except  with  respect to any cash that  holders  receive  in lieu of  fractional
shares.

         If we  complete  the  proposed  split-off  of AT&T  Wireless  Group and
Liberty Media Group in the manner we  contemplate,  our Board of Directors  will
use this redemption right to exchange all shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking
stock for shares of AT&T Wireless Services and all shares of Liberty Media Group
tracking  stock  for  shares  of  Liberty  Media  Corporation.   In  this  case,
shareholders  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock and Liberty  Media Group
tracking stock would no longer be shareholders of AT&T but would be shareholders
of a AT&T Wireless Services or Liberty Media Corporation, respectively.

 A decision by AT&T Corp.'s  board of directors to dispose of assets  attributed
to AT&T Wireless Group could have an adverse impact on the trading price of AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock

         Assuming AT&T Wireless Group's assets represent less than substantially
all of the  properties  and  assets  of AT&T  Corp.  as a  whole,  our  board of
directors  could,  in its sole  discretion  and  without  shareholder  approval,
approve sales and other  dispositions of any amount of the properties and assets
of AT&T Wireless Group because the New York Business  Corporation Law, or NYBCL,
requires  shareholder  approval only for a sale or other  disposition  of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of all of AT&T Corp.

         However,  in the event of a disposition of all or substantially  all of
the properties and assets  attributed to AT&T Wireless Group,  generally defined
as 80% or more of the fair value of that group,  AT&T will be required under its
charter to:

     o    convert each  outstanding  share of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
          into shares of AT&T common stock at a 10% premium, or
<PAGE>

     o    distribute  cash and/or  securities,  other than AT&T common stock, or
          other  property  equal to the fair value of the net proceeds from that
          disposition allocable to AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock, either by
          special  dividend or by redemption  of all or part of the  outstanding
          shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock, or

     o    take a combination  of the actions  described in the preceding  bullet
          points  whereby AT&T Corp.  would convert some shares of AT&T Wireless
          Group tracking stock into AT&T common stock at a 10% premium and pay a
          dividend on the remaining shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
          or redeem all or part of the remaining  shares of AT&T Wireless  Group
          tracking  stock for cash and/or  property equal to the fair value of a
          portion  of the net  proceeds  of the  disposition  allocable  to AT&T
          Wireless Group tracking stock.

         Our board of  directors is not required to select the option that would
result  in the  distribution  with  the  highest  value to the  holders  of AT&T
Wireless Group  tracking  stock.  In addition,  under New York law, our board of
directors  could  decline to dispose of AT&T  Wireless  Group  assets  even if a
majority of the holders of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock request such a
disposition.

AT&T Corp.  may take  positions  on public  policy or  regulatory  matters  that
benefit one group more than another

         Because of the nature of the businesses of AT&T Common Stock Group, and
AT&T Wireless Group, the groups may have diverging  interests as to the position
AT&T Corp. should take with respect to various  regulatory  issues. For example,
FCC regulations  that may advance the interests of one group may not advance the
interests of the other groups.  Under the AT&T Wireless Group policy  statement,
we will resolve material matters involving  potentially divergent interests in a
manner that our board of  directors,  or the AT&T  Wireless  Group capital stock
committee,  determines to be in the best  interests of AT&T Corp. and all of our
common shareholders after giving fair consideration to the potentially divergent
interests  and all other  relevant  interests  of the  holders  of the  separate
classes of our common shares.  Nevertheless,  our board of directors  could take
positions on any given issue that may benefit one group more than another.

The fiduciary  duties of our board of directors to more than one class of common
stock are not clear under New York law

         Although  we are not  aware of any legal  precedent  under New York law
involving the fiduciary  duties of directors of corporations  having two or more
classes  of common  stock,  or  separate  classes  or series of  capital  stock,
principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of
two  classes  of  capital  stock or two  groups of  holders of the same class of
capital  stock  provide  that a board of  directors  owes an  equal  duty to all
shareholders  regardless  of class or  series,  and  does not have  separate  or
additional  duties to either group of  shareholders.  Under these  principles of
Delaware law and the related  principle  known as the "business  judgment rule,"
absent  abuse  of  discretion,   a  good  faith  business  decision  made  by  a
disinterested and adequately informed board of directors,  or a committee of the
board of  directors,  with respect to any matter having  disparate  impacts upon
holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock or Liberty
Media  Group   tracking  stock  would  be  a  defense  to  any  challenge  to  a
determination  made by or on behalf of the  holders  of any class of our  common
shares.  Nevertheless,  a New York court hearing a case involving this type of a
challenge  may decide to apply  principles  of New York law  different  from the

<PAGE>

principles of Delaware law  discussed  above,  or may develop new  principles of
law, in order to decide that case. Any future  shareholder  litigation  over the
meaning  or  application  of the  terms of the  tracking  stock  or our  board's
policies  may be costly and time  consuming  to AT&T,  AT&T  Wireless  Group and
Liberty Media Group.

Our board of  directors  has the  ability  to control  inter-group  transactions
between AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless Group

         Our board of  directors  may decide to transfer  funds or other  assets
between  groups.  Transfers  of assets  from  AT&T  Common  Stock  Group to AT&T
Wireless Group that our board of directors  designates as an equity contribution
by AT&T Common Stock Group to AT&T Wireless  Group will result in an increase in
AT&T Common Stock Group's retained portion of the value of AT&T Wireless Group.

         Under the AT&T Wireless Group policy statement, AT&T Common Stock Group
may make  loans  to AT&T  Wireless  Group at  interest  rates  and on terms  and
conditions  substantially  equivalent  to  the  interest  rates  and  terms  and
conditions  that AT&T Wireless Group would be able to obtain from third parties,
including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate of AT&T without the benefit of
any guaranty by AT&T or any member of AT&T Common Stock Group. The AT&T Wireless
Group policy  statement  contemplates  that these terms will apply regardless of
the  interest  rates and terms and  conditions  on which AT&T or members of AT&T
Common  Stock Group may have  acquired the subject  funds.  We  anticipate  that
interest  rates payable by AT&T  Wireless  Group  initially  will be higher than
those payable by AT&T or the AT&T Common Stock Group.

         Any  increase in AT&T Common  Stock  Group's  retained  portion of AT&T
Wireless Group  resulting from an equity  contribution,  or any decrease in that
retained portion  resulting from a transfer of funds from AT&T Wireless Group to
AT&T Common Stock Group,  would be determined  by reference to the  then-current
market  value  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock.  Such an  increase  or
decrease, however, could occur at a time when those shares are considered under-
or  over-valued  and such a decrease could occur at a time when those shares are
considered under- or over-valued.

Our board of directors  may change the AT&T Wireless  Group Policy  Statement or
our By-Laws without shareholder approval

         The AT&T  Wireless  Group  policy  statement  governs the  relationship
between AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless Group and AT&T Corp.'s by-laws
create a capital stock committee that oversees the  interaction  between the two
groups.  Our board of directors may modify,  suspend or rescind the policies set
forth in the policy  statement or make  additions or  exceptions to them, in the
sole discretion of our board of directors, without approval of our shareholders,
although there is no present intention to do so. Our board of directors may also
adopt  additional  policies,  depending  upon the  circumstances.  AT&T  Corp.'s
by-laws  may  similarly  be  modified,  suspended  or  rescinded.  Our  board of
directors  would  make any  determination  to modify,  suspend or rescind  these
policies  or our  by-laws,  or to make  exceptions  to them or adopt  additional
policies or by-laws,  including any decision that would have  disparate  impacts
upon holders of AT&T common stock and AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  in a
manner  consistent with its fiduciary duties to AT&T Corp. and all of our common
shareholders  after  giving  fair  consideration  to the  potentially  divergent
interests  and all other  relevant  interests  of the  holders  of the  separate
classes of our common shares,  including the holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock and Liberty Media Group tracking stock.
<PAGE>

It will be difficult  for a third party to acquire AT&T  Wireless  Group without
AT&T Corp.'s consent

         If  AT&T  Wireless  Group  were  an  independent   entity,  any  person
interested in acquiring it without  negotiation  with our management  could seek
control of the  outstanding  stock of that entity by means of a tender  offer or
proxy  contest.  Although AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock is a class of our
common shares that is intended to reflect the financial performance and economic
value of AT&T  Wireless  Group,  a person  interested  in  acquiring  only  AT&T
Wireless Group without  negotiation  with our management still would be required
to seek  control  of the  voting  power  represented  by all of the  outstanding
capital stock of AT&T Corp. entitled to vote on that acquisition,  including the
classes of common  shares  related to the other  groups.  As a result,  this may
discourage  potential  interested  bidders from seeking to acquire AT&T Wireless
Group.

Future sales of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock and AT&T common stock could
adversely affect their respective market prices and the ability to raise capital
in the future

         Sales of substantial  amounts of AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,
including  any sale by AT&T of AT&T Wireless  Services  shares it retains in the
split-off,  and AT&T  common  stock in the public  market  could hurt the market
price of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. This also could hurt AT&T's ability
to raise capital in the future. The shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
that we sold to the  public in April  2000 and the shares  AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking stock to be issued in the exchange offer AT&T expects to conduct in the
second quarter 2001 are or will be freely tradable without restriction under the
Securities  Act of 1933 by persons other than  "affiliates"  of AT&T, as defined
under the  Securities  Act. Any sales of  substantial  amounts of AT&T  Wireless
Group  tracking  stock  or  AT&T  common  stock  in the  public  market,  or the
perception that those sales might occur,  could materially  adversely affect the
market price of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.

         The approval of the  shareholders  of AT&T and AT&T Wireless Group will
not be solicited  for the  issuance of  authorized  but unissued  shares of AT&T
Wireless Group  tracking  stock unless this approval is deemed  advisable by our
board of  directors  or is  required  by  applicable  law,  regulation  or stock
exchange  listing  requirements.  The  issuance of those shares could dilute the
value of shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.

We do not expect to pay dividends on AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock or AT&T
Wireless Services common stock

         Determinations  as to the  future  dividends  on  AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking stock primarily will be based upon the financial condition,  results of
operations and business  requirements of AT&T Wireless Group and AT&T Corp. as a
whole.  We currently do not expect to pay any dividends on AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking  stock  for the  foreseeable  future,  nor do we expect  AT&T  Wireless
Services to pay any  dividends on AT&T  Wireless  Services  common stock for the
foreseeable future following the split-off.

Changes in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result in
redemption of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock or may prevent us from issuing
further shares

         From time to time,  there  have  been  legislative  and  administrative
proposals that, if effective, would have resulted in the imposition of corporate
level or shareholder  level tax upon the issuance of tracking  stock.  As of the
date of this document, no such proposals are outstanding.
<PAGE>

         If there are adverse tax  consequences  associated with the issuance of
AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  it is possible that we would cease issuing
additional  shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.  This could affect the
value of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock then outstanding.

         Furthermore,  we are entitled to convert AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking
stock into AT&T common  stock at a premium of 10% if,  based upon the opinion of
tax counsel,  adverse U.S. federal income tax law  developments  related to AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock occur.

In some instances,  we may optionally redeem AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,
including as a result of an adverse tax law change

         Our board of directors  may, at any time after either the occurrence of
tax-related events, such as the ones described above, or May 2, 2002, redeem all
outstanding  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock for shares of AT&T
common stock at a 10% premium. We could decide to redeem shares of AT&T Wireless
Group tracking stock at a time when either or both of AT&T common stock and AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued.
In addition, a redemption at any premium would preclude holders of AT&T Wireless
Group tracking stock from retaining their  investment in a security  intended to
reflect  separately the economic  performance of AT&T Wireless  Group.  It would
also give holders of shares of converted  AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock an
amount of  consideration  that may  differ  from the amount of  consideration  a
third-party  buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially  all of the assets
of the AT&T Wireless Group.

<PAGE>

If we liquidate  AT&T,  amounts  distributed  to holders of each class of common
stock may not bear any relationship to the value of the assets attributed to the
groups

         Under our charter,  we would  determine the  liquidation  rights of the
holders of the  respective  classes  of stock in  accordance  with each  group's
respective  market  capitalization  at the  time of  liquidation.  However,  the
relative market capitalization of each group may not correctly reflect the value
of the net assets  remaining and attributed to the groups after  satisfaction of
outstanding liabilities.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS OF AT&T WIRELESS GROUP

 AT&T Wireless  Group may  substantially  increase its debt level in the future,
which could subject it to various  restrictions  and higher  interest  costs and
decrease its cash flow and earnings

         AT&T Wireless  Group may  substantially  increase its debt level in the
future, which could subject it to various restrictions and higher interest costs
and  decrease  its cash flow and  earnings.  It may also be  difficult  for AT&T
Wireless  Group to obtain all the  financing  it needs to fund its  business and
growth strategy on desirable  terms.  AT&T Wireless Group currently  anticipates
requiring  substantial  additional  financing for the foreseeable future to fund
capital  expenditures,  license  purchases  and costs and expenses in connection
with funding its  operations,  domestic and  international  investments  and its
growth strategy and in order to repay  indebtedness and preferred equity owed to
or held by AT&T and  affiliated  entities  at the time of the  split-off.  As of
December 31, 2000, the aggregate amount of this  intercompany debt and preferred
equity was approximately $5.4 billion.
<PAGE>

AT&T's  relationship  with DoCoMo contains  features that could adversely affect
the financial  condition of AT&T Wireless  Group or the way in which it conducts
its business

         The terms of the  DoCoMo  investment  enable  DoCoMo to  terminate  its
investment and require repayment of its $9.8 billion investment,  plus interest,
if AT&T Corp. does not complete the split-off of AT&T Wireless Services within a
specified  time frame or if by June 30, 2004 AT&T Wireless Group either fails to
commence  service  using  an  agreed  technology  in at  least  13 of the top 50
domestic markets or abandons wideband code division multiple access,  also known
as Universal Mobile  Telecommunications  System,  as its primary  technology for
third generation  services.  If AT&T must repay DoCoMo's  investment  before the
split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Group will fund  approximately  $6.2  billion,  plus
interest.  After the  split-off,  if DoCoMo  requires  repayment,  AT&T Wireless
Services  will  fund  the  entire  repurchase  obligation.  If  DoCoMo  requires
repayment  of its  investment,  it may  also  terminate  the  technology  rights
provided to AT&T Wireless Group in connection with its investment.

         Before  the  split-off,  AT&T will need to obtain  DoCoMo's  consent in
order to undertake a number of business actions relating to AT&T Wireless Group.
After the split-off, AT&T Wireless Services will need to obtain DoCoMo's consent
in order to make any  fundamental  change in the  nature of its  business  or to
allow  another  wireless  operator to acquire more than 15% but less than 50% of
AT&T Wireless  Services'  equity.  These limitations could prevent AT&T Wireless
Group  or  AT&T  Wireless  Services  from  taking  advantage  of  some  business
opportunities or relationships that it might otherwise pursue.

AT&T Wireless Group has substantial capital requirements that it may not be able
to fund

         AT&T  Wireless  Group's  strategy  and business  plan will  continue to
require substantial capital, which AT&T Wireless Group may not be able to obtain
or to obtain on favorable  terms.  A failure to obtain  necessary  capital would
have a material  adverse effect on AT&T Wireless Group, and result in the delay,
change or abandonment of AT&T Wireless  Group's  development or expansion  plans
and the failure to meet regulatory build-out requirements.

         AT&T Wireless Group currently  estimates that its capital  expenditures
for the build out of its networks,  including  expenditures related to its fixed
wireless  operations  during 2001,  will total  approximately  $5.5 billion,  as
compared to $4.1 billion in 2000. AT&T Wireless Group expects these 2001 capital
expenditure amounts to include approximately $5 billion of mobility expenditures
and  approximately  $450 million for fixed  wireless.  AT&T Wireless  Group also
expects to incur  substantial  capital  expenditures in future years. The actual
amount of the funds required to finance this network build out and other capital
expenditures may vary materially from management's estimate. AT&T Wireless Group
has entered into various contractual commitments associated with the development
of its third generation  strategy totaling  approximately $2.1 billion as of the
dates the  agreements  were executed.  These include  purchase  commitments  for
network  equipment.  Additionally,  AT&T Wireless Group anticipates that it will
enter into material purchase commitments in the future.

         AT&T Wireless  Group also may require  substantial  additional  capital
for, among other uses, acquisitions of providers of wireless services,  spectrum
license  or  system  acquisitions,   system  development  and  network  capacity
expansion.  AT&T Wireless Group has also entered into agreements for investments
and ventures which have required or will require substantial capital,  including
agreements  to  invest  $2.6  billion  in  exchange  for  a  combination   of  a

<PAGE>

non-controlling  equity interest in and debt securities  issued by Alaska Native
Wireless,  which was the successful  bidder for licenses  costing  approximately
$2.9 billion in the recently concluded 1900 megahertz auction.  These agreements
also may contain provisions potentially requiring substantial additional capital
in future  circumstances,  such as allowing the other  investors to require AT&T
Wireless Group to purchase assets or investments.

The actual amount of funds necessary to implement AT&T Wireless Group's business
plan may  materially  exceed  current  estimates,  which  could  have a material
adverse  effect on AT&T  Wireless  Group's  financial  condition  and results of
operations

         The actual amount of funds necessary to implement AT&T Wireless Group's
business plan may materially exceed AT&T Wireless current estimates in the event
of various factors including:

     o    departures from AT&T Wireless Group's current business plan,
     o    unforeseen delays,
     o    cost overruns,
     o    unanticipated expenses,
     o    regulatory developments,
     o    engineering design changes, and
     o    technological and other risks.

If actual costs do materially exceed AT&T Wireless Group's current estimates for
these or other  reasons,  this  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on AT&T
Wireless Group's financial condition and results of operations.

AT&T Wireless Group's significant network build out
requirements may not be completed as planned

         AT&T Wireless Group needs to complete  significant  remaining build-out
activities,  including completion of regulatorily  required build-out activities
in some of its existing wireless markets. Failure or delay to complete the build
out of the network and launch  operations,  or increased costs of this build out
and launch of operations, could have a material adverse effect on the operations
and financial condition of AT&T Wireless Group.

         As AT&T  Wireless  Group  continues to build out its network,  it must,
among other things, continue to:

     o    lease,  acquire or otherwise  obtain  rights to a large number of cell
          and switch sites,

     o    obtain zoning  variances or other local  governmental  or  third-party
          approvals or permits for network construction,

     o    complete  the radio  frequency  design,  including  cell site  design,
          frequency planning and network optimization, for each of its markets,

     o    complete the fixed network  implementation,  which includes  designing
          and   installing   network   switching    systems,    radio   systems,
          interconnecting facilities and systems, and operating support systems,
          and

     o    expand and maintain  customer care,  network  management,  billing and
          other financial and management systems.
<PAGE>

         In addition,  over the next several years,  AT&T Wireless Group will be
implementing  upgrades to its network to access the next  generation  of digital
technology.  These  events may not occur in the time frame AT&T  Wireless  Group
assumes or that the FCC requires, or at the cost AT&T Wireless Group assumes, or
at all.  Additionally,  problems  in vendor  equipment  availability,  technical
resources  or  system  performance  could  delay the  launch of new or  expanded
operations  in new or  existing  markets  or  result in  increased  costs in all
markets.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  intends  to rely  on the  services  of  various
companies that are  experienced in design and build out of wireless  networks in
order to accomplish its build out schedule. However, AT&T Wireless Group may not
be able to obtain satisfactory  contractors on economically  attractive terms or
ensure that the contractors obtained will perform as expected.

AT&T Wireless Group's business and operations would be adversely  affected if it
fails to acquire  adequate  radio  spectrum  in FCC  auctions  or through  other
transactions

         AT&T Wireless Group's  domestic  business depends on the ability to use
portions of the radio  spectrum  licensed by the FCC. AT&T Wireless  Group could
fail to obtain sufficient spectrum capacity in new and existing markets, whether
through  FCC  auctions  or other  transactions,  in  order to meet the  expanded
demands  for  existing  services,  as well as to  enable  development  of  third
generation services. This type of a failure would have a material adverse impact
on the quality of AT&T  Wireless  Group's  services  and its ability to roll out
such future services in certain markets. AT&T Wireless Group intends to continue
to acquire  more  spectrum  through a  combination  of  alternatives,  including
participation in spectrum auctions, purchase of spectrum licenses from companies
that own them or purchase of these companies outright.

         As required by law, the FCC periodically conducts auctions for licenses
to use certain parts of the radio  spectrum.  The decision to conduct  auctions,
and the  determination  of what spectrum  frequencies will be made available for
auction,  are  provided  for by laws  administered  by the FCC.  The FCC may not
allocate spectrum  sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain
licenses. Even if the FCC conducts further auctions in the future, AT&T Wireless
Group may not be successful  in those future  auctions in obtaining the spectrum
that  it  believes  is  necessary  to  implement  its  business  and  technology
strategies.

         AT&T  Wireless  Group may also seek to acquire radio  spectrum  through
purchases and swaps with other  spectrum  licensees or  otherwise,  including by
purchases of other licensees outright.  However,  AT&T Wireless Group may not be
able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions,  and it
may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.

AT&T Wireless  Group's  business and operations could be hurt if it is unable to
establish new affiliates to expand its digital network or if its existing or any
new  affiliates do not or cannot  develop  their systems in a manner  consistent
with AT&T Wireless Group's

         In order to  accelerate  the  build-out  of  widescale  coverage of the
United States by a digital mobile  wireless  network  operating on the technical
standards AT&T Wireless Group has adopted,  AT&T Wireless Group has entered into
affiliation agreements with other entities that provide wireless service or hold
spectrum licenses.  Through contractual arrangements between AT&T Wireless Group
and these affiliates, AT&T Wireless Group's customers are able to obtain service
in the affiliates' territories, and the affiliates' customers are able to obtain
service  in  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  territory.  In  all  markets  where  these

affiliates  operate,  AT&T Wireless Group is at risk because it does not control
the  affiliates.  As a result,  these  affiliates are not obligated to implement
AT&T Wireless Group's third generation  strategy.  AT&T Wireless Group's ability
to provide service on a nationwide  level and to implement its third  generation
strategy  would  be  adversely  affected  if  these  affiliates  decide  not  to
participate in the further development of AT&T Wireless Group's digital network.

         AT&T Wireless Group may establish additional affiliate relationships to
accelerate  build-out of its digital mobile  network.  If AT&T Wireless Group is
unable to establish such affiliate relationships,  or if any such affiliates are
unable or do not develop their systems in a manner consistent with AT&T Wireless
Group's  network,  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ability to service its customers and
expand  the  geographic  coverage  of its  digital  network  could be  adversely
affected.

If the FCC denies Alaska Native  Wireless'  application to acquire  licenses for
which it was the  successful  bidder in the recent  spectrum  auction or, in the
future,  revokes  licenses  awarded to Alaska  Native  Wireless,  AT&T  Wireless
Group's  ability to implement its third  generation  strategy could be adversely
affected or AT&T  Wireless  Group could  become  obligated to  repurchase  other
investors interests in Alaska Native Wireless

         AT&T Wireless Group has agreed to invest $2.6 billion in exchange for a
combination of a  non-controlling  equity interest in and debt securities issued
by Alaska Native Wireless,  which was the successful bidder for licenses costing
approximately $2.9 billion in the recently concluded 1900 megahertz auction. One
auction  participant has challenged the qualifications of Alaska Native Wireless
to acquire "closed"  licenses,  which constituted most of the licenses for which
Alaska Native  Wireless was the successful  bidder.  If the FCC determines  that
Alaska Native  Wireless was not qualified,  the FCC could refuse to grant Alaska
Native Wireless the closed licenses. If this occurs, it could have a significant
adverse impact on AT&T Wireless  Group's ability to provide or enhance  services
in key new and existing markets.

         The  Trustee  in  NextWave   Telecom,   Inc.'s  Chapter  11  bankruptcy
proceeding,  and the unsecured creditors of NextWave,  have commenced litigation
relating to the 1900 megahertz auction that could result in a delay in the grant
of licenses to successful bidders or revocation of any licenses, including those
won or acquired by Alaska Native  Wireless and cause Alaska  Native  Wireless to
postpone the development and use of any licenses  awarded to it. If this occurs,
it could have a significant  adverse  impact on AT&T  Wireless  Group's plans to
provide or enhance services in key new and existing markets.

         In specified circumstances,  if a winning bid of Alaska Native Wireless
in the recently  concluded 1900 megahertz spectrum auction is rejected or if any
license granted to it is revoked,  AT&T Wireless Group would become obligated to
compensate  other  investors  for making  capital  available to the venture.  In
specified  circumstances,  if the grant of those  licenses is  challenged,  AT&T
Wireless Group may be obligated to purchase the interests of other investors.


If AT&T Wireless Group is unable to reach  agreement with Alaska Native Wireless
regarding the  development  and use of licenses for which it was the  successful
bidder  in the  recent  spectrum  auction,  AT&T  Wireless  Group s  ability  to
implement its third generation strategy may be adversely affected

         AT&T Wireless Group has not reached any  agreements  with Alaska Native
Wireless as to whether it will  participate  in AT&T  Wireless  Group's  digital
mobile  wireless  network.  Alaska  Native  Wireless is not  obligated to use or

<PAGE>

develop  any  spectrum  it  acquires  in a  manner  which  will  further,  or be
consistent with, AT&T Wireless  Group's  strategic  objectives,  although Alaska
Native   Wireless  is  obligated  to  use  technology  that  is  compatible  and
interoperable  with AT&T Wireless  Group's digital mobile wireless  network.  If
Alaska Native  Wireless does not enter into  agreements with AT&T Wireless Group
regarding  the use and  development  of this  spectrum  similar  to  those  AT&T
Wireless Group has entered into with its affiliates for its existing network, it
could have a material adverse impact on the timing and cost of implementing AT&T
Wireless Group's third generation strategy.

Potential  acquisitions  may require AT&T  Wireless  Group to incur  substantial
additional debt and integrate new technologies,  operations and services,  which
may be costly and time consuming

         An element of AT&T Wireless  Group's strategy is to expand its network,
which AT&T Wireless Group may do through the  acquisition  of licenses,  systems
and wireless  providers.  These  acquisitions  may cause AT&T Wireless  Group to
incur  substantial  additional  indebtedness  to finance the  acquisitions or to
assume  indebtedness  of the  entities  that are  acquired.  In  addition,  AT&T
Wireless  Group  may  encounter   difficulties  in  integrating  those  acquired
operations  into  its  own  operations,  including  as  a  result  of  different
technologies,  systems, services or service offerings. These actions could prove
costly or time  consuming or divert  management's  attention from other business
matters.

Failure to develop future business  opportunities  may have an adverse effect on
AT&T Wireless Group's growth potential

         AT&T  Wireless   Group  intends  to  pursue  a  number  of  new  growth
opportunities, which involve new services for which there are no proven markets.
In addition,  the ability to deploy and deliver these services  relies,  in many
instances,  on new and  unproven  technology.  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  existing
technology  may not perform as expected and that AT&T Wireless  Group may not be
able to  successfully  develop new  technology to effectively  and  economically
deliver these services.  In addition,  these  opportunities  require substantial
capital  outlays and  spectrum  availability  to deploy on a large  scale.  This
capital or spectrum may not be available to support these services.

         Furthermore,  each of these  opportunities  entails additional specific
risks.  For  example,  the delivery of fixed  wireless  services  requires  AT&T
Wireless Group to provide installation and maintenance services,  which the AT&T
Wireless  Group has never provided  previously.  This will require AT&T Wireless
Group to hire, employ,  train and equip technicians to provide  installation and
repair  in each  market  served,  or rely on  subcontractors  to  perform  these
services.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  may not be able to hire and  train  sufficient
numbers of  qualified  employees  or  subcontract  these  services,  or do so on
economically  attractive  terms.  The success of wireless data services,  on the
other  hand,  is  substantially  dependent  on the  ability of others to develop
applications  for wireless  devices and to develop and manufacture  devices that
support  wireless  applications.  These  applications  or  devices  may  not  be
developed or developed in  sufficient  quantities  to support the  deployment of
wireless data services.

         These services may not be widely  introduced  and fully  implemented at
all or in a timely  fashion.  These services may not be successful when they are
in place, and customers may not purchase the services offered. If these services
are not successful or costs associated with implementation and completion of the
roll out of these services  materially exceed those currently  estimated by AT&T
Wireless Group, AT&T Wireless Group's financial condition and prospects could be
materially adversely affected.
<PAGE>

 AT&T Wireless Group faces substantial competition

         There is  substantial  competition  in the wireless  telecommunications
industry.  AT&T Wireless  Group expects  competition to intensify as a result of
the  entrance  of new  competitors  and  the  development  of new  technologies,
products  and  services.  Other  two-way  wireless  providers,  including  other
cellular and personal communications  services,  operators and resellers,  serve
each of the markets in which AT&T Wireless Group competes.

         A majority of markets  will have five or more  commercial  mobile radio
service  providers,  and all of the top 50  metropolitan  markets  have at least
four,  and in some  cases as many as seven  or more,  facilities-based  wireless
service   providers   offering   wireless   services   on   cellular,   personal
communications services or specialized mobile radio frequency.  Competition also
may increase to the extent that smaller, stand-alone wireless providers transfer
licenses to larger, better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers.

 Market prices for wireless services may decline in the future

         AT&T Wireless Group anticipates that market prices for two-way wireless
services generally will decline in the future due to increased  competition.  We
expect  significant  competition  among wireless  providers,  including from new
entrants, to continue to drive service and equipment prices lower. AT&T Wireless
Group also expects that there will be increases in advertising  and  promotional
spending, along with increased demands on access to distribution channels.

         All of this  may  lead  to  greater  choices  for  customers,  possible
consumer confusion,  and increasing  movement of customers between  competitors,
which we refer to as  "churn."  AT&T  Wireless  Group  may also  adopt  customer
policies or programs to be more  competitive,  which may also affect churn. AT&T
Wireless Group's ability to compete  successfully also will depend on marketing,
and on its  ability to  anticipate  and respond to various  competitive  factors
affecting the industry, including new services, changes in consumer preferences,
demographic  trends,  economic  conditions  and discount  pricing  strategies by
competitors.

Consolidation in the wireless  communications industry may adversely affect AT&T
Wireless Group

         The wireless communications industry has been experiencing  significant
consolidation  and AT&T  Wireless  Group  expects that this  consolidation  will
continue.  The previously  announced  mergers or joint ventures of Bell Atlantic
Corporation/GTE    Corporation/Vodafone    AirTouch,    now   called    Verizon,
SBC/BellSouth,   now  called  Cingular,  have  created  large,  well-capitalized
competitors with substantial financial, technical, marketing and other resources
to  respond to AT&T  Wireless  Group's  offerings.  In  addition,  in July 2000,
VoiceStream  Communications  and Deutsche Telekom  publicly  announced a planned
merger.

         These mergers or ventures have caused AT&T Wireless  Group's ranking to
decline to third in U.S.  revenue and U.S.  subscriber  share.  In terms of U.S.
population covered by licenses,  AT&T Wireless Group, including partnerships and
affiliates,  ranks third.  As a result,  these  competitors may be able to offer
nationwide  services  and plans more  quickly  and more  economically  than AT&T
Wireless  Group,  to obtain  roaming  rates that are more  favorable  than those
obtained by AT&T Wireless Group,  and may be better able to respond to offers of
AT&T Wireless Group.
<PAGE>

Significant  changes in the wireless industry could materially  adversely affect
AT&T Wireless Group

         The  wireless  communications  industry  is  experiencing   significant
technological  change.  This  change  includes  the  increasing  pace of digital
upgrades in existing  analog  wireless  systems,  evolving  industry  standards,
ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology,  shorter
development  cycles for new products,  and  enhancements and changes in end-user
needs  and   preferences   and  increased   importance  of  data  and  broadband
capabilities.

         The pace and extent of customer  demand may not  continue to  increase,
and airtime and monthly recurring charges may continue to decline.  As a result,
the future  prospects of the industry and AT&T Wireless Group and the success of
its competitive services remain uncertain.  Also,  alternative  technologies may
develop for the  provision  of services to customers  that may provide  wireless
communications  service or alternative  service  superior to that available from
AT&T  Wireless  Group.   Technological  developments  may  therefore  materially
adversely affect AT&T Wireless Group.

Termination  or impairment of AT&T Wireless  Group's  relationship  with a small
number of key suppliers could adversely  affect AT&T Wireless  Group's  revenues
and results of operations

         AT&T Wireless Group has developed  relationships with a small number of
key  vendors,  including  Nokia  Mobile  Phones,  Inc.,  Telefonaktiebolaget  LM
Ericsson,  Mitsubishi Corporation and Motorola,  Inc. for its supply of wireless
handsets,  Lucent Technologies,  Inc., Nortel Networks, Inc., Ericsson and Nokia
Networks, Inc. for its supply of telecommunications infrastructure equipment and
Convergys Information  Management Group for its billing services.  AT&T Wireless
Group does not have operational or financial control over its key suppliers, and
has limited  influence  with respect to the manner in which these key  suppliers
conduct  their  businesses.  If these key  suppliers  were unable to honor their
obligations  to AT&T  Wireless  Group,  it could  disrupt  the  business of AT&T
Wireless Group and adversely impact its revenues and results of operations.

AT&T Wireless Group's  technology may not be competitive with other technologies
or be compatible with next generation technology

         There are three existing  digital  transmission  technologies,  none of
which is compatible with the others.  AT&T Wireless Group selected time division
multiple access technology for its second generation network because it believes
that this  technology  offers several  advantages  over other second  generation
technologies.  However,  a number of other wireless service providers chose code
division  multiple  access or global system for mobile  communications  as their
digital  wireless  technology.  For its path to the next generation  technology,
AT&T  Wireless  Group  has  chosen a global  system  for  mobile  communications
platform to make  available  enhanced data services  using general  packet radio
service technology,  and third generation capabilities using enhanced data rates
for global evolution and ultimately universal mobile telecommunications  systems
technologies.

         These  technologies  may not provide the advantages AT&T Wireless Group
expects. Other wireless providers have chosen a competing wideband technology as
their third generation  technology.  If the universal mobile  telecommunications
systems  does not gain  widespread  acceptance,  it would  materially  adversely
affect the business, financial condition and prospects of AT&T Wireless Group.
<PAGE>

         As  AT&T  Wireless  Group   implements  its  plans  for  deployment  of
technology  for  third  generation  capabilities,  it  will  continue  to  incur
substantial  costs associated with maintaining its time division multiple access
networks.  Also,  these networks are not  compatible,  and customers with phones
that  operate on one network  will not  initially be able to use those phones on
the other  network.  There are risks  inherent in the  development  of new third
generation  equipment and AT&T Wireless Group may face unforeseen costs,  delays
or problems that may have a material adverse affect.

<PAGE>

AT&T Wireless Group relies on favorable  roaming  arrangements,  which it may be
unable to continue to obtain

         AT&T  Wireless  Group may not continue to be able to obtain or maintain
roaming agreements with other providers on terms that are acceptable to it. AT&T
Wireless Group's customers  automatically  can access another  provider's analog
cellular or digital  system  only if the other  provider  allows  AT&T  Wireless
Group's  customers  to  roam on its  network.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  relies  on
agreements to provide  roaming  capability to its customers in many areas of the
United  States  that  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  network  does  not  serve.   Some
competitors,  because  of their  call  volumes or their  affiliations  with,  or
ownership of, wireless providers,  however,  may be able to obtain roaming rates
that are lower than those rates obtained by AT&T Wireless Group.

         In addition,  the quality of service that a wireless  provider delivers
during a roaming  call may be inferior to the quality of service  AT&T  Wireless
Group or an affiliated company provides,  the price of a roaming call may not be
competitive  with prices of other  wireless  providers  for such call,  and AT&T
Wireless Group's  customer may not be able to use any of the advanced  features,
such as  voicemail  notification,  that the  customer  enjoys when making  calls
within AT&T Wireless  Group's network.  Finally,  AT&T Wireless Group may not be
able to obtain favorable  roaming  agreements for its third generation  products
and services that it intends to offer using the  technologies it plans to deploy
for interim enhanced data and third generation services.

AT&T  Wireless  Group's  business is seasonal  and it depends on fourth  quarter
results, which may not continue to be strong

         The wireless industry, including AT&T Wireless Group, has experienced a
trend of  generating a  significantly  higher  number of customer  additions and
handset sales in the fourth  quarter of each year as compared to the other three
fiscal  quarters.  A number of factors  contribute to this trend,  including the
increasing  use of retail  distribution,  which is  dependent  upon the year-end
holiday shopping season, the timing of new product and service announcements and
introductions,  competitive  pricing  pressures,  and  aggressive  marketing and
promotions.

         Strong fourth quarter results for customer  additions and handset sales
may not continue for the wireless  industry or for AT&T Wireless  Group.  In the
future,  the number of customer  additions  and handset  sales for AT&T Wireless
Group in the fourth  quarter could  decline for a variety of reasons,  including
AT&T  Wireless  Group's  inability  to match or beat  pricing  plans  offered by
competitors,  failure to  adequately  promote AT&T  Wireless  Group's  products,
services and pricing plans,  or failure to have an adequate  supply or selection
of handsets. If in any year fourth quarter results fail to significantly improve
upon customer  additions and handset  sales from the year's  previous  quarters,
this could  adversely  impact AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results for the following
year.

Media reports have suggested radio frequency  emissions may be linked to various
health  concerns and interfere  with various  medical  devices and AT&T Wireless
Group may be subject to potential litigation relating to these health concerns

         Media and other  reports have linked  radio  frequency  emissions  from
wireless  handsets  to  various  health  concerns,   including  cancer,  and  to
interference with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and
pacemakers. These concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage the use
of wireless  handsets or expose AT&T  Wireless  Group to  potential  litigation,
which could have a material  adverse effect on AT&T Wireless  Group's results of
operations.  Additionally, research and studies are ongoing, and may demonstrate
a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.

The  operations  of AT&T Wireless  Group are subject to  government  regulation,
which regulation could have adverse effects on its business

         The   licensing,    construction,    operation,    sale,   resale   and
interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated to
varying degrees by the FCC, and, depending on the jurisdiction,  state and local
regulatory agencies. These regulations may include, among other things, required
service features and capabilities,  such as number  portability or emergency 911
service.  In  addition,  the  FCC,  together  with  the  U.S.  Federal  Aviation
Administration  regulates  tower  marking and  lighting.  Any of these  agencies
having  jurisdiction over AT&T Wireless Group's business could adopt regulations
or take other actions that could adversely  affect the business of AT&T Wireless
Group.

         FCC licenses to provide  wireless  services or personal  communications
services are subject to renewal and  revocation.  There may be  competition  for
AT&T Wireless  Group's  licenses upon their  expiration and we cannot assure you
that the FCC will renew  them.  FCC rules  require  all  wireless  and  personal
communications services licensees to meet specified build-out requirements. AT&T
Wireless  Group  may  not be able to meet  these  requirements  in each  market.
Failure to comply with these  requirements  in a given license area could result
in revocation or  forfeiture of AT&T Wireless  Group's  license for that license
area or the imposition of fines on AT&T Wireless Group by the FCC.

State and local legislation  restricting or prohibiting wireless phone use while
driving could cause subscriber usage to decline

         Some  state and local  legislative  bodies  have  proposed  legislation
restricting  or  prohibiting  the use of wireless  phones  while  driving  motor
vehicles.  Similar  laws have been enacted in other  countries,  and, to date, a
small number of communities in the United States have passed  restrictive  local
ordinances.  If laws are passed  prohibiting or restricting  the use of wireless
phones while  driving,  it could have the effect of reducing  subscriber  usage,
which could cause a material  adverse effect on AT&T Wireless Group's results of
operations.

AT&T Wireless Group may be subject to potential  litigation  relating to the use
of wireless phones while driving

         Some studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless  phones
while driving may impair  drivers'  attention in certain  circumstances,  making
accidents  more  likely.  These  concerns  could  lead to  potential  litigation
relating to accidents,  deaths or serious bodily injuries, which also could have
material adverse effects on AT&T Wireless Group's results of operations.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO AT&T'S BUSINESS

 AT&T's business units face intense competitive pressures

         Communications Services

     o    AT&T currently faces  significant  competition in each of its consumer
          and business  communications  services business units and expects that
          the level of competition in each of these  businesses will continue to
          increase. In each of these units, AT&T faces competition from numerous
          other national and regional domestic and international companies, some
          of which have advantages over AT&T.

         Competitive  conditions  impose a  variety  of  significant  challenges
including  pressures  that  could  require  future  price  cuts and  affect  the
desirability of products and services.  These conditions create a risk of market
share loss and the risk that customers  shift to less  profitable,  lower margin
services.  Competitive  pressures  also create  challenges for AT&T's ability to
grow new  businesses or introduce new services  successfully  and execute on its
business plan,  including,  most  significantly,  the ability to purchase fairly
priced access services. Each of these business units faces the risk of potential
price cuts by its competitors that could materially adversely affect both market
share and margins.  We believe that it is unlikely that we will sustain existing
price or margin levels.

         These business units also face the risk of increasing  competition from
entities  that own their own access  facilities,  including  entities  that have
access  facilities  across vast regions of the United States with the ability to
control cost,  cycle time, and  functionality  for most  end-to-end  services in
their  regions.  These entities can preserve large market share and high margins
on access  services  as they enter new  markets,  including  long  distance  and
end-to-end services.  This places them in a superior position vis-a-vis AT&T and
other  competitors  which  must  purchase  such  high  margin  access  services.
Additionally,  each of these  business units may initiate price cuts in order to
seek to retain market share or to seek to slow decline of market share.

         The  cost   structure  of  AT&T's   business  units  also  affects  its
competitiveness. Each of these business units faces the risk that it will not be
able to maintain a competitive cost structure if newer  technologies favor newer
competitors who do not have legacy infrastructure and as technology substitution
continues.  Each of these units' ability to make critical investments to improve
cost  structure  may  also  be  impaired  by  AT&T's  current  significant  debt
obligations.

     Broadband Services

         AT&T also faces competitive risks in its Broadband  Services  business.
These risks include the growth of satellite  services,  regional bell  operating
companies  services and/or companies  providing  digital  subscriber lines which
compete directly for customers in most markets.  They also include the emergence
of new  combinations,  such as AOL Time Warner,  which seek both to  commoditize
cable access and provide their own differentiated  product, and escalating costs
for programming and other areas which may materially  adversely  affect margins.
In addition,  AT&T's  Broadband  Services  business  faces risks relating to the
acceptance and costs of potential new services.

The  regulatory  and  legislative  environment  creates  challenges  for  AT&T's
business units
<PAGE>

      Communications Services

         Each of AT&T's consumer and business  communications  services business
units faces the risk of the impact of the implementation of current  regulations
and  legislation,  unfavorable  changes in regulation or the introduction of new
onerous regulation. These risks include the impact of the following:

     o    current  law has been  implemented  in a manner  which has not allowed
          effective entry into local markets due to  non-competitive  pricing of
          access and local service and regional bell operating  company  systems
          that  do not  permit  rapid  large-scale  customer  changes  from  the
          regional bell operating companies to new service providers, and

     o    AT&T  faces  new  head-on   competition  as  regional  bell  operating
          companies begin to enter the long distance business.

         At  present,  AT&T does not believe  that many market  entry rules have
been  applied or enforced to allow the economic  viability of the various  local
market access  alternatives  or effective  large scale  management of customers.
Further,  few  facilities-based  competitors  to  the  regional  bell  operating
companies  have emerged and there is no significant  alternate  source of supply
for most access and local services. One consequence of this is that AT&T remains
ultimately  dependent on the regional  bell  operating  companies  for supply as
regional bell  operating  companies  still  represent  substantially  all of the
access and still control, cost cycle times, and functionality.

         This dependency on supply adversely  impacts both AT&T's cost structure
and its  ability to create  and  market  desirable  and  competitive  end-to-end
products  for  customers.   Absent  more  effective  application  of  rules  and
regulations,  the regional bell operating  companies will be  well-positioned to
deter new entrants to local service.

         In addition,  regional bell  operating  companies  will be entering the
long distance  business  while they still control  substantially  all the access
facilities in their  regions.  This will likely result in an increased  level of
competition for long distance or end-to-end  services as the services offered by
regional bell operating companies expand.

         Broadband Services

         In the case of  broadband  services,  the  possibility  of forced  open
access for cable plant  resulting in the  commodization  of  high-speed  data on
cable could materially  adversely affect AT&T's  business.  Also,  further cable
regulation  regarding  pricing,  ownership  limitations  and other matters could
impede growth or raise costs.

New Legislation and regulation may increase competition

         In addition,  there is the  possibility  that either new regulations or
new  legislation  will further erode the rules that apply to many of our largest
competitor and suppliers, including the regional bell operating companies. These
changes could give these companies more  streamlined  regulations  that apply to
their access  services.  These  changes could also exclude  services,  so-called
"advanced" or data  services,  from the  market-opening  rules of the applicable
legislation.  The  consequences of these changes could be to accelerate  head-on
competition  against AT&T from the regional bell operating companies in both the
communications services and broadband units.
<PAGE>

 AT&T may be adversely affected by its increased overall debt levels

         AT&T currently is pursuing  various measures to seek to reduce its debt
level. However, if these efforts cannot be completed  successfully or at levels,
on the terms and  within  the time frame  contemplated,  or if AT&T's  liquidity
needs increase as a result of further  revenue or margin  deterioration,  AT&T's
financial  condition  would be  materially  adversely  affected.  AT&T  would be
materially adversely affected by a weakening of the overall market for corporate
credit or ratings  downgrades.  AT&T's  current debt level itself may materially
adversely  affect the company and each of its business  units by  impairing  its
financial  flexibility,  its  ability  to pursue  acquisitions  or make  capital
expenditures  and  by  otherwise  impacting   investment  decisions  that  could
materially impair each unit's growth and ability to compete.

         AT&T may not be able to obtain  financing on terms that are  acceptable
to it.  AT&T's debt  ratings  have been under  review by rating  agencies.  As a
result of this review,  AT&T's ratings have been either downgraded and/or put on
credit watch with  negative  outlook.  These actions will result in an increased
cost of future  borrowings and can limit access to financing.  AT&T's failure to
complete the restructuring plan as contemplated may impact its liquidity.

         At December 31, 2000, AT&T had total  indebtedness of approximately $65
billion, with the short term portion of that at $31.9 billion. AT&T's ability to
meet these  obligations  depend upon its credit ratings,  market  conditions and
business  results.  AT&T continues to investigate  and negotiate other financing
alternatives  including the monetization of publicly held  securities,  sales of
certain  non-strategic  assets and investments,  and  securitization  of certain
accounts  receivable,  as well as a $6.5 billion debt  offering by AT&T Wireless
Services in the first quarter  2001.  AT&T has increased its $10 billion line of
credit to $25 billion, which was subsequently reduced to $18.4 billion following
the DoCoMo investment and the AT&T Wireless Services debt offering. In addition,
AT&T plans to retire a portion of the short-term  debt with all or a part of the
funds from a planned  2001  offering  of a  security  intended  to  reflect  the
financial performance and economic value of AT&T's Broadband unit, although that
offering may not occur as expected.

AT&T may be adversely affected by further ratings downgrades

         AT&T's senior debt ratings and two of its short-term  debt ratings were
reduced in late 2000 by Standard & Poor's Rating Services to A andA1; by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. to A2 andP1; and by Fitch, Inc. to A-and F1. Both AT&T's
short-term and long-term  ratings  remain under review for further  downgrade at
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.

         Late last year, AT&T initiated a debt reduction plan,  against which it
has  continued  to make  progress.  However,  at the  same  time,  AT&T has seen
deterioration in the results of its core communication  services businesses.  It
is unclear as to how the rating  agencies  will balance  these  developments  in
their  ratings  assessment,  but there is a  material  risk  that AT&T  could be
further  downgraded.  We expect to review  with the rating  agencies in the near
future the financial  results and long-term  financial  projections  of the AT&T
businesses  to be  separated.  A ratings  action  could  occur in advance of the
meetings, during the meeting period, or following the meetings.

         If AT&T  were to be  further  downgraded,  access to  capital  could be
disrupted and the cost of capital would likely increase.  AT&T has access to the
commercial  paper market  today which is  sufficient  to satisfy its  short-term
borrowing  needs.  In the  event of a further  short-term  rating  downgrade  or

<PAGE>

downgrades,  the level of  issuance  capacity  available  to AT&T  would  likely
contract and could be exceeded by our short-term  borrowing needs. In this case,
AT&T could access the $25 billion bank credit  facility put in place on December
28, 2000 to serve as a commercial  paper back-up  source of  liquidity.  The $25
billion bank credit  facility was reduced to $18.3 billion  during March 2001 as
we made  progress  in our  deleveraging  efforts.  The  cost  of any  short-term
borrowing  under the bank  facility  would  likely  be  higher  than the cost of
commercial  paper  borrowings for AT&T today, and could be even higher depending
upon market  conditions.  In addition,  the access to this bank facility extends
only until December 28, 2001 and could be reduced to as low as $10 billion if we
continue to make progress in our  deleveraging  efforts.  To the extent that the
combined  outstanding  short-term  borrowings under the bank credit facility and
AT&T's  commercial  paper  program  were to exceed the market  capacity for such
borrowings  at the  expiration  of the bank credit  facility,  AT&T's  continued
liquidity would depend upon our ability to reduce such short-term debt through a
combination  of  capital  market  borrowings,   asset  sales,  operational  cash
generation,  capital  expenditure  reduction  and other  means.  Our  ability to
achieve such  objectives  is subject to a risk of execution  and such  execution
could materially impact AT&T's operational results. In addition, the cost of any
capital market financing could be  significantly in excess of AT&T's  historical
financing costs. Also, AT&T could suffer negative banking,  investor, and public
relations  repercussions  if we were to draw  upon the bank  facility,  which is
intended to serve as a back-up  source of liquidity  only.  Such  impacts  could
cause further deterioration in our cost and access to capital.

         Furthermore, according to the terms of the bank credit facility, AT&T's
ability to split off AT&T Wireless  Group is contingent  upon AT&T's senior debt
rating, as determined by Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service,  not
falling  below BBB+ and Baa1,  respectively.  Failure to split off AT&T Wireless
Group by early  2002  would  permit  NTT  DoCoMo  to  elect to  require  AT&T to
repurchase its interest in AT&T for an aggregate  purchase price of $9.8 billion
plus  a  predetermined   rate  of  interest,   which  could  further  limit  the
availability and increase the cost of financing.

AT&T may not be able to attract and retain management

         AT&T's business units face other risks,  including risks related to the
difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees, particularly
in the consumer and business communications services units. There is also a risk
that it will be more difficult to attract,  retain and motivate key employees as
growth declines and opportunities and compensation  become limited and after the
restructuring  is completed as desired  hires may be less  interested in working
for smaller companies.

AT&T may be unable to engage in potentially desirable strategic transactions

         AT&T from time to time explores strategic  alternatives with respect to
some of its assets and businesses and may engage in discussions or  negotiations
with third parties regarding these possible transactions.

         For example,  AT&T owns an approximately  25.5% interest in Time Warner
Entertainment,  L.P., which AT&T has previously  announced it intends to divest.
This  interest  is not part of or  allocated  to the  AT&T  Wireless  Group.  On
February  28, 2001,  AT&T  exercised  registration  rights it has under the Time
Warner Entertainment  partnership  agreement,  to have Time Warner Entertainment
reconstitute  itself as a  corporation  and then to  register  up to AT&T's full
interest  for  sale  in an  initial  public  offering.  Under  the  Time  Warner
Entertainment partnership agreement, Time Warner Entertainment may determine not

<PAGE>

to effect a public offering but instead to allow AT&T certain put rights to have
Time Warner  Entertainment buy back the shares that would have been sold in such
an offering at an appraised price. AT&T is simultaneously  pursuing  discussions
with AOL Time  Warner  concerning  alternative  potential  arrangements  for the
redemption of AT&T's partnership  interest in Time Warner  Entertainment as well
as certain commercial arrangements with AOL Time Warner.

         We cannot predict whether these discussions will continue,  whether any
of these  transactions  will be completed or the timing or terms of any of these
transactions.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO AT&T CORP.'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN

AT&T Corp.'s  restructuring plan requires  fundamental changes to our businesses
that may be hard to implement

         If we complete our restructuring plan, each of our four businesses will
need to make changes in its operations that will require  substantial effort and
involve  substantial  risks and costs.  If any of these  businesses is unable to
make this transition smoothly or is not able to operate as effectively after the
restructuring, the financial position and results of operations of that business
could suffer and cause the trading value of  securities  intended to reflect the
financial performance and economic value of that business to decline materially.

The total value of the securities issued in our restructuring plan might be less
than the value of AT&T common stock without that plan

         If we complete  our  restructuring  plan as we  currently  contemplate,
holders of AT&T common  stock who do not dispose of their  shares of AT&T common
stock  eventually will receive  securities  issued by or intended to reflect the
financial  performance  and economic  value of four  businesses:  AT&T  Business
Services, AT&T Consumer Services, AT&T Broadband and AT&T Wireless Services. The
aggregate value of these shares could be less than what the value of AT&T common
stock would be without  AT&T's  restructuring.  The trading price of AT&T common
stock may decline as a result of the implementation of AT&T's restructuring plan
or as a result of other factors.

         If we  complete  the  restructuring,  these new  securities  will begin
trading  publicly for the first time.  Until orderly trading markets develop for
each of  these  new  securities,  and  after  that  time as well,  there  may be
significant  fluctuations in price. Also, we have not yet determined many of the
details  of  AT&T's  restructuring  plan  and  these  details  could  materially
adversely  impact the value of AT&T common stock or AT&T Wireless Group tracking
stock.

If we do not complete AT&T's restructuring plan as we plan, there may be adverse
consequences to AT&T and AT&T Wireless Group

         AT&T's  restructuring  plan is complicated,  and involves a substantial
number of steps and transactions.  The  implementation  of AT&T's  restructuring
plan will  require  various  approvals  and be subject  to  various  conditions,
including  IRS  rulings.  In addition,  future  financial  conditions,  superior
alternatives  or other  factors may arise or occur that make it  inadvisable  to
proceed  with  part or all of AT&T's  restructuring  plan.  If we are  unable to
complete AT&T's restructuring plan as we expect, or the implementation of AT&T's
restructuring  plan is more complex  than we expect,  this could have a material
adverse effect on AT&T,  its business or the trading  prices of its  securities.
Any or all of the  elements  of  AT&T's  restructuring  plan may not occur as we

<PAGE>

currently expect or in the time frames that we currently contemplate, or at all.
Alternative  forms  of  restructuring,  including  sales of  interests  in these
businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution to shareholders in
the restructuring.

AT&T's  restructuring  may adversely  impact the competitive  position of AT&T's
business units

         In  connection  with the  restructuring,  there is a risk  that  AT&T's
separated  business  units  may  not be able to  create  effective  intercompany
agreements to facilitate effective cost sharing or enter into mutually desirable
bundling arrangements.  Competition between AT&T's units in overlapping markets,
including  the consumer  markets  where cable  telephone,  fixed  wireless,  and
digital  subscriber  line  solutions  may all be  available  at the  same  time,
although  generally not all under the AT&T brand,  could result in more downward
price pressure.  It is expected that the different businesses and companies will
share the AT&T brand after the  restructuring,  which will likely  increase this
level of  competition.  In  addition,  any  incremental  costs  associated  with
implementing  AT&T's  restructuring  plan may  materially  adversely  affect the
different businesses and companies.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE AT&T WIRELESS GROUP SPLIT-OFF

We may not complete the AT&T Wireless Group split-off as we plan

         We intend to separate  AT&T  Wireless  Group from AT&T in the middle of
2001, but the split-off is subject to a number of  conditions.  We must obtain a
favorable  IRS ruling,  which we may not receive.  In  addition,  AT&T's new $25
billion credit facility includes as conditions to the split-off that it maintain
a public debt rating for its long-term  senior debt of at least BBB+ by Standard
& Poor's Rating Services and Baa1 by Moody's Investors  Services,  Inc. and that
AT&T Wireless Group repay intercompany  obligations to AT&T,  including debt and
preferred  equity which  totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2000.  In order to
facilitate the receipt of the IRS ruling, we have undertaken a reorganization of
our  business  structure  which  requires  receipt  of various  local  franchise
regulatory  approvals.  While we currently intend to complete the split-off,  we
may not be able to satisfy  these  conditions  to the  split-off.  Even if we do
satisfy these conditions,  other events or circumstances,  including litigation,
could  occur that  could  affect  the  timing or terms of the  split-off  or our
ability  or  plans  to  complete  the  split-off.  For  example,  several  large
shareholders  of AT&T  associated with unions that represent AT&T employees have
publicly announced their opposition to AT&T's restructuring plan. As a result of
these  factors,  the split-off  may not occur and, if it does occur,  it may not
occur  on  the  terms  or  in  the  manner  described,  or  in  the  time  frame
contemplated.  In this  event,  there may be adverse  consequences,  such as the
obligation to repurchase DoCoMo's investment in AT&T, or limits on AT&T Wireless
Group's capital funding, as described below.

 AT&T's  intention to retain $3 billion of shares of AT&T Wireless  Services for
sale,  exchange or monetization  after the split-off could adversely  affect the
market value of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock

         AT&T currently  intends to retain $3 billion of shares of AT&T Wireless
Services  for its own account  for sale,  exchange  or  monetization  within six
months of the split-off,  subject to a satisfactory IRS ruling. If AT&T does so,
the sale of  these  shares  could  adversely  affect  the  market  price of AT&T
Wireless  Services common stock. In addition,  AT&T's  retention of these shares
would  reduce  the  number  of shares of AT&T  Wireless  Services  that we would
distribute to holders of AT&T common stock in the split-off.
<PAGE>

If we do not complete the split-off by early 2002 or if AT&T Wireless Group does
not meet specified  technology  benchmarks,  AT&T or AT&T Wireless  Services may
have to repurchase DoCoMo's $9.8 billion investment

         In connection  with DoCoMo's  investment in AT&T,  AT&T has agreed,  if
DoCoMo so elects,  to  repurchase  DoCoMo's  interest  in AT&T for an  aggregate
purchase price of $9.8 billion plus a  predetermined  interest rate if AT&T does
not complete the split-off of AT&T  Wireless  Group by January 1, 2002, or March
15, 2002 if AT&T is trying to obtain an IRS ruling,  or if by June 30, 2004 AT&T
Wireless Group either fails to commence service using an agreed technology in at
least 13 of the top 50  domestic  markets or  abandons  wideband  code  division
multiple access as its primary technology for third generation services.  Before
the split-off,  AT&T Wireless Group would be required to fund its  proportionate
share,  consisting  of $6.2 billion plus  interest.  After the  split-off,  AT&T
Wireless  Services would be required to fund the entire  repurchase  obligation,
with AT&T  being  secondarily  liable for $3.6  billion  plus  interest  if AT&T
Wireless Services is unable to satisfy the entire obligation.

If we do not complete the split-off, AT&T Wireless Group may not be able to meet
its substantial capital needs that are key to its business strategy

         AT&T's  desire to reduce debt levels and  maintain  its overall  credit
rating  limits the  ability of each of AT&T's  business  units,  including  AT&T
Wireless Group, to incur substantial indebtedness. As a result, if the split-off
does not  occur in the time  frame  contemplated,  and AT&T  does not  otherwise
succeed in deleveraging  by disposition of assets and other debt  restructuring,
AT&T Wireless Group may face significant capital constraints.  These constraints
would make it difficult for AT&T Wireless Group to continue to pursue its growth
strategy in a capital intensive and highly  competitive  industry,  including by
making it  necessary  to scale  back  plans for third  generation  services  and
international investments.  These constraints may have a material adverse effect
on AT&T Wireless Group's business.

If we  complete  the  split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Services  will  need to obtain
financing on a stand-alone basis

         Historically, all financing for AT&T Wireless Group was done by AT&T at
the parent level.  AT&T was able to use its overall balance sheet to finance the
operations of AT&T Wireless Group.  If we complete the split-off,  AT&T Wireless
Services will have to raise financing on a stand-alone  basis without  reference
to AT&T's overall balance sheet. Following the split-off, AT&T Wireless Services
may not be able to secure adequate debt or equity  financing on desirable terms.
If concerns  generally  affecting  the wireless  industry  arise,  AT&T Wireless
Services will lose the benefit of AT&T's  current  diverse  business  profile to
support its debt. The cost to AT&T Wireless  Services of  stand-alone  financing
may be materially  higher than the cost of financing  that AT&T  Wireless  Group
incurred as part of AT&T.

         The credit  ratings of AT&T  Wireless  Services are  currently  and may
continue  to be  different  than  the  historical  ratings  of AT&T.  After  the
split-off,  AT&T Wireless  Services'  credit  ratings may be different from what
they are now.  Differences in credit ratings affect the interest rate charged on
financings,  as  well  as  the  amounts  of  indebtedness,  types  of  financing
structures  and debt markets that may be  available to AT&T  Wireless  Services.
AT&T  Wireless  Services  may not be able to raise the  capital it  requires  on
desirable terms.

 If we complete the split-off,  AT&T Wireless Services may be unable to make the
changes  necessary  to operate as an  independent  entity and may incur  greater
costs
<PAGE>

         AT&T  Wireless  Group  historically  has  been  part  of an  integrated
telecommunications  provider  since  its  acquisition  by  AT&T in  1994.  If we
complete the split-off,  the separation of AT&T Wireless Services from the other
telecommunications  businesses  of  AT&T  may  adversely  affect  AT&T  Wireless
Services.

         In particular, following the split-off, AT&T will have no obligation to
provide  financial,  operational or  organizational  assistance to AT&T Wireless
Services other than limited services.  AT&T Wireless Services may not be able to
implement  successfully  the changes  necessary to operate  independently.  AT&T
Wireless  Services  may  also  incur  additional  costs  relating  to  operating
independently  that  would  cause its cash flow and  results  of  operations  to
decline materially. In addition,  although AT&T Wireless Services may be able to
participate in some of AT&T's  supplier  arrangements  where those  arrangements
permit this or the vendors agree to this, its supplier  arrangements  may not be
as favorable as has historically been the case.

         Agreements to be entered into in connection with the split-off  provide
that the business of AT&T Wireless Group will be conducted  differently and that
its  relationship  with AT&T will be different from that which has  historically
been the case. These differences may have a detrimental effect on the results of
operations or financial condition of AT&T or AT&T Wireless Services.

The  historical  financial  information  of  AT&T  Wireless  Group  may  not  be
representative of its results as an independent entity, and, therefore,  may not
be reliable as an indicator of its historical or future results

         The historical financial  information we have included and incorporated
in this  document  may not  reflect  what the results of  operations,  financial
position  and cash flows of AT&T  Wireless  Group would have been had it been an
independent  entity during the periods  presented.  This is because the combined
financial  statements reflect allocations for services provided to AT&T Wireless
Group by AT&T,  which  allocations may not reflect the costs AT&T Wireless Group
will incur for similar or incremental services as an independent entity.

         This  historical  financial  information  also  is not  reliable  as an
indicator of future results.

If we complete the  split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Services'  financing  needs will
increase as a result of intercompany repayment obligations

         Before  the   split-off,   AT&T   Wireless   Services  will  repay  all
intercompany  indebtedness owed to AT&T and will redeem all of the AT&T Wireless
Group preferred equity held by AT&T. As of December 31, 2000, these amounts were
approximately  $2.4 billion and $3.0 billion,  respectively,  or an aggregate of
approximately $5.4 billion.

If  we  complete  the  split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Services  will  generally  be
responsible for tax liability if the split-off is taxable
<PAGE>

         Under the  separation  and  distribution  agreement  to be entered into
between AT&T and AT&T Wireless  Services,  subject to limited  exceptions,  AT&T
Wireless  Services  will be  responsible  for any tax  liability and any related
liability  that  results  from the  split-off  failing  to qualify as a tax-free
transaction,  subject to limited exceptions.  If the split-off failed to qualify
as a tax-free  transaction,  this liability would have a material adverse effect
on AT&T Wireless Group.

AT&T Wireless Group may no longer receive tax sharing payments from AT&T when it
ceases  to be a member  of the AT&T  consolidated  tax  return  group,  and AT&T
Wireless Group may incur other tax  liabilities as a result of the split-off and
pre-split-off transactions

         As a result of the split-off, AT&T Wireless Services will cease to be a
member of the consolidated  federal income tax return group of which AT&T is the
common parent. Consequently, taxable income and losses, and other tax attributes
of AT&T Wireless  Group in post  split-off  taxable  periods could  generally no
longer  offset  taxable  income or losses and other tax  attributes  of the AT&T
consolidated tax return group. For two taxable years after the split-off,  under
federal income tax rules,  AT&T Wireless Group would  generally be able to carry
back any such tax losses,  subject to limitations,  against  taxable income,  if
any, of members of AT&T Wireless Group for pre split-off periods.  Under the tax
sharing agreement between AT&T and AT&T Wireless Group,  however,  AT&T Wireless
Group  generally  may only carry back net  operating  losses  (and not other tax
attributes)  from  post  split-off  taxable  periods  to pre  split-off  taxable
periods,  and only if those losses are significant and with the consent of AT&T,
which consent AT&T has agreed not to withhold  unreasonably.  To the extent AT&T
Wireless  Group  has tax  losses in post  split-off  taxable  periods,  it would
generally no longer receive  current tax sharing  payments with respect to those
losses. Instead, except where those losses can be carried back, it would benefit
from those  losses only if and when AT&T  Wireless  Group  generated  sufficient
taxable  income in future  years to utilize  those tax  losses on a  stand-alone
basis.

         In addition,  there may be tax costs associated with the split-off that
result  from  AT&T  Wireless  Services  ceasing  to  be a  member  of  the  AT&T
consolidated tax return group, as well as from  pre-split-off  transactions.  If
incurred, these costs could be material to AT&T Wireless Services' results.

If we complete the split-off,  various  factors may interfere with AT&T Wireless
Services'  ability  to engage in  desirable  strategic  transactions  and equity
issuances

         AT&T  Wireless  Services  may not be able to engage  in some  strategic
transactions  after the  split-off.  The  Internal  Revenue Code  restricts  the
ability of a company  which has  undergone  a tax-free  split-off  from  certain
issuances of shares generally  within a two-year period after the split-off.  In
addition,  the separation  and  distribution  agreement  prohibits AT&T Wireless
Services for a period of 30 months  following the split-off,  from entering into
certain  transactions  that  could  render  the  split-off  taxable.   This  may
discourage,  delay or prevent a merger, change of control, or other strategic or
capital  raising  transaction  involving the issuance of equity by AT&T Wireless
Services.  Provisions of AT&T Wireless  Services charter and bylaws,  its rights
plan,  applicable  law,  and the DoCoMo  agreements  may also have the effect of
discouraging,  delaying or preventing  change of control  transactions  that its
shareholders find desirable.

 If we complete  the  split-off,  AT&T  Wireless  Services may lose rights under
agreements with AT&T if a change of control occurs
<PAGE>

         We expect  that  some of the  agreements  that  AT&T and AT&T  Wireless
Services  expect to enter into in connection  with the split-off,  including the
brand  license  agreement,  network  services  agreement  and  other  commercial
agreements, will contain provisions that give one party rights in the event of a
change  of  control  of the other  party  that  triggered  these  rights.  These
provisions  may deter a change of control.  In the event of a change of control,
the  exercise  of these  rights  could  have a material  adverse  effect on AT&T
Wireless Services or AT&T.

The market price and trading volume of AT&T Wireless Services common stock maybe
volatile and may face negative pressure

         Before the split-off, there will be no trading market for the shares of
AT&T Wireless  Services  common stock that holders of AT&T common stock and AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock will receive in the split-off. Investors' interest
may not lead to a liquid  trading  market and the market price of AT&T  Wireless
Services common stock may be volatile. Also, after the split-off, the percentage
of AT&T  Wireless  Services  represented  by publicly  held shares will increase
materially.

         AT&T has announced its intention to retain $3 billion of shares of AT&T
Wireless Services for its own account for sale,  exchange or monetization within
six months of the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory IRS ruling.

         These  factors may result in short- or long-term  negative  pressure on
the trading price of shares of AT&T Wireless  Services common stock.  The market
price of AT&T Wireless  Services common stock could fluctuate  significantly for
many reasons, including in response to the special considerations listed in this
document or for specific  reasons  unrelated to the performance of AT&T Wireless
Services.  Investors  may  consider  AT&T  Wireless  Services  common stock as a
technology stock.  Technology stocks have recently experienced extreme price and
volume  fluctuations.  Therefore,  the market  price and trading  volume of AT&T
Wireless Services common stock also may be extremely volatile.

     -    other matters.
<PAGE>

Statements  in  this  Form  10-K  that  are  not  historical  facts  are  hereby
identified as "forward  looking  statements"  for the purpose of the safe harbor
provided  by Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. Any Form 10-K,  Annual Report to Shareholders,
Form  10-Q or Form  8-K of AT&T  may  include  forward  looking  statements.  In
addition,  other written or oral  statements  which  constitute  forward looking
statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of AT&T,
including,  without limitation, those relating to the future business prospects,
revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, network build out, interest
costs and income, in each case,  relating to AT&T Corp., AT&T Common Stock Group
and AT&T  Wireless  Group.  These forward  looking  statements  are  necessarily
estimates  reflecting  the best  judgment  of senior  management  that rely on a
number of assumptions  concerning  future  events,  many of which are outside of
AT&T's control, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the  forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in
light of various important factors, including those set forth in this Form 10-K.
Important  factors that could cause  actual  results to differ  materially  from
estimates or projections  contained in the  forward-looking  statements include,
without limitation:

     o    the risks  associated with the  implementation  of a  third-generation
          network and business strategy for AT&T Wireless Group, including risks
          relating  to  the   operations   of  new  systems  and   technologies,
          substantial required  expenditures and potential  unanticipated costs,
          the  need  to  enter  into  roaming  agreements  with  third  parties,
          uncertainties regarding the adequacy of suppliers on whom these groups
          must rely to provide both network and consumer  equipment and consumer
          acceptance of the products and services to be offered,

     o    the potential impact of DoCoMo's  investment in AT&T Corp.,  including
          provisions of the  agreements  that  restrict  AT&T  Wireless  Group's
          future  operations,  and provisions that may require the repurchase of
          DoCoMo's  investment if AT&T Corp. or AT&T Wireless Group fail to meet
          specified conditions,

     o    the  risks  associated  with  the   implementation   of  AT&T  Corp.'s
          restructuring   plan,  which  is  complicated  and  which  involves  a
          substantial  number  of  different  transactions  each  with  separate
          conditions,  any or all of which may not occur as we currently intend,
          or which may not occur in the timeframe we currently expect,

     o    the risks  associated  with each of AT&T Corp.'s main business  units,
          including AT&T Wireless Group,  operating as an independent  entity as
          opposed  to as  part  of  an  integrated  telecommunications  provider
          following completion of AT&T Corp.'s restructuring plan, including the
          inability of these  groups to rely on the  financial  and  operational
          resources of the combined  company and these groups  having to provide
          services  that were  previously  provided by a  different  part of the
          combined company,

o        the impact of  existing  and new  competitors  in the  markets in which
         these  groups  compete,  including  competitors  that  may  offer  less
         expensive  products and  services,  desirable or  innovative  products,
         technological  substitutes,  or  have  extensive  resources  or  better
         financing;

     o    the introduction or popularity of new products and services, including
          pre-paid phone products in the case of wireless services,  which could
          increase churn,
<PAGE>

     o    the  impact  of  oversupply  of  capacity   resulting  from  excessive
          deployment of network capacity,

     o    the ongoing  global and domestic  trend towards  consolidation  in the
          telecommunications industry, which trend may have the effect of making
          the   competitors   larger  and  better   financed  and  afford  these
          competitors  with extensive  resources and greater  geographic  reach,
          allowing them to compete more effectively,

     o    the  effects of  vigorous  competition  in the  markets in which these
          groups operate and for each group's more valuable customers, which may
          decrease  prices  charged,  increase  churn  and  change  the  group's
          customer mix, profitability and average revenue per user,

     o    the  ability  to enter into  agreements  to  provide,  and the cost of
          entering new markets necessary to provide, nationwide services,

     o    the  ability  to  establish  a  significant  market  presence  in  new
          geographic and service markets,

     o    the availability and cost of capital and the consequences of increased
          leverage,

     o    successful  execution of plans to dispose of  non-strategic  assets as
          part of an overall corporate deleveraging plan,

     o    the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing  evaluations of
          the business strategies of these groups,

     o    the  requirements  imposed  on these  groups or  latitude  allowed  to
          competitors  by the FCC or  state  regulatory  commissions  under  the
          Telecommunications   Act  of  1996  or  other   applicable   laws  and
          regulations,

     o    the risks and costs  associated  with the need to  acquire  additional
          spectrum for current and future services,

     o    the  risks  associated  with  technological  requirements,  technology
          substitution and changes and other technological developments,

     o    the results of litigation filed or to be filed against these groups,

     o    the  possibility  of one or more of the markets in which these  groups
          compete  being  impacted  by changes in  political,  economic or other
          factors,  such as monetary  policy,  legal and  regulatory  changes or
          other external factors over which these groups have no control,

statements  about  the  matters  described  in this  document  or other  matters
concerning  AT&T Corp.,  AT&T  Wireless  Group or AT&T Common Stock Group.  AT&T
Corp.  undertakes  no  obligation  to publicly  release any  revisions  to these

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

         The properties of AT&T Corp.  consist  primarily of plant and equipment
used to provide long distance and wireless telecommunications services and cable
television services and administrative office buildings.  AT&T's owns and leases
properties to support its offices, facilities and equipment.

         Telecommunications  plant and  equipment  consists of:  central  office
equipment,  including  switching and  transmission  equipment;  connecting lines
(cables,  wires,  poles,  conduits,  etc.);  wireless  cell sites,  antennas and
wireless switching facilities;  land and buildings; and miscellaneous properties
(work equipment, furniture, plant under construction, etc.). The majority of the
connecting  lines  are on or  under  public  roads,  highways  and  streets  and
international  and  territorial  waters.  The  remainder are on or under private
property. Physical cable television properties, which are located throughout the
United  States,  consist of system  components,  motor  vehicles,  miscellaneous
hardware, spare parts and other components. AT&T also operates a number of sales
offices,  customer  care  centers,  and other  facilities,  such as research and
development laboratories.

         AT&T continues to manage the  deployment and  utilization of its assets
in order to meet its global  growth  objectives  while at the same time ensuring
that these assets are generating value for the  shareholder.  AT&T will continue
to manage its asset base consistent with globalization initiatives,  marketplace
forces, productivity growth and technology change.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

         In the normal course of business, AT&T Corp. is subject to proceedings,
lawsuits and other  claims,  including  proceedings  under  government  laws and
regulations related to environmental and other matters. Such matters are subject
to  many   uncertainties  and  outcomes  are  not  predictable  with  assurance.
Consequently, AT&T Corp. is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of
monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters at December
31, 2000. While these matters could affect operating  results of any one quarter
when resolved in future  periods,  it is  management's  opinion that after final
disposition,  any monetary  liability or financial  impact to AT&T Corp.  beyond
that  provided  for at year-end  would not be material  to AT&T  Corp.'s  annual
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

         The  Company  has  been  named  as a  defendant  in  several  purported
securities  class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Courts for
the District of New Jersey and for the Southern District of New York purportedly
filed on behalf of persons who  purchased  securities of the Company for various
periods from October 25, 1999 through May 1, 2000.  These lawsuits assert claims
under Section 11 of the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 10(b)
and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and allege, among
other  things,  that  during the  period  referenced  above,  the  Company  made
materially  false and misleading  statements and omitted to state material facts
concerning  its future  business  prospects.  The  complaints  seek  unspecified
damages. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and intends to
defend them vigorously.
<PAGE>

         Several  lawsuits have been filed  asserting  claims that AT&T Wireless
Group collected  charges for local government taxes from customers that were not
properly  subject to those  charges.  AT&T  Wireless  Group has  entered  into a
settlement of one of these cases, although the settlement has been challenged on
appeal. AT&T Wireless Group has asserted in those cases that any recovery should
come from the municipalities to which the taxes were paid.

         Several class action lawsuits have been filed in which claims have been
asserted that AT&T Wireless  Group did not have  suffcient  network  capacity to
support the influx of new  subscribers  who signed up for AT&T  Digital One Rate
service  beginning in May 1998 and therefore has failed to provide  service of a
quality  allegedly  promised to subscribers.  The plaintiffs in these cases have
not asserted  specific claims for damages,  with the exception of one case filed
in Texas in which the named plaintiffs have asserted claims for compensatory and
punitive damages totaling $100 million.

         Several other class action or  representative  lawsuits have been filed
against  AT&T  Wireless  Group that  allege,  depending  on the case,  breach of
contract,  misrepresentation or unfair practice claims relating to AT&T Wireless
Group's billing  practices  (including  rounding up of partial minutes of use to
full minute increments and billing send to end), coverage,  dropped calls, price
fixing and/or  mistaken  bills.  Although the plaintiffs in these cases have not
specified alleged damages, the damages in two of the cases are alleged to exceed
$100  million.  One of these two  cases  was  dismissed  and the  dismissal  was
affirmed in part on appeal. Settlement negotiations are ongoing in both cases.

         AT&T Wireless Group is involved in litigation in which the Cellular One
Group  claims  that  use of the  name  ""AT&T  Digital  One  Rate"  infringes  a
trademarked  name,  ""DIGITALONE"  for which the Cellular One Group has obtained
trademark  registration.  The  Cellular One Group has not  specified  amounts of
claimed damages.

         AT&T Wireless Group is involved in a patent infringement action against
GTE in the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington. GTE claims that the Nokia
phones   manufactured  for  AT&T  Wireless  Group  infringe  a  GTE  patent  for
over-the-air  activation and  over-the-air  programming.  AT&T Wireless Group is
seeking a declaratory judgment that its use of over-the-air  activation does not
infringe GTE's patent. GTE has not specified amounts of claimed damages.

         Stockholders   of  a  former   competitor   of  AT&T   Wireless   Group
air-to-ground  business are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in 1993, alleging that
AT&T Wireless Group breached a confidentiality  agreement, used trade secrets to
unfairly  compete,  and  tortiously  interfered  with the business and potential
business of the competitor.  Plaintiffs sought damages in an unspecified  amount
in excess of $3.5 billion. AT&T Wireless Group obtained partial summary judgment
and then  prevailed on the remainder of the claims at a trial on the validity of
a release of plaintiffs'  claims.  Final judgment was entered against plaintiffs
on their claims,  and plaintiffs  appealed.  On appeal,  the Appellate  Court of
Illinois,  Second District,  reversed and remanded the case for trial indicating
that certain issues decided by the judge needed to be resolved by a jury.

         AT&T  Wireless  Group  is  vigorously  defending  each  of  the  claims
described  above.  AT&T Wireless Group cannot predict the final outcome of these
disputes.

         AT&T is also a named party in a number of environmental  actions,  none
of which is material to the consolidated financial statements or business of the
Company. In addition,  pursuant to the Separation and Distribution  Agreement by

<PAGE>

and among AT&T,  Lucent,  and NCR, dated as of February 1, 1996, and amended and
restated  as of March 29,  1996,  Lucent has assumed  liability,  subject to the
liability sharing provisions of that agreement, for a number of actions in which
AT&T remains a named  party.  AT&T is working to be released as a party to these
actions,  although  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this
regard.

         There  are four  environmental  proceedings  which are  required  to be
reported  pursuant to  Instruction  5.C. of Item 103 of Regulation  S-K; for the
first three below,  Lucent has assumed liability,  as described above. First, on
July 31, 1991,  the United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency Region III
issued a complaint  pursuant to Section 3008a of the Resource  Conservation  and
Recovery Act alleging violations of various waste management  regulations at the
Company's  Richmond Works,  Richmond,  Virginia.  The complaint seeks a total of
$4.2  million  in  penalties.  Second,  on July  31,  1991,  the  United  States
Environmental  Protection  Agency filed a civil  complaint in the U.S.  District
Court for the Southern  District of Illinois  against the Company and nine other
parties  seeking  enforcement  of  its  Comprehensive   Environmental  Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")  Section 106 cleanup order,  issued in
November 1990 for the NL Granite City Superfund site,  Granite,  Illinois,  past
costs,  civil penalties of $25,000 per day and treble damages related to certain
United  States'  costs.  Third,  during  1994,  AT&T Nassau  Metals  Corporation
("Nassau"), a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T, and the New York State Department
of  Environmental  Conservation  ("NYSDEC") were engaged in negotiations  over a
study and cleanup of the Nassau plant located on Richmond  Valley Road in Staten
Island,  New York.  During these  negotiations,  in June 1994,  NYSDEC presented
Nassau with a draft consent order that included not only provisions  relating to
site  investigation  and  remediation but also a provision for payment of a $3.5
million   penalty  for  alleged   violations  of  hazardous   waste   management
regulations.  No formal proceeding has been commenced by NYSDEC.  Last, the U.S.
Department of Justice is using a grand jury sitting in the District Court of the
Virgin Islands to investigate the purported 1996 release of non-toxic  bentonite
drilling mud within the coastal  region of St. Croix.  Requests for documents or
testimony  or both have been  directed  to  numerous  entities  including  AT&T,
affiliated   companies,   contractors  involved  in  the  work,  and  individual
employees.  The  prosecutor  contemplates  seeking  criminal  penalties or other
sanctions  from any party that evidence  suggests  either  knowingly  discharged
pollutants  in  violation  of permits or  knowingly  made  false  statements  in
violation of federal law.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


OVERVIEW

         AT&T Corp.  (AT&T or the  company) is among the world's  communications
leaders, providing voice, data, video and broadband  telecommunications services
to large and small  businesses,  consumers and government  agencies.  We provide
domestic  and  international  long  distance;   regional,   local  and  wireless
communications  services;  cable television and Internet communication services.
AT&T also provides billing,  directory and calling-card  services to support our
communications businesses.

MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC.

         We completed the merger with MediaOne  Group,  Inc.  (MediaOne) on June
15, 2000, in a cash and stock  transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
We issued  approximately  603 million shares,  of which 60 million were treasury
shares, and made cash payments of approximately $24 billion.

         The merger was recorded under the purchase  method of  accounting,  and
accordingly,  the  results of MediaOne  have been  included  with the  financial
results of AT&T,  within our Broadband  segment,  since the date of acquisition.
Periods  prior to the  merger  were not  restated  to  include  the  results  of
MediaOne.

TRACKING STOCKS

         On  April  27,  2000,  AT&T  issued a new  class of stock to track  the
performance  of AT&T  Wireless  Group.  AT&T  sold 360  million  shares  of AT&T
Wireless Group tracking  shares at a price of $29.50 per share.  The 360 million
shares track  approximately  16% of the financial  performance  of AT&T Wireless
Group.

         In   addition,   in   connection   with   the   1999   acquisition   of
Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), AT&T issued
a separate tracking stock to reflect the financial  performance of Liberty Media
Group (LMG), TCI's former programming and technology investment businesses.  The
outstanding  Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock tracks 100% of the  financial
performance of LMG.

         The remaining  results of operations of AT&T,  including  approximately
84% of the financial  performance of AT&T Wireless Group, are referred to as the
AT&T Common Stock Group and are represented by AT&T common stock.

         A  tracking  stock is  designed  to  provide  financial  returns to its
holders based on the financial  performance  and economic value of the assets it
tracks.  Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless Group tracking
stock or Liberty  Media Class A or B tracking  stock does not represent a direct
legal  interest  in the  assets and  liabilities  of any of the  groups,  but an
ownership  of AT&T in total.  The specific  shares  represent an interest in the
economic performance of the net assets of each of the groups.

         The   earnings   attributable   to  AT&T   Wireless   Group   represent
approximately  16% of the  earnings  from April 27, 2000,  through  December 31,
2000,  and are excluded from the earnings  available to AT&T Common Stock Group.
Similarly, the earnings and losses related to LMG are excluded from the earnings
available to AT&T Common Stock Group.
<PAGE>
         We do not have a  controlling  financial  interest in LMG for financial
accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  LMG  is  reflected  as an
investment  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  in  AT&T's  consolidated
financial  statements.  The amounts  attributable  to LMG are  reflected  in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as "Equity earnings (losses) from
Liberty  Media  Group"  and  "Investment  in  Liberty  Media  Group and  related
receivables, net".

         AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated business of AT&T and Liberty Media
Group is a combination  of certain  assets and  businesses  of AT&T,  neither of
which is a stand-alone  entity.  As AT&T Wireless  Group and Liberty Media Group
are tracking stocks of AT&T,  separate financial  statements are not required to
be filed. We have provided the financial statements as exhibits to this document
to  provide  additional  disclosures  to  investors  to allow them to assess the
financial  performance of AT&T Wireless Group and Liberty Media Group. Since the
tracking  stocks are governed by a common board of directors,  the AT&T board of
directors could make operational and financial  decisions or implement  policies
that affect  disproportionately  the businesses of any group.  For example,  our
board of  directors  may  decide  to  transfer  funds or to  reallocate  assets,
liabilities,  revenue, expenses and cash flows among groups, without the consent
of shareholders.  All actions by the board of directors are subject to the board
members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and not just to
holders  of a  particular  class of  tracking  stock and to our  charter, policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements.

         Our board of directors may change or supplement  the policies set forth
in the tracking stock policy  statements and our by-laws in the sole  discretion
of our  board  of  directors,  subject  to  the  provisions  of any  inter-group
agreement but without approval of our shareholders.  In addition,  the fact that
we have separate  classes of common stock could give rise to occasions  when the
interests of the holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless Group common stock
and Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
conflict.  Our board of  directors  would  make any  change or  addition  to the
policies set forth in the tracking stock policy  statements or our by-laws,  and
would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
in a  manner  consistent  with  its  fiduciary  duties  to  AT&T  and all of our
shareholders after giving  consideration to the potentially  divergent interests
and all other relevant  interests of the holders of the separate  classes of our
shares.

         You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our
board of  directors,  it may be  difficult  for  investors  to assess the future
prospects of a tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.

RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T

         On October 25, 2000,  we  announced a  restructuring  plan  designed to
fully  separate  or issue  separately  tracked  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial  performance  and economic  value of each of the company's  four major
operating  units.  Upon completion of the plan,  AT&T Wireless,  AT&T Broadband,
AT&T  Business and AT&T  Consumer  will all be  represented  by  asset-based  or
tracking stocks.

         As part of the first phase of the  restructuring  plan, we are planning
an exchange offer that will give AT&T  shareowners  the  opportunity to exchange
any  portion of their AT&T  common  shares  for  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking stock, subject to pro-ration.  Following the exchange offer and subject
to specified conditions,  AT&T plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T.
We intend,  however,  to retain up to $3 billion of shares of AT&T  Wireless for
future sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.
We expect AT&T Wireless  will become an  independent,  publicly-held  company in
mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals.

         In  addition  to the  split-off  of AT&T  Wireless,  we intend to fully
separate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial  performance
and economic value of each of our other major business  units. We plan to create
and issue new classes of stock to track the financial  performance  and economic
value of our AT&T  Broadband  unit and AT&T Consumer  unit. We plan to sell some
percentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband  unit in the fall of 2001.  Within 12
months of such sale, we intend to completely  separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,
as an  asset-based  stock.  The AT&T Consumer  tracking  stock is expected to be
fully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of 2001.

         AT&T  expects  that  these   transactions  will  be  tax-free  to  U.S.
shareholders.   AT&T's   restructuring   plan  is  complicated  and  involves  a
substantial  number  of steps  and  transactions,  including  obtaining  various
conditions,  such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. In addition, future
financial conditions,  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur
that make it  inadvisable  to proceed  with part or all of AT&T's  restructuring
plan. Any or all of the elements of AT&T's  restructuring  plan may not occur as
we currently  expect or in the timeframes that we currently  contemplate,  or at
all.  Alternative forms of restructuring,  including sales of interests in these
businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution  to shareowners in
the restructuring.

         On November 15, 2000, we announced that our board of directors voted to
split-off  LMG.  A new  asset-based  security  will be issued to  holders of LMG
tracking stock in exchange for their LMG tracking shares.  The split-off remains
subject to receipt  of a  favorable  tax  ruling  from the IRS.  We expect  this
split-off to be completed in mid-2001.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         This document may contain  forward-looking  statements  with respect to
AT&T's  restructuring plan,  financial  condition,  results of operations,  cash

<PAGE>

flows, dividends,  financing plans, business strategies,  operating efficiencies
or synergies,  budgets,  capital and other  expenditures,  network build out and
upgrade,  competitive positions,  availability of capital,  growth opportunities
for  existing  products,  benefits  from  new  technologies,   availability  and
deployment of new  technologies,  plans and objectives of management,  and other
matters.

         These forward-looking statements,  including, without limitation, those
relating to the future business prospects,  revenue, working capital, liquidity,
capital needs,  network build out,  interest costs and income,  are  necessarily
estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those suggested by the forward-looking  statements.  These  forward-looking
statements  should,  therefore,  be  considered  in light of  various  important
factors that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from estimates or
projections  contained  in the  forward-looking  statements  including,  without
limitation:

         o        the  risks  associated  with  the   implementation  of  AT&T's
                  restructuring  plan,  which  is  complicated  and  involves  a
                  substantial   number  of  different   transactions  each  with
                  separate  conditions,  any or all of which may not occur as we
                  currently  intend,  or which may not occur in the timeframe we
                  currently expect,

         o        the risks  associated with each of AT&T's main business units,
                  operating as independent  entities as opposed to as part of an
                  integrated telecommunications provider following completion of
                  AT&T's  restructuring  plan,  including the inability of these
                  groups to rely on the financial and  operational  resources of
                  the  combined  company  and these  groups  having  to  provide
                  services that were previously  provided by a different part of
                  the combined company,

         o        the impact of existing and new  competitors  in the markets in
                  which these groups  compete,  including  competitors  that may
                  offer less  expensive  products  and  services,  desirable  or
                  innovative  products,   technological  substitutes,   or  have
                  extensive resources or better financing.

         o        the impact of oversupply of capacity resulting  from excessive
                  deployment of network capacity,

         o        the ongoing global and domestic trend towards consolidation in
                  the  telecommunications  industry,  which  trend  may have the
                  effect of making the  competitors of these entities larger and
                  better  financed and afford these  competitors  with extensive
                  resources  and  greater  geographic  reach,  allowing  them to
                  compete more effectively,

         o        the  effects of vigorous  competition  in the markets in which
                  the  company  operates,  which may  decrease  prices  charged,
                  increase  churn and change  customer  mix,  profitability  and
                  average revenue per user,

         o        the ability to enter into agreements  to provide, and the cost
                  of  entering  new  markets   necessary to  provide, nationwide
                  services,
<PAGE>

         o        the  ability to establish a significant market presence in new
                  geographic  and service markets,

         o        the  availability and cost of capital and  the consequences of
                  increased leverage,

         o        the successful  execution of plans to dispose of non-strategic
                  assets as part of an overall  corporate deleveraging plan,

         o        the  potential  impact  of NTT  DoCoMo's  investment  in AT&T,
                  including  provisions  of the  agreements  that  restrict AT&T
                  Wireless  Group's future  operations,  and provisions that may
                  require AT&T to repurchase  DoCoMo's  interest in AT&T if AT&T
                  or AT&T Wireless Group fail to meet specified conditions,

         o        the  impact  of  any  unusual  items  resulting  from  ongoing
                  evaluations  of  the  business  strategies of the company,

         o        the requirements imposed on the company or latitude allowed to
                  competitors by the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) or
                  state regulatory  commissions under the Telecommunications Act
                  of 1996 or other applicable laws and regulations,

         o        the  risks  and  costs  associated  with  the  need to acquire
                  additional wireless  spectrum for current and future services,

         o        the   risks  associated   with    technological  requirements,
                  technology  substitution and changes   and other technological
                  developments,

         o        the  results of  litigation filed  or to be  filed against the
                  company,

         o        the  possibility  of one or more of the  markets  in which the
                  company  competes  being  impacted  by changes  in  political,
                  economic or other factors,  such as monetary policy, legal and
                  regulatory  changes or other external factors over which these
                  groups have no control, and

         o        the  risks  related  to AT&T's  investments  in LMG  and joint
                  ventures.

         The words "estimate,"  "project," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan"
and similar  expressions  are intended to identify  forward-looking  statements.

consolidated  results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000,  1999
and 1998, and financial condition as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The  comparison of 2000 results with 1999 was impacted by events,  such
as  acquisitions  and  dispositions  that occurred  during these two years.  For

<PAGE>

example,  in  2000 we  acquired  MediaOne  and  wireless  properties  in the San
Francisco Bay area, which were both included in our 2000 results for part of the
year,  but were not in 1999  results.  In 1999,  we acquired TCI, the IBM Global
Network  (now AT&T  Global  Network  Services,  or AGNS) and  Vanguard  Cellular
Systems,  Inc. (Vanguard).  These businesses were included in 2000 results for a
full  year,  but  only  a  part  of  1999  (since  their   respective  dates  of
acquisition).  Further, we disposed of certain  international  businesses during
1999 and 2000.  The  results of  businesses  sold in 1999 were  included in 1999
results for part of the year, and were not in 2000 results. Likewise, businesses
sold in 2000 were included in 1999 results for the full year and in 2000 results
for part of the year.

         Year-over-year  comparison was also impacted by the consolidation of At
Home   Corp.    (Excite@Home)    beginning    September   1,   2000,    due   to
corporate-governance  changes  which gave AT&T a controlling  interest.  At that
time and on December 31, 2000, we had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
74% voting interest in Excite@Home. Prior to September 1, 2000, we accounted for
our ownership in Excite@Home under the equity method of accounting,  which means
our investment was included in "Other  investments and related  advances" in the
1999  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet and any earnings or losses were included as a
component  of "Net losses from other  equity  investments"  in the  Consolidated
Statements of Income. The consolidation of Excite@Home resulted in the inclusion
of 100% of its results in each line item of AT&T's  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet
and Consolidated Income Statement. The approximate 77% we do not own is shown in
the  2000  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  within  "Minority  interest"  and  as a
component of  "Minority  interest  income  (expense)"  in the 2000  Consolidated
Statement of Income.

         On January 5, 2000, we launched Concert,  our global joint venture with
British  Telecommunications  plc (BT). AT&T contributed all of its international
gateway-to-gateway   assets  and  the  economic  value  of   approximately   270
multinational  customers specifically targeted for direct sales by Concert. As a
result,  2000  results do not include the revenue and expenses  associated  with
these  customers and  businesses,  while 1999 does, and 2000 results include our
proportionate  share of  Concert's  earnings in "Net  losses  from other  equity
investments."

         Effective  July 1,  2000,  the  FCC  eliminated  Primary  Interexchange
Carrier  Charges (PICC or per-line  charges) that AT&T pays for  residential and
single-line  business  customers.  The  elimination  of these  per-line  charges
resulted  in lower  access  expense  as well as lower  revenue,  since  AT&T has
historically billed its customers for these charges.

         The  comparison of 1999 results with 1998 was also impacted by the 1999
acquisitions  of TCI,  AGNS and  Vanguard,  since  1999  results  include  these
businesses  for part of the  year,  while  1998  does  not  include  them.  This
comparison  is  also  impacted  by  the  1999   dispositions  of   international
businesses,  which were included in 1999 results for part of the year,  but were
in 1998 results for the full year.

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         Total revenue  increased  5.4%, or $3.4 billion,  in 2000 compared with
the prior year. Approximately $2.1 billion of the increase was due to the impact
of acquisitions and the  consolidation  of Excite@Home,  offset by the impact of
Concert,  dispositions  and the  elimination of PICC. The remaining $1.3 billion
increase was primarily  driven by a growing demand for our wireless and data and
Internet protocol (IP) products,  and outsourcing services,  partially offset by
continued and  accelerating  declines in long distance voice revenue.  We expect
long  distance  revenue  to  continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  ongoing
competition and product substitution.

         Total revenue in 1999 increased $9.4 billion,  or 17.6%,  compared with
1998.  Nearly  three-quarters  of the increase was due to  acquisitions,  net of
dispositions.  The remaining increase was fueled by growth in wireless, business
data, business long distance voice and outsourcing revenue,  partially offset by
the continued decline of consumer long distance voice revenue.

         Revenue by  segment  is  discussed  in  greater  detail in the  segment
results section.

Costs of services and products........................................       $17,587      $14,594     $10,495
</TABLE>

         Costs of  services  and  products  include the costs of  operating  and
maintaining our networks, costs to support our outsourcing contracts,  fees paid
to other wireless carriers for the use of their networks (off-network  roaming),
programming and licensing costs for cable services,  costs of wireless  handsets
sold,  the provision for  uncollectible  receivables  and other  service-related
costs.

         These costs  increased  $3.0 billion,  or 20.5%,  in 2000 compared with
1999. Nearly $2.1 billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impact
of  consolidating  Excite@Home,  net of the impact of Concert and divestments of
international businesses.  The higher costs associated with our growing wireless
subscriber  base  and  wireless  network  as well as new  outsourcing  contracts
increased expenses by approximately  $1.5 billion.  The higher wireless expenses
primarily  related to higher costs of handsets  sold, due to a 53.5% increase in
gross subscriber  additions in 2000 compared with 1999.  Expenses also increased
due to higher  video-programming  costs  principally due to rate increases,  and
higher  costs  associated  with new  broadband  services of  approximately  $0.3
billion.  These increases were partially offset by approximately $0.9 billion of
costs  savings from  continued  cost control  initiatives  and a higher  pension
credit in 2000, primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base, resulting
from increased investment returns.

         Costs of services and products  rose $4.1  billion,  or 39.1%,  in 1999
compared with 1998,  primarily due to acquisitions,  net of dispositions,  which
accounted  for  approximately  $3.7  billion of the  increase.  The higher costs
associated with our growing wireless  subscriber base as well as new outsourcing
contracts increased expenses by approximately $1.5 billion. Partially offsetting
the 1999 increases were network  cost-control  initiatives of approximately $0.4
billion,  and approximately  $0.3 billion of lower expenses in Business Services
related  to  per-call   compensation   expense,   provision  for   uncollectible
receivables and gross receipts and property taxes.

Access and other connection...........................................       $13,518      $14,686     $15,328
</TABLE>

         Access and other connection  expenses  decreased 8.0%, to $13.5 billion
in 2000,  compared with $14.7 billion in 1999.  Included within access and other
connection  expenses  are costs  that we pay to  connect  domestic  calls on the
facilities of other service providers.  Mandated reductions in per-minute access
costs and decreased  per-line  charges  resulted in lower costs of approximately
$1.5  billion.  Also  contributing  to the decrease was more  efficient  network
usage.  These decreases were partially offset by  approximately  $0.7 billion of
higher  costs due to volume  increases,  and $0.5  billion as a result of higher
Universal  Service Fund  contributions.  Since most of these  charges are passed
through  to  the  customer,  the  per-minute  access-rate  and  per-line  charge
reductions and the increased Universal Service Fund contributions have generally
resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue.

         Costs paid to  telephone  companies  outside  of the  United  States to
connect  calls made to  countries  outside of the United  States  (international
settlements)  are also  included  within access and other  connection  expenses.
These  costs  decreased  approximately  $0.5  billion in 2000,  as result of the
commencement  of  operations  of  Concert.   Concert  now  incurs  most  of  our
international  settlements as well as earns most of our foreign-billed  revenue,
previously  incurred and earned  directly by AT&T. In 2000,  Concert billed us a
net expense composed of international settlement  (interconnection)  expense and
foreign-billed  revenue.  The  amount  charged by Concert in 2000 was lower than
interconnection expense incurred in 1999, since AT&T recorded these transactions
as revenue and expense,  as  applicable.  Partially  offsetting the decline were
costs incurred related to Concert products that AT&T now sells to its customers.

         Access and other connection expenses declined $0.6 billion, or 4.2%, in
1999  compared with the prior year.  This decline  resulted from $0.9 billion of
mandated  reductions  in  per-minute  access  rates in 1999 and  1998,  and $0.6
billion of lower international  settlement rates resulting from our negotiations
with  international  carriers.  Additionally,  we continue to manage these costs
through more efficient network usage.  These reductions were partially offset by
$0.8 billion of higher costs due to volume growth,  and $0.3 billion as a result
of increased per-line charges and Universal Service Fund contributions.

         Selling,  general and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  decreased $0.2
billion, or 1.6%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  Approximately $2.0 billion of the
decrease was due to savings from continued cost-control initiatives and a higher
pension credit in 2000,  primarily  driven by a higher pension trust asset base,
resulting from increased  investment  returns.  Largely offsetting this decrease
was more than  $1.4  billion  of higher  expenses  associated  with our  growing
wireless  and  broadband  businesses,   and  nearly  $0.7  billion  of  expenses
associated with  acquisitions and the  consolidation of Excite@Home,  net of the
impact of Concert and dispositions.
<PAGE>

         SG&A expenses  increased  $0.7 billion,  or 5.8%, in 1999 compared with
1998.  This  increase was primarily due to  acquisitions,  net of  dispositions,
which  resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses of  approximately  $1.4 billion.
Also contributing to the increase was approximately $0.4 billion of higher costs
to support our growing  wireless  subscriber  base.  Partially  offsetting these
increases  were our continued  efforts to control costs on a companywide  basis,
which resulted in lower SG&A expenses of approximately  $0.9 billion,  including
lower spending for consumer long distance acquisition-programs.

         Depreciation  and other  amortization  expenses rose $1.1  billion,  or
18.5%, in 2000 compared with 1999 and increased $1.8 billion,  or 40.2%, in 1999
compared with 1998. Approximately one-half of the increase in both years was due
to acquisitions and the  consolidation  of Excite@Home,  net of dispositions and
the impact of Concert,  as applicable.  The remaining increase was primarily due
to a higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment. Total
capital  expenditures for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $14.6 billion,  $13.5 billion
and $8.0  billion,  respectively.  We continue to focus the vast majority of our
capital spending on our growth  businesses of broadband,  wireless,  data and IP
and local.

         Amortization   of  goodwill,   franchise   costs  and  other  purchased
intangibles  increased $1.7 billion,  or 130.1%, in 2000 compared with the prior
year.  This  increase  was  largely   attributable  to  the   consolidation   of
Excite@Home,  as well as  acquisitions,  primarily  MediaOne and TCI.  Franchise
costs represent the value attributable to agreements with local authorities that
allow access to homes in Broadband's service areas. Other purchased  intangibles
arising from business combinations primarily included customer relationships and
licenses.

         Amortization   of  goodwill,   franchise   costs  and  other  purchased
intangibles  increased  $1.1 billion in 1999 compared with 1998 due primarily to
the acquisition of TCI and, to a lesser extent, AGNS.

         As a result of our evaluation of recent changes in our industry and the
views of regulatory  authorities,  AT&T expects that the amortization period for
all  licensing  costs,  franchise  costs,  and goodwill  associated  with  newly
acquired wireless,  telecommunications,  and cable operations will not exceed 25
years.

Net restructuring and other charges.......................................       $7,029     $1,506     $2,514
</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         During 2000,  we recorded $7.0 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.90 earnings per diluted share impact to the
AT&T  Common  Stock  Group.  The 2000  charge  included  $6.2  billion  of asset
impairment  charges related to Excite@Home,  $759 million for  restructuring and
exit costs  associated with AT&T's  initiative to reduce costs,  and $91 million
related to the  government-mandated  disposition of AT&T  Communications  (U.K.)
Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.

         The asset impairment  charges related to Excite@Home  resulted from the
deterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of Internet-related
companies  during  the fourth  quarter  of 2000,  which  caused  Excite@Home  to
conclude   that   intangible   assets   related   to   their   acquisitions   of
Internet-related  companies  may not be  recoverable.  Accordingly,  Excite@Home
conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
acquired  intangible  assets.  This assessment  resulted in a determination that
certain  acquired  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  related  to  these
acquisitions,  including  Excite,  were  impaired as of December 31, 2000.  As a
result,  Excite@Home  recorded  impairment  charges of $4.6  billion in December
2000, representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over
their fair value.

         The  impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparison
of carrying values and fair values. The impairment  write-down within each asset
group was allocated  first to goodwill,  and if goodwill was reduced to zero, to
identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.

         Since  we own  approximately  23%  of  Excite@Home,  77% of the  charge
recorded by  Excite@Home  was not  included as a reduction to AT&T's net income,
but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  Consolidated  Statement  of Income as
"Minority interest income (expense)."

         Also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  AT&T  recorded  a  goodwill  and
acquisition-related  impairment  charge  of $1.6  billion  associated  with  the
acquisition of our investment in  Excite@Home.  The write-down of our investment
to fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.

         The $759 million charge for  restructuring and exit plans was primarily
due to headcount reductions, mainly in network operations and Business Services,
including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
synergies created by the MediaOne merger.

         Included in exit costs was $503  million of cash  termination  benefits
associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of
voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  Approximately  one-half of the
separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
Approximately   6,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
terminations and approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.

         We also  recorded  $62  million  of  network  lease and other  contract
termination  costs  associated  with  penalties  incurred  as part of  notifying
vendors of the termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of
$32 million related to the disposition of facilities  primarily due to synergies
created by the MediaOne merger.

         Also included in restructuring  and exit costs in 2000 was $144 million
of benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part
of these exit plans.  Further,  we recorded  an asset  impairment  charge of $18
million related to the write-down of unrecoverable  assets in certain businesses
where the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.
<PAGE>

         The 2000 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
of  approximately  $690  million  per  year,  as well as EBIT  (earnings  before
interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax losses
from other equity  investments)  savings of approximately $700 million per year.
We expect increased spending in growth businesses will largely offset these cash
and  EBIT  savings.  The  EBIT  savings,   primarily   attributable  to  reduced
personnel-related  expenses,  will be  realized  in SG&A  expenses  and costs of
services and products.

         During 1999,  we recorded $1.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.37 earnings per diluted share impact to the
AT&T Common Stock Group.

         A $594 million in-process  research and development charge was recorded
reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI,
as of the  date of the  acquisition,  which  had not yet  reached  technological
feasibility or had no alternative future use. The projects identified related to
efforts to offer voice over IP, product-integration efforts for advanced set-top
devices,  cost-savings  efforts  for  broadband-telephony   implementation,  and
in-process  research and development  related to  Excite@Home.  We estimated the
fair value of  in-process  research and  development  for each project  using an
income  approach,  which  was  adjusted  to  allocate  fair  value  based on the
project's  percentage of completion.  Under this approach,  the present value of
the anticipated  future benefits of the projects was determined using a discount
rate of 17%. For each project, the resulting net present value was multiplied by
a percentage of  completion  based on effort  expended to date versus  projected
costs to complete.

         The charge associated with voice-over-IP technology, which allows voice
telephony  traffic to be digitized and transmitted in IP data packets,  was $225
million as of the date of acquisition.  Current voice-over-IP equipment does not
yet support many of the features required to connect customer premises equipment
to traditional phone networks.  Further technical  development is also needed to
ensure  voice  quality  that  is  comparable  to  conventional  circuit-switched
telephony and to reduce the power consumption of the IP-telephony  equipment. We
started  testing  IP-telephony  equipment  in the  field in  late-2000  and will
continue tests throughout 2001.

         The charge  associated  with  product-integration  efforts for advanced
set-top devices, which will enable us to offer next-generation digital services,
was $114 million as of the acquisition date. The associated  technology consists
of the development  and  integration  work needed to provide a suite of software
tools to run on the digital  set-top box hardware  platform.  It is  anticipated
that field trials will begin in late-2001 for next-generation digital services.

         The charge associated with cost-savings efforts for broadband-telephony
implementation  was $101 million as of the date of  acquisition.  Telephony cost
reductions  primarily consist of cost savings from the development of a "line of
power  switch," which allows us to cost  effectively  provide power for customer
telephony  equipment  through  the cable  plant.  This  device  will allow us to
provide  line-powered  telephony  without  burying the cable line to each house.
Trials related to our telephony cost reductions are complete, and implementation
has begun in certain markets.

         Additionally, the in-process research and development charge related to
Excite@Home was valued at $154 million. This charge related to projects to allow
for  self-provisioning of devices and the development of next-generation  client
software,  network and back-office infrastructure to enable a variety of network
devices  beyond  personal  computers  and improved  design for the regional data
centers' infrastructure.
<PAGE>

         Although  there are  technological  issues to overcome to  successfully
complete the acquired in-process research and development,  we expect successful
completion.  We estimate the costs to complete the identified  projects will not
have a material impact on our results of operations.  If, however, we are unable
to  establish   technological   feasibility  and  produce   commercially  viable
products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.

         A $531 million asset impairment  charge was recorded in 1999 associated
with the planned disposal of certain wireless communications equipment resulting
from a program to increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our wireless
network.  As part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
equipment in the western  United States and the  metropolitan  New York markets.
The program is intended to provide Wireless  Services with the newest technology
available  and allow us to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities. Since the assets will
remain in service  from the date of the  decision to dispose of these  assets to
the  disposal  date,  the  remaining  net  book  value  of the  assets  will  be
depreciated over this period.

         Also in 1999, a $145 million  charge for  restructuring  and exit costs
was recorded as part of AT&T's initiative to reduce costs. The restructuring and
exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
reductions  in  Business   Services  and  network   operations,   including  the
consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

         Included in exit costs was $142  million of cash  termination  benefits
associated  with the  separation  of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of
voluntary  and  involuntary  termination  plans.  Approximately  one-half of the
separations were management employees and one-half were nonmanagement employees.
Approximately   1,700   employee   separations   were  related  to   involuntary
terminations and approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.

         The 1999 restructuring  initiatives are projected to yield cash savings
of approximately $250 million per year. This restructuring  yielded EBIT savings
of  approximately  $200  million in 2000,  and is  expected  to save nearly $400
million per year thereafter.  We expect increased  spending in growth businesses
will largely  offset these cash and EBIT savings.  The EBIT  savings,  primarily
attributable  to reduced  personnel-related  expenses,  will be realized in SG&A
expenses and costs of services and products.

         We  also   recorded  net  losses  of  $307   million   related  to  the
government-mandated  disposition of certain international  businesses that would
have competed  directly with Concert,  and $50 million related to a contribution
agreement Broadband entered into with Phoenixstar,  Inc. That agreement requires
Broadband  to  satisfy   certain   liabilities   owed  by  Phoenixstar  and  its
subsidiaries.  The remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and an
agreement  that  MediaOne  had is $57  million,  which was fully  accrued for at
December 31, 2000. In addition,  we recorded benefits of $121 million related to
the settlement of pension  obligations for former  employees who accepted AT&T's
1998 voluntary retirement incentive program (VRIP) offer.

         During 1998,  we recorded $2.5 billion of net  restructuring  and other
charges, which had an approximate $0.59 earnings per diluted share impact to the
AT&T Common Stock Group.  The bulk of the charge was associated with our overall
cost-reduction  program and the approximately  15,300  management  employees who
accepted the VRIP offer. A  restructuring  charge of $2,724 million was composed

<PAGE>

of  $2,254   million  and  $169   million   for   pension   and   postretirement
special-termination  benefits,   respectively,  $263  million  of  benefit  plan
curtailment  losses  and $38  million  of other  administrative  costs.  We also
recorded charges of $125 million for related facility costs and $150 million for
executive-separation  costs.  These charges were partially offset by benefits of
$940 million as we settled pension  benefit  obligations for 13,700 of the total
VRIP  employees.  In addition,  the VRIP charges  were  partially  offset by the
reversal  of $256  million of 1995  business  restructuring  reserves  primarily
resulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain 1995 projects.

         Also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718  million,  of which $633  million was
related  to  our  decision  not  to  pursue  Total  Service  Resale  (TSR)  as a
local-service  strategy. We also recorded an $85 million asset impairment charge
related to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  international
operations  where the  carrying  value was no longer  supported  by future  cash
flows. This charge was made in connection with the review of certain  operations
that would have competed directly with Concert.

         Additionally,  $85 million of merger-related  expenses were recorded in
1998 in connection  with the Teleport  Communications  Group Inc.  (TCG) merger,
which was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Partially  offsetting  these
charges  was a $92  million  reversal of the 1995  restructuring  reserve.  This
reversal reflected  reserves no longer deemed necessary.  The reversal primarily
included  separation costs attributed to projects completed at a cost lower than
originally   anticipated.   Consistent  with  the  three-year   plan,  the  1995
restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 1998.

Operating income.........................................................       $4,277     $10,859     $7,487
</TABLE>

         Operating  income  decreased $6.6 billion,  or 60.6%,  in 2000 compared
with 1999. The decrease was primarily due to higher net  restructuring and other
charges of $5.5 billion. Also contributing to the decrease was the impact of the
acquisition  of MediaOne and the  consolidation  of  Excite@Home,  which lowered
operating  income by $1.5 billion.  A majority of the impact of operating losses
and the  restructuring  charge  generated by Excite@Home  was offset in minority
interest income  (expense),  reflecting the approximate 77% of Excite@Home we do
not own. Partially offsetting these decreases were cost-control  initiatives and
a larger pension credit associated with our mature long distance  businesses and
related support groups, partially offset by lower long distance revenue.

         Operating  income rose $3.4  billion,  or 45.0%,  in 1999 compared with
1998. The increase was driven by approximately  $2.3 billion of operating income
improvements in Business Services and Consumer  Services,  reflecting  operating
expense  efficiencies.  Also  contributing  to the  increase was $1.0 billion of
lower net restructuring and other charges.

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         Other income  increased $0.6 billion,  or 62.4%,  in 2000 compared with
1999.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to  greater  net  gains  on  sales of
businesses  and   investments  of   approximately   $1.0  billion,   and  higher
investment-related  income of  approximately  $0.3 billion.  The higher gains on
sales  were  driven  by  significant  gains  associated  with  the swap of cable
properties  with Comcast  Corporation  (Comcast)  and Cox  Communications,  Inc.
(Cox), the sale of our investment in Lenfest Communications,  Inc. (Lenfest) and
Celumovil,  and a gain  recorded as a result of the merger of TeleCorp PCS, Inc.
(TeleCorp)  and Tritel,  Inc.  (Tritel)  and related  transactions.  These gains
aggregated  approximately $1.0 billion and had an approximate $0.29 earnings per
diluted  share  impact to the AT&T  Common  Stock  Group.  In 1999,  we recorded
significant  gains  associated  with  the  sale of our  Language  Line  Services
business,  a portion of our  ownership  interest  in AT&T  Canada as well as our
investment in Wood-TV. These gains aggregated approximately $0.4 billion and had
an approximate  $0.07 earnings per diluted share impact to the AT&T Common Stock
Group.  Offsetting the increases to other income in 2000 was an approximate $0.5
billion charge  reflecting the increase in the fair value of put options held by
Comcast and Cox related to Excite@Home  stock, and approximately $0.2 billion of
higher investment impairment charges.

         Other income  decreased $0.4 billion,  or 27.3%,  in 1999 compared with
1998.  The  decrease  was due to lower  net  gains on  sales of  businesses  and
investments of  approximately  $0.3 billion as well as lower  investment-related
income of approximately  $0.2 billion.  In 1999, we recorded  significant  gains
associated  with the sale of our Language Line Services  business,  a portion of
our  ownership  interest  in AT&T Canada as well as our  investment  in Wood-TV.
These gains aggregated  approximately  $0.4 billion and had an approximate $0.07
earnings per diluted  share impact to the AT&T Common Stock Group.  In 1998,  we
recorded  significant gains associated with the sale of AT&T Solutions  Customer
Care, LIN Television  Corp. and SmarTone  Telecommunications  Holdings  Limited.
These gains aggregated  approximately  $0.8 billion and had an approximate $0.18
earnings per diluted share impact to the AT&T Common Stock Group.

         Interest  expense  increased  80.3%, or $1.4 billion,  in 2000 compared
with 1999.  The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance as a
result of our June 2000 acquisition of MediaOne,  including  outstanding debt of
MediaOne  and debt issued to fund the MediaOne  acquisition,  and our March 1999
acquisition of TCI, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.

         Interest expense increased $1.3 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, due
to a higher average debt balance  associated  with our  acquisitions,  including
debt outstanding of TCI at the date of acquisition.

Provision for income taxes................................................       $3,342     $3,695     $3,049
</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         The  effective  income tax rate is the  provision for income taxes as a
percent of income from continuing  operations before income taxes. The effective
income  tax rate was 128.1% in 2000,  36.9% in 1999 and 36.6% in 1998.  In 2000,
the effective tax rate was negatively  impacted by Excite@Home,  which is unable
to record tax benefits  associated  with its pretax  losses.  Therefore the $4.6
billion restructuring charges taken by Excite@Home in 2000 had no associated tax
benefit.  The 2000 effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax-free gain
resulting  from an exchange  of AT&T stock for an entity  owning  certain  cable
systems  and other  assets  with Cox and the  benefit  of the  write-off  of the
related  deferred tax  liability.  The 1999  effective  tax rate was  negatively
impacted by a non-tax-deductible research and development charge, but positively
impacted  by a change in the net  operating  loss  utilization  tax  rules  that
resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance and the income tax provision.

         Minority  interest  income  (expense),  which is recorded net of income
taxes,  represents  an adjustment to AT&T's income to reflect the less than 100%
ownership of  consolidated  subsidiaries as well as dividends on preferred stock
issued by subsidiaries of AT&T. The $4.2 billion  increase in minority  interest
in 2000 resulted from the  consolidation of Excite@Home  effective  September 1,
2000. The minority  interest income in 2000 primarily  reflects losses generated
by Excite@Home, including the goodwill impairment charge, that were attributable
to the  approximate  77% of  Excite@Home  not  owned by AT&T.  The  decrease  in
minority  interest in 1999  compared with 1998 was primarily due to dividends on
preferred securities issued by a subsidiary trust of AT&T in 1999.

         Equity earnings from LMG, which are recorded net of income taxes,  were
$1.5 billion in 2000, compared with losses of $2.0 billion in 1999. The increase
was primarily due to gains on dispositions,  including gains associated with the
mergers of various  companies that LMG had  investments  in. Gains were recorded
for the difference  between the carrying value of LMG's interest in the acquired
company and the fair value of  securities  received in the merger.  In addition,
lower stock  compensation  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 contributed to the
increase.  These were partially  offset by impairment  charges recorded on LMG's
investments to reflect other than temporary  declines in value and higher losses
relating to LMG's equity affiliates.

<PAGE>

         Net losses from other  equity  investments,  which are  recorded net of
income taxes, were $0.2 billion in 2000, a 73.2% improvement compared with 1999.
This  improvement  was primarily a result of the redemption of our investment in
AB Cellular which resulted in the distribution of wireless properties in the Los
Angeles  area  to  AT&T,  which  caused  AB  Cellular  to  record  a gain on the
distribution. Our pro rata share of this gain was approximately $0.4 billion. In
addition,  in 2000,  earnings from our investment in  Cablevision  Systems Corp.
(Cablevision) were approximately $0.2 billion higher than 1999 due to gains from
cable-system  sales.  Offsetting  these  increases were losses from our stake in
Time Warner  Entertainment  Company,  L.P. (TWE) which we acquired in connection
with the  MediaOne  merger and greater  equity  losses from  Excite@Home,  which
aggregated approximately $0.1 billion.

         Net losses from equity  investments  were $0.8 billion in 1999 compared
with $78 million in 1998,  primarily due to losses we recorded on investments we
acquired through TCI, largely Cablevision and Excite@Home.

         Earnings per diluted share (EPS)  attributable to the AT&T Common Stock
Group were $0.88 in 2000 compared  with $1.74 in 1999, a decrease of 49.4%.  The
decrease was primarily due to higher  restructuring and asset impairment charges
and the MediaOne acquisition,  including the impact of shares issued,  operating
losses of MediaOne and additional  interest  expense.  Also  contributing to the
decrease was the impact of Excite@Home,  including the mark-to-market adjustment
related to the put options held by Comcast and Cox. These were partially  offset
by lower  losses  from  equity  investments  and an  increase  in other  income,
primarily   associated  with  higher  net  gains  on  sales  of  businesses  and
investments, and higher investment-related income. Also impacting EPS was higher
operating income associated with our mature long distance businesses.

         EPS from  continuing  operations  attributable to the AT&T Common Stock
Group on a diluted basis declined  10.3% in 1999, to $1.74,  compared with 1998.
The decline was  primarily  due to the impact of the TCI and AGNS  acquisitions,
including  the  impact of shares  issued and equity  losses of  Excite@Home  and
Cablevision.  Partially offsetting these declines were increased income from the
remaining  operations due to revenue growth and operating expense  efficiencies,
as well as lower net restructuring and other charges.
<PAGE>

         EPS for Liberty Media Group was $0.58 in 2000,  compared with a loss of
$0.80 per share for 1999.  The  increase  in EPS was  primarily  due to gains on
dispositions,  including gains associated with the mergers of various  companies
that LMG had investments in. Gains were recorded for the difference  between the
carrying value of LMG's  interest in the acquired  company and the fair value of
securities received in the merger. In addition, lower stock compensation expense
in 2000 compared with 1999  contributed  to the increase.  These were  partially
offset by impairment charges recorded on LMG's investments to reflect other than
temporary  declines  in  value  and  higher  losses  relating  to  LMG's  equity
affiliates.

Discontinued Operations

         Pursuant to Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the
Results  of  Operations--Reporting  the  Effects of  Disposal  of a Segment of a
Business,  and  Extraordinary,  Unusual and  Infrequently  Occurring  Events and
Transactions,"  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  AT&T  reflect  the
disposition of AT&T Universal  Card Services  (UCS),  which was sold on April 2,
1998, as discontinued operations.  Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses,
and cash flows of UCS have been  excluded  from the  respective  captions in the
1998 Consolidated  Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
and have been reported  through the April 2, 1998 date of disposition as "Income
from discontinued  operations," net of applicable income taxes; and as "Net cash
provided by discontinued  operations."  The gain associated with the sale of UCS
is  recorded as "Gain on sale of  discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable
income taxes.

Extraordinary Items

         In August 1998, AT&T extinguished  approximately  $1.0 billion of TCG's
debt.  The $217  million  pretax  loss on the early  extinguishment  of debt was
recorded as an  extraordinary  loss. The after-tax  impact was $137 million,  or
$0.05 per diluted share.

SEGMENT RESULTS

         In support of the services we provided in 2000,  we segment our results
by the  business  units that  support our primary  lines of  business:  Business
Services,  Consumer  Services,  Wireless Services and Broadband.  The balance of
AT&T's operations, excluding LMG, is included in a Corporate and Other category.
Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.

         The  discussion of segment  results  includes  revenue;  EBIT (earnings
before interest and taxes,  including  pretax  minority  interest and net pretax
losses  of  other  equity   investments);   EBITDA   (EBIT  plus   depreciation,
amortization  and minority  interest income  (expense) other than  Excite@Home);
total  assets,  and capital  additions.  The  discussion  of EBITDA for Wireless
Services and  Broadband is modified to exclude  other income and net losses from
equity investments.  Total assets for each segment generally include all assets,
except intercompany receivables. However, our Wireless Services segment included
intercompany  receivables  from AT&T and the related interest income since these
assets  relate to the  results  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracked  business.
Prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
held at the  corporate  level,  and  therefore are included in the Corporate and
Other group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocated
each January, based on two years of volumes.  Capital additions for each segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,  acquisitions of
licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
and additions to internal-use software.
<PAGE>

         EBIT is the primary  measure  used by AT&T's chief  operating  decision
makers to measure AT&T's operating results and to measure segment  profitability
and performance. AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus net pretax losses
from equity  investments,  pretax minority  interest income  (expense) and other
income.  In  addition,  management  also uses  EBITDA as a  measure  of  segment
profitability  and  performance,  and is  defined  as EBIT,  excluding  minority
interest  income  (expense)  other  than  Excite@Home,   plus  depreciation  and
amortization. Interest and taxes are not factored into the segment profitability
measure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for these
items  are  discussed  on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes  EBIT is
meaningful to investors  because it provides analysis of operating results using
the same measures used by AT&T's chief operating  decision makers and provides a
return on total  capitalization  measure.  We believe  EBITDA is  meaningful  to
investors as a measure of each segment's  liquidity  consistent with the measure
utilized by our chief operating  decision makers.  In addition,  we believe that
both EBIT and EBITDA allow  investors a means to evaluate the financial  results
of each segment in relation to total AT&T. EBIT for AT&T was $9.4 billion, $10.5
billion and $8.7 billion for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively. EBITDA for AT&T was $19.8 billion, $18.6 billion and $13.4 billion
for the  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Our
calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation
of these  measures  by other  public  companies.  EBIT and EBITDA  should not be
viewed  by  investors  as  an  alternative  to  generally  accepted   accounting
principles  (GAAP)  measures  of income as a measure of  performance  or to cash
flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
liquidity.  In addition,  EBITDA does not take into  account  changes in certain
assets and liabilities as well as interest and taxes which can affect cash flow.

         Reflecting  the dynamics of our  business,  we  continually  review our
management model and structure and make adjustments accordingly.

BUSINESS SERVICES

         Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications
services,  including long distance,  local,  and data and IP networking to small
and medium-sized  businesses,  large domestic and  multinational  businesses and
government agencies.  Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and IP
transport to service resellers (wholesale services).

         Business    Services    includes   AT&T   Solutions,    the   company's
professional-services  outsourcing  business,  which provides seamless solutions
that  maximize  the  competitive   advantage  of   networking-based   electronic
applications for global clients.  AT&T Solutions also provides  e-infrastructure
and high-availability services to enterprise clients, and manages AT&T's unified
global network.

REVENUE

         In 2000, Business Services revenue grew $1.0 billion, or 3.7%, compared
with 1999.  Approximately  $0.4 billion of the increase was due to the impact of
acquisitions, partially offset by the formation of Concert. Strength in data and
IP  services  as well as growth in our  outsourcing  business  contributed  $1.8
billion to the increase. This growth, however, was offset by an approximate $0.9
billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricing
pressures in the industry.

         Revenue in 1999 grew $3.2 billion,  or 13.2%.  The  acquisition of AGNS
contributed  approximately $1.1 billion to the growth.  Data, IP and outsourcing
services grew  approximately $1.5 billion in 1999 compared with 1998, while long
distance  voice  services  and local  services  contributed  approximately  $0.6
billion to the revenue increase.

         Data services,  which represent the transportation of data, rather than
voice,  along our network,  was impacted by  acquisitions  and the  formation of
Concert.  Excluding these impacts, data services grew at a high-teens percentage
rate in 2000. Growth was led by the continued  strength of frame relay services;
IP services,  which include IP-connectivity services and virtual private network
(VPN) services; and high-speed  private-line  services.  Excluding the impact of
AGNS,  data  services  grew at a  high-teens  percentage  rate in  1999,  led by
strength in frame relay and high-speed private-line services.

         AT&T  Solutions  outsourcing  revenue  grew 47.9% in 2000 and 146.0% in
1999.  More than one-half of the 2000 growth and  approximately  65% of the 1999
growth was driven by our acquisition of AGNS. The remaining growth in both years
was primarily due to growth from new contract  signings and add-on business from
existing clients.

         Excluding the impact of Concert,  long distance voice services  revenue
declined  at a mid  single-digit  percentage  rate  in 2000  due to a  declining
average price per minute  reflecting the competitive  forces within the industry
which are expected to  continue.  Partially  offsetting  this decline was a high
single-digit  percentage  growth rate in minutes.  In 1999,  long distance voice
revenue  grew  at a low  single-digit  percentage  rate,  as  volumes  grew at a
high-teens percentage rate, which was largely offset by a declining average rate
per minute.

         Local voice services  revenue grew nearly 20% in 2000 and more than 50%
in 1999.  During 2000, AT&T added more than 867,000 access lines, with the total
reaching nearly 2.3 million at the end of the year. During 1999, AT&T added more
than 719,000 access lines.  Access lines enable AT&T to provide local service to
customers by allowing  direct  connection  from  customer  equipment to the AT&T
network.  AT&T serves more than 6,000 buildings on-network (buildings where AT&T
owns the  fiber  that runs  into the  building),  representing  an  increase  of
approximately  3.5% over 1999.  At the end of 1999,  AT&T served just over 5,800
buildings  on-network  compared with approximately 5,200 buildings at the end of
1998.

         Business Services  internal revenue increased $66 million,  or 9.1%, in
2000 and $253 million, or 52.8%, in 1999. The increase in 2000 was the result of
greater sales of business long distance services to other AT&T units that resell
such  services to their  external  customers,  primarily  Broadband and Wireless
Services.  The  increase  in 2000 was  partially  offset by a  decline  in sales
related to international  businesses divested. In 1999, the increase in internal
revenue was primarily due to greater sales of long distance services to Wireless
Services.
<PAGE>

EBIT/EBITDA

         EBIT improved $0.4 billion,  or 6.7%, and EBITDA improved $0.8 billion,
or 8.1%, in 2000 compared with 1999.  This  improvement  reflects an increase in
revenue  and lower  costs as a result  of our  continued  cost-control  efforts,
partially  offset by the  formation  of  Concert  and the  acquisition  of AGNS.
Additionally,  the  EBIT  increase  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in
depreciation and  amortization  expense in 2000 compared with 1999 primarily due
to a higher network asset base.

         In 1999, EBIT improved $1.1 billion, or 22.9%, and EBITDA improved $1.9
billion,  or 25.7%,  compared with 1998.  These increases were driven by revenue
growth  combined with margin  improvement  resulting  from ongoing  cost-control
initiatives.  The increase in EBIT was offset somewhat by increased depreciation
and amortization expenses resulting from increased capital expenditures aimed at
data, IP and local services.

OTHER ITEMS

         Capital  additions  decreased  $1.3 billion in 2000, and increased $1.4
billion in 1999.  In 2000,  the decrease was a result of lower  spending for our
long distance  network  (including the data network).  In 1999, the increase was
primarily  due to  additional  spending for the build out of our local  services
SONET transport network.

         Total assets  increased  $2.8  billion,  or 8.7%, at December 31, 2000,
compared with December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to net increases
in property,  plant and equipment as a result of capital additions, and a higher
accounts receivable balance.

CONSUMER SERVICES

         Our Consumer  Services  segment provides  residential  customers with a
variety of any-distance communications services,  including long distance, local
toll (intrastate calls outside the immediate local area) and Internet access. In
addition,  Consumer  Services  provides  transaction  services,  such as prepaid
calling card and operator-handled  calling services. Local phone service is also
provided in certain areas.

REVENUE

         Consumer  Services  revenue  declined 13.2%,  or $2.9 billion,  in 2000
compared  with 1999.  Approximately  $0.9  billion of the decline was due to the
elimination of per-line charges in 2000 and the impact of Concert. The remainder
of the decline was primarily  due to a decline in  traditional  voice  services,
such as  Domestic  Dial 1,  reflecting  the  ongoing  competitive  nature of the
consumer long distance  industry,  which has resulted in pricing pressures and a
loss of market share. Also negatively impacting revenue was product substitution
and  market   migration  away  from  direct-dial   wireline  and   higher-priced
calling-card  services to the rapidly growing wireless services and lower-priced
prepaid-card   services.  As  a  result,  calling  volumes  declined  at  a  mid
single-digit  percentage  rate  in  2000.  We  expect  competition  and  product
substitution to continue to negatively impact Consumer Services revenue.

         In August 1999, we introduced AT&T One Rate,  which allows customers to
make long distance  calls, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the same rate.
These One Rate offers  continue to be well received in the market with more than
12 million customers enrolled since the plan's introduction.  In addition,  AT&T
has been  successful  in  packaging  services in the  consumer  market by giving
customers  the option of intraLATA  service with its One Rate offers.  More than
60% of the  customers  enrolled in One Rate have chosen AT&T as their  intraLATA
provider.

         AT&T's any distance New York Local One Rate offer,  which combines both
local and long distance service, has experienced high customer acceptance.  AT&T
ended the year with nearly 760,000 customers under this plan.

         In 1999,  Consumer Services revenue decreased $1.0 billion, or 4.5%, on
a mid single-digit  percentage decline in volumes. The 1999 decline reflects the
ongoing  competitive nature of the consumer long distance  industry,  as well as
product   substitution   and  market   migration   away  from  direct  dial  and
higher-priced  calling-card  services to rapidly growing  wireless  services and
lower-priced prepaid-card services.

EBIT/EBITDA

         EBIT declined $0.8 billion, or 10.4%, and EBITDA declined $1.0 billion,
or 12.0%, in 2000 compared with 1999. The declines in EBIT and EBITDA  primarily
reflect  the  decline  in  the  long  distance  business,   offset  somewhat  by
cost-control  initiatives.  In addition,  the  declines  reflect $0.2 billion of
lower gains on sales of  businesses,  primarily  the 1999 sale of Language  Line
Services,  and  higher  restructuring   charges.   Reflecting  our  cost-control
initiatives,  EBIT and  EBITDA  margins  in 2000  improved  to 37.4% and  40.3%,
respectively, compared with 36.2% and 39.8%, respectively, in 1999.

         EBIT grew $1.3  billion,  or 20.4%,  and EBITDA grew $1.4  billion,  or
19.7%, in 1999. The EBIT margin improved to 36.2% in 1999 (excluding the gain on
the sale of Language Line  Services,  the 1999 EBIT margin was 35.5%) from 28.7%
in the  prior  year.  The EBIT and  EBITDA  growth  for  1999  reflects  ongoing
cost-reduction  efforts,  particularly in marketing  spending,  as well as lower
negotiated international settlement rates.

OTHER ITEMS

         Capital additions decreased $0.4 billion, or 54.0%, in 2000 as a result
of a planned  reduction in spending on the voice network and reduced spending on
internal-use  software as most of the  functionality  upgrades were completed in

<PAGE>

1999. In 1999, capital additions increased $0.2 billion, or 42.9%, primarily due
to increased spending on internal-use  software to add more functionality to our
services and in support of AT&T WorldNet Services subscriber growth.

         Total assets declined $1.5 billion,  or 23.5%, during 2000. The decline
was primarily due to assets transferred to Concert during 2000, as well as lower
accounts receivable, reflecting lower revenue.

WIRELESS SERVICES

         Our Wireless  Services  segment offers wireless voice and data services
and products to customers in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and 1900  megahertz
(Personal  Communications  Services,  or PCS)  markets.  Wireless  Services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the  United  States  and  internationally,  aviation-communications
services and the results of our messaging business through the

*    EBITDA for Wireless  Services  excludes net earnings  (losses)  from equity
     investments and other income.

REVENUE

         Wireless  Services  revenue grew $2.8 billion,  or 37.0%,  in 2000, and
$2.2 billion,  or 41.1%, in 1999.  Approximately $0.6 billion of the 2000 growth
was due to acquisitions,  and approximately  $0.2 billion of the 1999 growth was
due to the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions.  The remaining increases
were due to subscriber growth,  reflecting the continued successful execution of
AT&T's wireless strategy of targeting and retaining  specific customer segments,
expanding the national  wireless  footprint,  focusing on digital  service,  and
offering simple rate plans. In addition,  an increase in average monthly revenue
per user (ARPU) contributed to the growth.

         Consolidated  subscribers grew 58.5% during 2000 to approximately  15.2
million,  and grew  33.4% to  approximately  9.6  million in 1999.  This  growth
included  approximately 3.0 million  subscribers from acquisitions closed during

<PAGE>

2000, and approximately  900,000 from acquisitions  closed during 1999. ARPU was
$68.20 for 2000, a 3.6% increase  compared with 1999. ARPU in 1999 was $65.80, a
14.2% increase from 1998. The average monthly  subscriber churn rate in 2000 was
2.9% compared with 2.6% in 1999.  Average  monthly  subscriber  churn  increased
during  2000 as a result of  competitive  pressures,  as well as our  efforts to
expand to a broader base of consumer  segments  served (e.g.,  prepaid  wireless
services).  We expect these factors to continue,  which will result in a decline
in ARPU.

EBIT/EBITDA

         In 2000,  EBIT  improved $1.6 billion from a deficit of $0.5 billion in
1999.  Approximately  one-half  of the  improvement  was  due to  higher  pretax
earnings on equity  investments  and greater  gains on sales of  businesses  and
investments.  These items included higher equity earnings due to a gain recorded
relating to the redemption of our  investment in AB Cellular,  as well as a gain
on  transactions  associated  with our  affiliate  investments  in TeleCorp  and
Tritel, and a gain on the sale of Celumovil in 2000. In 1999, we recorded a gain
on the sale of WOOD-TV.  Also positively impacting the EBIT growth in 2000 was a
1999 asset impairment  charge of $0.5 billion and higher  intercompany  interest
income in 2000  resulting  from the AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock offering
proceeds  attributed  to Wireless  Services.  The  remaining  EBIT  increase was
primarily due to increased  revenue,  partially  offset by a related increase in
expenses.

         In 1999, EBIT declined $0.9 billion from $0.4 billion in 1998. The EBIT
decline was primarily due to the 1999 asset  impairment  charge of approximately
$0.5  billion  and  lower  gains on  sales  of  businesses  and  investments  of
approximately $0.5 billion.

         EBITDA,  which excludes net earnings  (losses) from equity  investments
and other income, increased $1.1 billion in 2000 to $1.7 billion.  Approximately
one-half of the increase was due to the 1999 impairment charge and the remainder
was  due to  increased  revenue,  partially  offset  by a  related  increase  in
expenses.

         In 1999,  EBITDA,  which  excludes  net earnings  (losses)  from equity
investments and other income, declined $0.3 billion to $0.6 billion. The decline
was primarily due to the 1999 asset  impairment  charge,  partially offset by an
increase in revenue net of related expenses.

OTHER ITEMS

         Capital  additions  increased  $2.8 billion in 2000, and increased $0.3
billion in 1999.  Spending in both years focused on increasing  the capacity and
quality of our national wireless network.

         Total assets were $35.2 billion as of December 31, 2000, an increase of
$11.8  billion,  or 50.3%,  compared  with  December 31, 1999.  The increase was
primarily due to increases in licensing costs, goodwill, and property, plant and
equipment  associated  with the  acquisitions  that closed in 2000. In addition,
property,  plant and  equipment  increased  as a result of  significant  capital
expenditures  in 2000.  These  increases were partially  offset by a decrease in
investments,  as Wireless Services  previously held equity interests in portions
of wireless  properties in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles through AB
Cellular. These markets were consolidated as of December 31, 2000.

*    EBITDA for Broadband  excludes net losses from equity investments and other
     income.

         Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, include the
results of MediaOne since its acquisition on June 15, 2000, while the year ended
December 31, 1999, does not include any results of MediaOne.  Additionally,  the
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999, include 10 months of
TCI's results,  reflecting its acquisition in March 1999,  while 2000 includes a
full 12 months of TCI's results.

REVENUE

         Broadband  revenue grew $3.1 billion in 2000,  or 62.1%,  compared with
1999.  Approximately  $2.8  billion of the  increase  in revenue  was due to the
acquisition  of MediaOne in 2000 and TCI in 1999. In addition,  revenue from new
services  (digital  video,  high-speed  data,  and  broadband  telephony)  and a
basic-cable rate increase contributed  approximately $0.4 billion to the revenue
increase.

         At December 31, 2000,  Broadband  serviced  approximately  16.0 million
basic-cable  customers,  passing approximately 28.3 million homes, compared with
11.4 million basic-cable customers,  passing approximately 19.7 million homes at
December  31, 1999.  The  increase  reflects  the  acquisition  of MediaOne.  At
December  31, 2000,  we provided  digital  video  service to  approximately  2.8
million  customers,   high-speed  data  service  to  approximately  1.1  million
customers,  and broadband telephony service to approximately  547,000 customers.
This  compares  with   approximately   1.8  million   digital-video   customers,
approximately  207,000  high-speed  data  customers,  and nearly 8,300 broadband
telephony customers at the end of 1999.

EBIT/EBITDA

         EBIT in 2000 was a deficit  of $1.2  billion,  an  improvement  of $0.3
billion,  or 20.4%.  This improvement was due to  approximately  $0.5 billion of
higher gains on sales of businesses and investments, primarily gains on the swap

<PAGE>

of cable  properties  with Cox and  Comcast  and the sale of our  investment  in
Lenfest, and $0.4 billion lower restructuring  charges primarily associated with
an in-process  research and  development  charge recorded in connection with the
1999 acquisition of TCI. Also  contributing to the improvement were lower pretax
losses from equity  investments  of $0.5 billion,  due in part to a $0.3 billion
improvement  from our investment in Cablevision  due to gains from  cable-system
sales.  These  improvements were largely offset by the impact of the acquisition
of MediaOne as well as TCI of  approximately  $0.5  billion and higher  expenses
associated   with   high-speed   data  and  broadband   telephony   services  of
approximately $0.4 billion.

         EBITDA,  which  excludes net losses from equity  investments  and other
income,  was $1.7 billion in 2000, an improvement of $0.9 billion  compared with
1999.  This  improvement  was  due  to  the  impact  of  the  MediaOne  and  TCI
acquisitions  of $0.7 billion and lower  restructuring  charges of $0.4 billion.
Higher  expenses  associated  with  high-speed  data and broadband  telephony of
approximately $0.2 billion offset these increases.

OTHER ITEMS

         Capital additions increased 4.3% to approximately $5.0 billion in 2000,
from $4.8 billion in 1999. The increase was due to higher  capital  expenditures
of $0.8 billion  primarily due to MediaOne,  which was almost entirely offset by
decreased contributions to various nonconsolidated  investments of $0.7 billion.
In 1999,  spending  was  largely  directed  toward  cable-distribution  systems,
focusing on the upgrade of cable plant-assets,  as well as equity infusions into
various investments.

         Total assets at December 31, 2000,  were $114.7  billion  compared with
$53.8  billion at December 31, 1999.  The increase in total assets was primarily
due to the MediaOne acquisition and an increase in property, plant and equipment
as a  result  of  capital  expenditures,  net  of  depreciation  expense.  These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in the mark-to-market valuation of
certain investments.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

         This group  reflects  the results of  corporate  staff  functions,  the
elimination  of  transactions  between  segments,  as  well  as the  results  of
international operations and ventures and Excite@Home.

<PAGE>

REVENUE

         Revenue for corporate and other  primarily  includes the elimination of
intercompany  revenue of negative $0.8 billion (an increase of $0.1 billion from
1999),  revenue  from  Excite@Home  of  $0.2  billion  (which  was  consolidated
beginning on September 1, 2000), and revenue from our  international  operations
and  ventures  of $0.3  billion (a  decline  of $0.9  billion  from  1999).  The
international  operations and ventures  revenue  decrease was largely due to the
revenue impact of businesses contributed to Concert and due to the impact of the
divestment of certain businesses.

         For 1999,  revenue  decreased $0.1 billion,  or 12.0%.  The decline was
driven by an increase in the elimination of intercompany revenue and the sale of
AT&T  Solutions  Customer  Care  (ASCC) in 1998,  partially  offset by growth in
international operations and ventures.

EBIT/EBITDA

         EBIT and  EBITDA  deficits  in 2000  increased  $2.5  billion  and $2.3
billion to $4.2 billion and $3.2  billion,  respectively.  The  increases in the
deficits were largely related to Excite@Home.  In 2000,  restructuring and other
charges,  net of minority  interest,  were $2.8 billion higher  primarily due to
goodwill  impairment  charges  recorded  by  Excite@Home  and  AT&T  related  to
Excite@Home.  Other impacts included a charge of approximately  $0.5 billion for
the fair market value increase of put options held by Comcast and Cox related to
Excite@Home,  and operating losses from Excite@Home.  Partially offsetting these
declines  were an increase in the pension  credit due to a higher  pension trust
asset base  resulting  from  increased  investment  returns,  and lower expenses
associated  with  our  continued  efforts  to  reduce  costs,  which  aggregated
approximately  $1.0  billion.  In  addition,   higher  net  gains  on  sales  of
investments  and an  increase in interest  income  increased  EBIT and EBITDA by
approximately $0.6 billion.

         In 1999,  EBIT and EBITDA  deficits  improved by $1.6  billion and $2.0
billion to $1.6 billion and $0.9 billion,  respectively.  The improvements  were
driven by $2.1  billion  of lower net  restructuring  and other  charges in 1999
compared with 1998,  partially  offset by lower gains on the sales of businesses
and lower interest  income,  which  negatively  impacted EBIT and EBITDA by $0.3
billion.  Additionally,  EBIT was  impacted  by  dividends  on  trust  preferred
securities. In 1998, AT&T recorded a gain on the sale of ASCC.

OTHER ITEMS

         Capital  additions  increased  $0.7  billion in 2000.  The increase was
driven by our  investment  in 2000 in  Net2Phone,  Inc.  (Net2Phone),  partially
offset  by lower  investments  in  international  nonconsolidated  subsidiaries.
Capital   additions   increased  $0.9  billion  in  1999  reflecting   increased
international equity investments that support our global strategy.

         Total assets increased $2.9 billion at December 31, 2000, primarily due
to our investments in Concert and Net2Phone.

LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP

         LMG produces,  acquires and distributes entertainment,  educational and
informational  programming services through all available formats and media. LMG
is also engaged in  electronic-retailing  services,  direct-marketing  services,
advertising sales relating to programming services, infomercials and transaction

<PAGE>

processing.  Earnings from LMG were $1.5 billion in 2000 compared with losses of
$2.0  billion  from the date of  acquisition  through  December  31,  1999.  The
increase was primarily due to gains on dispositions,  including gains associated
with the mergers of various  companies that LMG had  investments  in. Gains were
recorded for the difference  between the carrying value of LMG's interest in the
acquired  company and the fair value of  securities  received in the merger.  In
addition,   lower  stock  compensation   expense  in  2000  compared  with  1999
contributed to the increase.  These were partially offset by impairment  charges
recorded on LMG's investments to reflect other than temporary  declines in value
and higher losses relating to LMG's equity affiliates.

</TABLE>

         In 2000,  net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of  continuing
operations  increased  $1.8  billion.  The increase was  primarily  driven by an
increase  in net  income  excluding  the  noncash  impact  of  depreciation  and
amortization,  net  restructuring and other charges and minority interest income
(expense).  In 1999,  net cash  provided by operating  activities  of continuing
operations  increased $1.3 billion,  primarily due to an increase in net income,
excluding the noncash impact of depreciation and amortization, net restructuring
and other charges and the impact of earnings and losses from equity investments.
This  increase was  partially  offset by higher  receivables,  due  primarily to
higher  revenue,  and an increase in tax payments from the gain on the 1998 sale
of UCS.

         AT&T's  investing  activities  resulted  in a net use of cash of  $39.9
billion  in  2000,  compared  with a net use of cash of $27.0  billion  in 1999.
During  2000,  AT&T  used  approximately   $21.4  billion  for  acquisitions  of
businesses, primarily MediaOne, and spent $15.5 billion on capital expenditures.
During 1999,  AT&T spent  approximately  $14.3 billion on capital  expenditures,
approximately  $6.7 billion on acquisitions  of businesses,  primarily AGNS, and
contributed  $5.5 billion of cash to LMG. During 1998, we received $10.8 billion
related to the sales of businesses,  including  receivables from UCS,  partially
offset by capital expenditures of $7.8 billion.

         During  2000,  net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was $25.7
billion,  compared  with $13.4 billion in 1999.  In 2000,  AT&T  received  $10.3
billion from the AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  offering and borrowed an
additional  $17.0 billion of  short-term  debt and $2.5 billion of net long-term
debt.  These were partially  offset by the payment of $3.0 billion in dividends.
In 1999,  AT&T received $10.2 billion from the issuance of commercial  paper and
short-term  debt,  $5.6 billion from the net issuance of long-term debt and $4.6
billion from the issuance of redeemable preferred  securities.  These sources of
cash were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of $4.6 billion
and the payment of dividends of $2.7 billion.  Cash used in financing activities
in 1998  primarily  related to repayment of long-term and  short-term  debt, the
acquisition of treasury shares and dividends paid on common stock.
<PAGE>

         At  December  31,  2000,  we had  current  assets of $17.1  billion and
current  liabilities  of $50.9  billion.  A  significant  portion of the current
liabilities,  $31.9 billion,  relates to short-term notes, the majority of which
were commercial paper or debt with an original  maturity of one year or less. We
expect that we will retire a portion of the short-term debt with other financing
arrangements,  including the monetization of publicly-held securities,  sales of
certain  non-strategic  assets and investments,  and  securitization  of certain
accounts  receivable.  At December 31, 2000, we had a current  liability of $2.6
billion, reflecting our obligation under put options held by Comcast and Cox. In
January 2001,  Comcast and Cox exercised  their rights under the put options and
elected to receive AT&T stock in lieu of cash.  Since December 31, 2000, we have
announced  the sale of  investments  or assets,  which will result in gross cash
proceeds of approximately  $4.6 billion.  In addition,  on February 28, 2001, we
exercised our registration rights in TWE and formally requested TWE to begin the
process of converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registered
equity securities. We have, however,  continued our ongoing discussions with AOL
Time Warner for the sale of our stake in TWE.

         In connection with the planned split-off of AT&T Wireless, we announced
that we will retain up to $3.0 billion in shares of AT&T Wireless, which we will
dispose of within six months  following the split-off.  Also in connection  with
the split-off,  on March 6, 2001, AT&T Wireless  completed a $6.5 billion global
bond  offering.  AT&T  Wireless will  ultimately  use the proceeds to repay $4.8
billion in notes  receivable  and  preferred  stock that AT&T Common Stock Group
holds in AT&T  Wireless.  In addition on March 23, 2001,  AT&T Wireless  entered
into $2.5 billion in  revolving  credit  facilities.  The  facilities  include a
364-day tranche and a 5-year tranche.  The facilities are for general  corporate
purposes.

         Another aspect of our restructuring is the expected sale, in late-2001,
of a new class of stock which will track our Broadband business.

         AT&T is in a joint  venture  with  Alaska  Native  Wireless  (ANW).  At
December 31, 2000,  AT&T had  committed to fund ANW up to $2.4 billion  based on
the outcome of FCC license  spectrum  auction.  In January 2001, the auction was
completed  and ANW was the  highest  bidder on  approximately  $2.9  billion  in
licenses.

         Since the announced  restructuring plans to create four new businesses,
AT&T's debt ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies. As
a result of this review, AT&T's ratings have been downgraded and continued to be
on credit watch with negative outlook. These actions will result in an increased
cost of future borrowings and will limit our access to the capital markets.

         AT&T is pursuing  various  measures to reduce its debt level.  However,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on terms that
are acceptable to us. If these efforts cannot be completed  successfully,  or on
terms and within the timeframe contemplated, AT&T's financial condition would be
materially  adversely  affected.  Some of these adverse  conditions  include the
company's ability to pursue  acquisitions,  make capital  expenditures to expand
its network and cable plant, or pay dividends.

         On  December  28,  2000,  we  entered  into  a  364-day,   $25  billion
revolving-credit  facility  syndicated to 39 banks, which was unused at December
31, 2000. As a result of certain  transactions  subsequent to December 31, 2000,
specifically  the  investment  by NTT DoCoMo of $9.8  billion for a new class of
AT&T preferred  stock,  and the $6.5 billion AT&T Wireless bond  offering,  this
credit facility was reduced to $18.3 billion.
<PAGE>

         Also  in  connection  with  our  restructuring,  we have  reviewed  our
dividend  policy as it relates to each of the new  businesses.  On December  20,
2000, we announced that the board of directors reduced AT&T's quarterly dividend
to $0.0375 per share, from $0.22 per share.

         Our board of directors  has the power to make  determinations  that may
impact the  financial  and  liquidity  position  of each of the  tracking  stock
groups. This power includes the ability to set priorities for use of capital and
debt  capacity,  to determine  cash  management  policies and to make  decisions
regarding  whether to make capital  expenditures and as to the timing and amount
of any capital  expenditures.  All actions by the board of directors are subject
to the board members fiduciary duties to all shareholders of AT&T as a group and
not just to holders of a  particular  class of tracking  stock and to our policy
statements, by-laws and inter-company agreements. As a result of this discretion
of our board of  directors,  it may be  difficult  for  investors to assess each
group's liquidity and capital resource needs and in turn the future prospects of
each group based on past performance.

RISK MANAGEMENT

         We are  exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign
exchange  rates,  as well as changes in equity prices  associated with affiliate
companies.  In addition,  we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the
prices of  securities  which we  monetized  through the  issuance of debt.  On a
limited  basis,  we use  certain  derivative  financial  instruments,  including
interest  rate swaps,  options,  forwards,  equity  hedges and other  derivative
contracts,  to manage  these  risks.  We do not use  financial  instruments  for
trading  or  speculative  purposes.   All  financial  instruments  are  used  in
accordance with board-approved policies.

         We use  interest  rate  swaps to manage  the  impact of  interest  rate
changes  on  earnings  and cash  flows and also to lower our  overall  borrowing
costs.  We monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.
Assuming a 10% downward shift in interest rates, the fair value of interest rate
swaps and the  underlying  hedged debt would have  changed by $10 million and $3
million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  In 2000, we entered into a
combined interest rate,  forward contract to hedge  foreign-currency-denominated
debt.  Assuming a 10%  downward  shift in both  interest  rates and the  foreign
currency,  the fair value of the contract and the  underlying  hedged debt would
have changed by $88 million. In addition,  certain debt is indexed to the market
prices of  securities we own.  Changes in the market prices of these  securities
result in changes in the fair value of this debt. Assuming a 10% downward change
in the market price of these  securities,  the fair value of the underlying debt
and  securities  would have  decreased  by $534  million at December  31,  2000.
Assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest  rates at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
the fair value of unhedged  debt would have  increased  by $1.2 billion and $938
million, respectively.

         We use forward and option  contracts to reduce our exposure to the risk
of  adverse  changes  in  currency  exchange  rates.  We are  subject to foreign
exchange  risk  for  foreign-currency-denominated  transactions,  such  as  debt
issued. In addition, in 1999 we were subject to foreign exchange risk related to
reimbursements to foreign  telephone  companies for their portion of the revenue
billed by AT&T for calls placed in the United  States to a foreign  country.  We
monitor  our foreign  exchange  rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value.
Assuming a 10%  appreciation  in the U.S.  dollar at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
the fair value of these contracts  would have resulted in additional  unrealized
losses of $6 million and $29 million, respectively.  Because these contracts are
entered into for hedging purposes, we believe that these losses would be largely
offset by gains on the underlying firmly committed or anticipated transactions.

         We use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity prices
associated  with  stock  appreciation  rights  (SARs) of  affiliated  companies.
Assuming a 10% decrease in equity prices of affiliated companies, the fair value
of the equity  hedges  would have  decreased  by $29  million and $81 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Because these  contracts are entered
into for hedging  purposes,  we believe that the decrease in fair value would be
largely offset by gains on the underlying transaction.

         In  order  to  determine  the  changes  in fair  value  of our  various
financial instruments, we use certain modeling techniques, namely Black-Scholes,
for our SARs and equity collars.  We apply rate sensitivity  changes directly to
our interest rate swap  transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign
currency forward contracts.
<PAGE>

         The changes in fair value, as discussed above, assume the occurrence of
certain adverse market conditions.  They do not consider the potential effect of
favorable  changes in market  factors and do not represent  projected  losses in
fair  value  that we expect to incur.  Future  impacts  would be based on actual
developments  in global  financial  markets.  We do not foresee any  significant
changes in the strategies  used to manage interest rate risk,  foreign  currency
rate risk or equity price risk in the near future.

Total assets....................................................................       $242,223      $169,406
Total liabilities...............................................................        129,432        83,388
Total shareowners' equity.......................................................        103,198        78,927
</TABLE>

         Total assets  increased $72.8 billion,  or 43.0%, at December 31, 2000,
primarily  due to the impact of the  MediaOne  acquisition,  which  resulted  in
increased  goodwill,  franchise  costs,  other  investments  including  TWE  and
Vodafone Group plc; and the addition of property, plant and equipment. Property,
plant and equipment also increased due to capital  expenditures  made during the
year, net of  depreciation  expense and equipment  contributed to Concert.  This
equipment  contribution,  as well as a $1.0  billion  loan to  Concert,  and our
investment  in  Net2Phone  are  reflected  as an increase to other  investments.
Additionally, other receivables increased due to Concert. Wireless acquisitions,
including the impact of  consolidating  former equity  investments,  resulted in
increased licensing costs.

         Total  liabilities at December 31, 2000,  increased  $46.0 billion,  or
55.2%,  primarily due to the impact of the MediaOne acquisition,  including debt
of MediaOne and borrowings to fund the acquisition, as well as the consolidation
of Excite@Home. In addition, total debt increased due to the monetization of our
investments in Microsoft Corporation and Comcast.

         Minority  interest  increased  $2.5 billion to $4.9 billion,  primarily
reflecting the minority interest of our ownership of Excite@Home  resulting from
the consolidation of Excite@Home  beginning September 1, 2000, and the preferred
stock outstanding of a MediaOne subsidiary.

         Total  shareowners'  equity was $103.2 billion at December 31, 2000, an
increase of 30.8% from December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to the
issuance  of AT&T  common  stock  for the  MediaOne  acquisition  as well as the
issuance of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.

         The ratio of total debt to total  capital,  excluding LMG (debt divided
by total  debt and  equity,  excluding  LMG) was  46.2% at  December  31,  2000,
compared with 43.0% at December 31, 1999. The equity portion of this calculation
includes  convertible  trust  preferred   securities,   as  well  as  subsidiary
redeemable  preferred  stock.  The increase was primarily  driven by higher debt
associated  with the MediaOne  merger,  largely  offset by a higher  equity base
associated  with the MediaOne  merger and the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
offering.  The ratio of debt (net of cash) to EBITDA was 3.28X at  December  31,
2000,  compared  with 1.88X at December 31,  1999,  reflecting  additional  debt
associated with the MediaOne  merger.  Included in debt was  approximately  $8.7
billion of notes, which are exchangeable into or collateralized by securities we
own. Excluding this debt, the ratio of  net-debt-to-EBITDA at December 31, 2000,
was 2.84X.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities."  Among other  provisions,  it
requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the  statement of financial  position and measure those  instruments  at fair
value.  Gains and losses  resulting  from  changes  in the fair  values of those
derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the  derivative  and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date for this standard
was delayed via the  issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective  date for SFAS No.
133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after  June 15,  2000,  though  earlier
adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited. For AT&T, this
means that the standard must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001.

         In June 2000,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  138,  "Accounting  for Certain
Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities" as an amendment to SFAS
No.  133.  This  statement   provides   clarification  with  regard  to  certain
implementation issues under SFAS No. 133 on specific types of hedges.

         On January 1, 2001, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 133. We recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$1.4 billion of income,  or  approximately  $0.34 per diluted  share,  primarily
attributable  to fair value  adjustments of debt  instruments,  including  those
acquired in  conjunction  with the  MediaOne  merger,  as well as to our warrant
portfolio.  In  addition,  in  connection  with the adoption of SFAS No. 133, we
reclassified certain investment  securities,  which support debt that is indexed
to   those   securities,    from   "available-for-sale"   to   "trading."   This
reclassification  resulted in the  recognition of a charge of $2.8 billion ($1.7
billion after income taxes), or approximately $0.43 per diluted share, which was
recorded as a  reduction  of other  income.  As  available-for-sale  securities,
changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive income
as a component of shareowners'  equity.  In addition,  LMG recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$0.8 billion of income, or approximately $0.31 per share.

         The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138,
on AT&T's future  results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of our
derivatives  and related  financial  instruments  and could result in pronounced
quarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods.

         In  September  2000,  the FASB  issued SFAS No.  140,  "Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities
- -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." This statement provides  accounting
and reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of  liabilities.  Under  these  standards,  after a transfer of
financial  assets,  an entity  recognizes the financial and servicing  assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered,  and derecognizes  liabilities when  extinguished.
This statement provides  consistent  standards for  distinguishing  transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. This
statement is  effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of liabilities  occurring  after March 31, 2001.  AT&T does not
expect that the  adoption of SFAS No. 140 will have a material  impact on AT&T's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         On January 12, 2001,  AT&T announced that Cox and Comcast had exercised
their  rights to sell a combined  total of 60.4  million  shares of  Excite@Home
Series A common stock to AT&T as part of an  agreement  announced in August 2000
to  reorganize  Excite@Home's  governance.  Cox and  Comcast  elected to receive
shares of AT&T common stock in exchange for their  Excite@Home  shares.  AT&T is
currently in discussions  to renegotiate  the terms of the put options which may
result in a change to the number of shares of AT&T  stock  that Cox and  Comcast
will receive, as well as the number of Excite@Home shares, if any AT&T receives.
There  can be no  assurances  that an  agreement  will be  reached  with Cox and
Comcast.

         On  January  22,  2001,  AT&T  and NTT  DoCoMo  (DoCoMo)  finalized  an
agreement whereby DoCoMo invested  approximately $9.8 billion for a new class of
AT&T  preferred  stock,   termed  DoCoMo  Wireless   tracking  stock,   that  is
economically  equivalent to 406 million  shares of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking
stock and reflects  approximately 16% of the financial  performance and economic
value of AT&T Wireless  Group.  AT&T  allocated  $6.2 billion of the proceeds to
AT&T Wireless Group. Each share of DoCoMo Wireless tracking stock is convertible
at any time into AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.  Upon the conversion of the
DoCoMo Wireless  tracking  stock,  AT&T will reduce its portion of the financial
performance and economic value in AT&T Wireless Group by 178 million shares, and
the balance of the 406 million shares will come from the issuance of 228 million
new shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. Additionally,  upon completion
of the planned  split-off of AT&T Wireless,  the DoCoMo Wireless  tracking stock
and related  warrants will  automatically  be converted into AT&T Wireless Group
tracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other shares
of AT&T Wireless Group  tracking stock in the split-off.  In the event that AT&T
has not split-off AT&T Wireless by specified  dates  beginning  January 1, 2002,
DoCoMo will have the right, at its election,  to require AT&T to repurchase from
DoCoMo  the  preferred  shares  initially  issued to them at  DoCoMo's  original
purchase price plus interest up to the date of payment.  The interest under this
right will be treated as preferred  stock  dividends with charges  recorded as a
reduction of AT&T Common Stock Group  earnings.  In  addition,  DoCoMo  acquired
five-year  warrants to purchase the  equivalent  of an  additional  41.7 million
shares of AT&T Wireless Group  tracking  stock at $35 per share.  As part of the
agreement,  DoCoMo  obtained  a seat on AT&T's  board of  directors  until  AT&T
Wireless is split-off from AT&T as a separate public company,  which is expected
to occur later in 2001. At that time,  DoCoMo will retain  representation on the
new public AT&T Wireless board.

         In January  2001,  AT&T entered into  agreements  with certain  network
equipment  vendors,  which  extend  through  2004,  to purchase  next-generation
wireless network equipment for a total of approximately $1.8 billion.

         On February 27, 2001,  AT&T  entered  into an agreement  with  Vodafone
Group plc to sell our 10% stake in Japan Telecom Co. Ltd for approximately $1.35
billion in cash.  The  transaction is expected to be completed in April 2001 and
will result in a gain.

         On March 1, 2001, AT&T Wireless  completed a private  placement of $6.5
billion in notes.  The notes pay  interest at rates  ranging from 7.35% to 8.75%
per annum,  with  maturity  dates  ranging from 2006 to 2031.  The notes include
customary covenants and registration rights.

         On March 23, 2001, AT&T Wireless entered into $2.5 billion in revolving
credit facilities. The facilities consist of a 364-day facility of $1.25 billion
and a five-year  revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion.  The facilities may
be used for general  corporate  purposes and are subject to customary  covenants
and events of default.

           AT&T Wireless Group Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                  Results of Operations and Financial Condition

      Overview

         AT&T  Wireless  Group is an  integrated  business  of AT&T and is not a
stand-alone entity. As AT&T Wireless Group is a tracking stock of AT&T, separate
financial  statements  are  not  required  to be  filed.  We have  provided  the
financial  statements  as an exhibit  to  this  document to  provide  additional
disclosures  to investors to allow them to assess the financial  performance  of
AT&T Wireless Group. Since the tracking stocks are governed by a common board of
directors,  the AT&T board of directors  could make  operational  and  financial
decisions or implement policies that affect disproportionately the businesses of
any group.  For example,  our board of directors may decide to transfer funds or
to  reallocate  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  expenses  and cash flows  among
groups,  without  the  consent  of  shareholders.  All  actions  by the board of
directors are subject to the board members' fiduciary duties to all shareholders
of AT&T as a group and not just to holders  of a  particular  class of  tracking
stock  and  to  our  charter,  policy  statements,   by-laws  and  inter-company
agreements.

         Our board of directors may change or supplement  the policies set forth
in the tracking stock policy  statements and our by-laws in the sole  discretion
of our  board  of  directors,  subject  to  the  provisions  of any  inter-group
agreement but without approval of our shareholders.  In addition,  the fact that
we have separate  classes of common stock could give rise to occasions  when the
interests of the holders of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless Group common stock
and Liberty Media Group tracking stock diverge, conflict or appear to diverge or
conflict.  Our board of  directors  would  make any  change or  addition  to the
policies set forth in the tracking stock policy  statements or our by-laws,  and
would respond to any actual or apparent divergence of interest among our groups,
in a  manner  consistent  with  its  fiduciary  duties  to  AT&T  and all of our
shareholders after giving  consideration to the potentially  divergent interests
and all other relevant  interests of the holders of the separate  classes of our
shares.

         You should consider that as a result of the flexibility provided to our
board of  directors,  it may be  difficult  for  investors  to assess the future
prospects of a tracking stock group based on that group's past performance.



          On  April 27,  2000,  AT&T  completed  an  offering  of 15.6%,  or 360
      million shares, of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an offering price
      of $29.50 per share. AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock is a class of AT&T
      common stock,  which is intended to provide holders with financial returns
      based on the financial  performance  and economic value of AT&T's wireless
      services'  businesses.  AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking stock issued in the
      offering  reflected only a portion of the authorized shares. The remaining
      84.4% has been  reserved for the benefit of AT&T Common Stock Group (which
      consists of the  operations  of AT&T other than those  attributed  to AT&T
      tracking stocks) and is intended to be reflected in AT&T common stock.

          AT&T  Wireless  Group  includes  the results of its mobility and fixed
      wireless  businesses,  as  well  as its  international  operations,  which
      primarily  include the earnings or losses associated with equity interests
      in international wireless communications ventures and partnerships.

          The combined  financial  statements of AT&T Wireless  Group  primarily
      include the legal entity  results of AT&T Wireless  Services,  Inc and its
      subsidiaries (AWS), AT&T Wireless Group, LLC (AWG), AT&T Wireless PCS, LLC
      and it  subsidiaries  (AWPCS),  and  Winston,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries
      (Winston),  all of which are  direct  subsidiaries  of AT&T  Corp.,  as of
      December 31, 2000.  In February  2001,  the legal  entities of Winston and
      AWPCS as well as  certain  assets  of AWG  were  transferred  to AWS.  The
      remaining  assets and liabilities of AWG will be transferred  prior to the
      split-off.

          On  October  25,  2000,  AT&T  announced  its  decision  to present an
      exchange  offer to AT&T common  shareowners  to allow them to exchange any
      portion of shares of AT&T common stock for shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
      tracking stock. On December 22, 2000, AT&T filed a registration  statement
      for the exchange offer with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  which
      was amended on February 23, 2001. AT&T anticipates that the exchange offer
      will be completed  during the second quarter of 2001.  AT&T Wireless Group
      will  continue  to be a part  of  AT&T  following  the  completion  of the
      exchange offer.

          Also on October 25, 2000, AT&T announced  its restructuring  plan.  In
      connection with their restructuring plan,  following the completion of the
      exchange  offer  and  subject  to  certain  conditions,  AT&T  intends  to
      split-off  AT&T Wireless  Group from AT&T.  These  conditions  include the
      receipt of a favorable  ruling on the split-off from the Internal  Revenue
      Service (IRS) and  satisfaction of conditions  contained in AT&T's new $25
      billion credit agreement, including the repayment of AT&T Wireless Group's
      intercompany  obligations to AT&T. The split-off,  which is anticipated to
      be completed in mid-2001, would include several steps. These steps include
      transferring  substantially  all of the  assets  and  liabilities  of AT&T
      Wireless Group to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., mandatorily exchanging all
      issued and  outstanding  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,
      including those issued in the exchange offer,  for shares of AT&T Wireless
      Services common stock,  and  distributing a majority of the shares of AT&T
      Wireless Services common stock held by AT&T Common Stock Group, to holders
      of AT&T common  stock on a pro rata  basis.  On February  14,  2001,  AT&T
      announced  its  intention  to  retain up to $3  billion  of shares of AT&T
      Wireless  Services  for its own account  for sale or  exchange  within six
      months of the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory IRS ruling.
<PAGE>
          In  January  2001,   NTT   DoCoMo,   a   leading   Japanese   wireless
      communications company,  invested $9.8 billion in a security of AT&T that,
      like AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock, is intended to reflect a portion
      of the financial  performance  and economic value of AT&T Wireless  Group.
      AT&T Wireless Group,  through AT&T Wireless Group, LLC, was allocated $6.2
      billion of the proceeds  from  DoCoMo's  $9.8 billion  investment in AT&T.
      AT&T retained the remaining $3.6 billion of the DoCoMo investment proceeds
      as  consideration  for the  reduction in AT&T's  retained  portion of AT&T
      Wireless Group's value.  Following the split-off,  this investment will be
      converted into approximately 16% of AT&T Wireless Services' common shares.
      DoCoMo  also  received  warrants  at an  exercise  price  of $35 per  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  tracking  share   equivalent   that  would  represent  an
      approximate additional 1.6% of AT&T Wireless Services' common shares after
      the split-off.  As part of this investment,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through
      AT&T Wireless  Services,  Inc., has entered into a strategic alliance with
      DoCoMo  to  develop  mobile  multimedia  services  on  a  global-standard,
      high-speed  wireless  network.  DoCoMo may require the  repurchase  of its
      investment at DoCoMo's  original  purchase price,  plus interest,  if AT&T
      does not complete the split-off by specified  dates  beginning  January 1,
      2002 or if AT&T  Wireless  Group  fails  to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.

      Acquisitions

          On December  29, 2000,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through AWS and AWPCS,
      completed the acquisition of a wireless system in Houston,  which covers a
      population  base of  approximately  five million  potential  customers and
      served  approximately 180 thousand subscribers as of the acquisition date.
      Also on December 29, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group's  equity  interest in AB
      Cellular,  an entity  which  owned  cellular  properties  in Los  Angeles,
      Houston and Galveston,  Texas, was redeemed.  In  consideration  for their
      equity interest,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS,  received 100% of the
      net assets of the Los Angeles property.  The Los Angeles property covers a
      population base of  approximately 15 million  potential  customers and had
      approximately 1.3 million subscribers as of December 31, 2000. On November
      14, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWPCS, completed a transaction with
      their  affiliate  Telecorp  PCS  which  resulted  in AT&T  Wireless  Group
      acquiring  wireless systems in several New England markets.  On October 2,
      2000, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWPCS,  completed the acquisition of a
      wireless   system  in   Indianapolis.   Combined,   the  New  England  and
      Indianapolis  markets cover a population  base of  approximately 4 million
      potential customers,  and served approximately 145 thousand subscribers as
      of their acquisition dates.

          On September 29, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, completed the
      acquisition of a wireless  system in San Diego,  which covers a population
      base of 3 million  potential  customers.  Also,  during the third quarter,
      AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, completed its acquisition of a wireless
      system on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Combined,  these two  markets  served
      more than 180 thousand subscribers as of their acquisition dates.

          In June 2000, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, closed the acquisition
      of the remaining 50% partnership interest it previously did not own in CMT
      Partners (Bay Area Properties). The Bay Area Properties cover a population
      base exceeding 7 million  potential  customers and, as of the  acquisition
      date,  served nearly 1 million  subscribers.  Also in June,  AT&T Wireless
      Group, through AWS, completed its acquisition of Wireless One Network, L.P
      (Wireless  One).  Wireless  One  owns and  operates  wireless  systems  in
      Northwest and Southwest  Florida covering a population base of 1.6 million
      potential  customers and had approximately 190 thousand  subscribers as of
      the acquisition date.
<PAGE>
          In February 2000, AWS and Dobson Communications Corporation, through a
      joint venture,  acquired American Cellular  Corporation.  AT&T contributed
      cash equal to AWS' interest in the joint venture to AT&T Wireless Group as
      of the date of the acquisition.  This acquisition  increased AT&T Wireless
      Group's  coverage in New York State and several mid-west markets by adding
      approximately 450 thousand subscribers as of the acquisition date.

               AT&T Wireless Group Combined Results of Operations
                      For the Year Ended December 31, 2000
                 Compared With the Year Ended December 31, 1999

      Revenue

          Total revenue includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of
      handsets  and  accessories,  and  revenue  associated  with  the  aviation
      communications and fixed wireless operations.  AT&T Wireless Group records
      revenue as services  are  provided  or when the product is sold.  Services
      revenue  primarily  includes monthly recurring  charges,  airtime and toll
      usage charges, and roaming charges billed to subscribers for usage outside
      of AT&T  Wireless  Group's  network  as well as  charges  billed  to other
      wireless  providers  for roaming on AT&T  Wireless  Group's  network.  The
      revenue  and  related  expenses  associated  with the  sales  of  wireless
      handsets and  accessories  are recognized  when the products are delivered
      and  accepted  by the  customer,  as this is  considered  to be a separate
      earnings process from the sale of wireless services.

          Total revenue  increased  37.0% to $10,448  million for the year ended
      December 31, 2000,  compared with the prior year. Total revenue  increased
      29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000,  compared with 1999,  adjusted
      to exclude the Bay Area  Properties  for the six months ended December 31,
      2000,  and to exclude  Vanguard  Cellular  for the period  January 2000 to
      April  2000,  to  correlate  results  with  1999,  due  to  the  May  1999
      acquisition.  The revenue  increase for the year ended  December 31, 2000,
      was primarily due to growth in our mobility  business  revenue,  including
      both growth in services and equipment revenue.

          Services  revenue for the year ended  December  31,  2000,  was $9,376
      million, an increase of $2,553 million, or 37.4%,  compared with 1999. The
      services  revenue  growth  was  driven by strong  consolidated  subscriber
      growth.  Additionally,  an  increase in average  monthly  revenue per user
      (ARPU) for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared with the prior year,
      contributed  to  the  revenue  growth.  AT&T  Digital  One  Rate  service,
      including  additional  calling plans  introduced in August 2000 as well as
      the AT&T Regional and Digital  advantage plans announced during the second
      quarter of 2000,  continue to contribute to growth in  subscribers as well
      as an increase in ARPU.

          As of December 31, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group had nearly 15.2 million
      consolidated  subscribers,  an increase of 58.5%,  compared with the prior
      year,  of  which  90.1%  were  digital  subscribers,  up from  79.2% as of
      December 31, 1999. Consolidated subscribers at December 31, 2000, included
      approximately  3.0 million  subscribers  associated with acquisitions that
      closed during 2000. Net consolidated  wireless subscriber additions in the
      year ended December 31, 2000, totaled nearly 2.6 million, a 67.5% increase
      over the prior year,  including  865 thousand  during the fourth  quarter.
      AT&T  Wireless  Group's  average  monthly  churn  rate for the year  ended
      December 31, 2000, was 2.9% compared with 2.6% for the year ended December
      31, 1999. AT&T Wireless  Group's  average  monthly churn increased  during
      2000 as a  result  of  competitive  pressures,  as  well as AT&T  Wireless
      Group's  efforts to expand the  customers  they serve to a broader base of
      consumer segments.  Total subscribers,  including  partnership  markets in
      which AT&T Wireless Group does not own a controlling  interest,  were over
      15.7 million at the end of 2000, a 28.9% increase over the prior year. Due
      to the redemption of AT&T Wireless  Group's interest in AB Cellular during
      the fourth quarter of 2000, the Houston market  subscribers of AB Cellular
      are no longer included in AT&T Wireless Group's total subscribers.  Ending
      total  subscribers   included   approximately  450  thousand   subscribers
      associated with AT&T Wireless Group's  acquisition of American Cellular in
      February 2000.
<PAGE>
          AT&T Wireless  Group's ARPU for the year ended  December 31, 2000, was
      $68.2, an increase of $2.4, or 3.6%,  compared with 1999. The increase was
      primarily due to increased  minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part
      by the  continued  success of AT&T Digital One Rate service and other rate
      plans  introduced  in 2000.  AT&T Wireless  Group's ARPU trended  downward
      during the second half of 2000 as a result of market segmentation efforts.
      Despite this, AT&T Wireless Group's ARPU remained higher than the wireless
      industry  average during the year ended December 31, 2000,  excluding AT&T
      Wireless  Group.  As a result of our  market  segmentation  efforts,  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  anticipates  that ARPU will  decline in 2001  relative to
      2000.

          Equipment  revenue for the year ended  December 31,  2000,  was $1,072
      million, an increase of $268 million,  or 33.2%,  compared with 1999. This
      increase  was  primarily  due to a 53.6%  increase  in gross  consolidated
      subscriber  additions  during the year ended  December 31, 2000,  compared
      with 1999.  As an integral  part of the wireless  service  offering,  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  supplies to its  subscribers  a selection  of handsets at
      competitive prices, which are generally offered at or below cost.

      Costs of services

          Costs of  services  include  the costs to place calls over the network
      (including the costs to operate and maintain AT&T Wireless Group's network
      as well as roaming costs paid to other wireless providers) and the charges
      paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of AT&T.

          Costs of services for the year ended  December  31, 2000,  were $3,169
      million, an increase of $589 million,  or 22.9%,  compared with 1999. This
      increase was due primarily to growth in the mobility  subscriber  base and
      their increased minutes of use which resulted in an increase in the access
      and other  connection  charges  paid to connect  calls on other  networks,
      including  AT&T, as well as the costs to maintain  AT&T  Wireless  Group's
      network. The costs of services associated with AT&T Wireless Group's fixed
      wireless  business  increased  during  2000 as a result of the  commercial
      launch of  service  in several  markets.  Additionally,  during the fourth
      quarter, AT&T Wireless Group's costs of services included asset write-offs
      associated with changes in AT&T Wireless Group's strategy for markets that
      overlap with AT&T's broadband markets

      Costs of equipment sales

          Costs  of  equipment  sales  include  the  costs of the  handsets  and
      accessories provided to AT&T Wireless Group customers.  Costs of equipment
      sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $2,041  million.  This was
      an increase of $775 million,  or 61.2%,  compared with 1999. This increase
      was due  primarily to higher gross  subscriber  additions in 2000 compared
      with the prior year.

      Selling, general and administrative

          Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  for the  year  ended
      December 31, 2000, were $3,590  million,  compared with $2,663 million for
      the year ended December 31, 1999,  representing an increase of 34.8%. This
      increase was largely  attributable to higher  marketing and selling costs,
      primarily  advertising  and  commissions,  associated with the increase in
      gross  consolidated  subscriber  additions for the year ended December 31,
      2000, compared to 1999. Cost per gross subscriber  addition (CPGA),  which
      includes  the costs of handset  subsidies  recorded in costs of  equipment
      sales,  was $367 for both the year ended  December 31, 2000,  and 1999. In
<PAGE>
      addition,  growth in the wireless customer base resulted in an increase in
      information technology and customer care related expenses.

      Depreciation and amortization

          Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31,
      2000, were $1,686 million, an increase of $433 million, or 34.5%, compared
      with 1999. This increase  primarily  resulted from growth in AT&T Wireless
      Group's  depreciable  asset base  resulting from capital  expenditures  to
      increase  the  capacity of the network and  improve  call  quality.  Total
      capital  expenditures were $4,287 million and $2,476 million for the years
      ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Additionally, amortization
      expense,  which includes  amortization of licensing costs,  goodwill,  and
      other  intangibles,  increased for the year ended  December 31, 2000, as a
      result  of  the  1999  acquisitions  of  Vanguard  Cellular  and  Honolulu
      Cellular,  as well  as the  2000  acquisitions,  primarily  the  Bay  Area
      Properties and Wireless One which closed during June 2000.

      Asset impairment and restructuring charges

          During the fourth quarter of 1999, AT&T Wireless Group recorded a $531
      million asset  impairment  charge  primarily  associated  with the planned
      disposal of wireless communications  equipment resulting from a program to
      increase capacity and operating efficiency of the wireless network.

      Other income

          Other income primarily  includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges
      of assets,  intercompany interest income on the note receivable from AT&T,
      and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.  Other income for the
      year ended December 31, 2000, was $534 million, compared with $122 million
      for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase for the year ended
      December 31, 2000, was due primarily to the pretax gain of $379 million on
      the  transactions   associated  with  AT&T  Wireless   Group's   affiliate
      investment in Telecorp PCS,  interest  income on the note  receivable from
      AT&T,  partially  offset by a pretax loss of $184 million  associated with
      the  acquisition of the Los Angeles  cellular  property  resulting from AB
      Cellular's  redemption  of AT&T  Wireless  Group's  equity  interest in AB
      Cellular, as well as pretax gains recorded in 1999.

      Interest expense

          Interest expense consists  primarily of interest on intercompany  debt
      due to AT&T less interest  expense  capitalized.  Interest expense for the
      year ended December 31, 2000, was $85 million,  a decrease of $51 million,
      or 37.4%,  compared  with 1999.  The decrease was due to higher  levels of
      capitalized  interest as a result of increased  capital  expenditures,  as
      well as lower levels of average outstanding debt due to AT&T. The decrease
      in the  average  outstanding  debt  due to AT&T  was  attributable  to the
      recapitalization  of $2.0  billion  of long  term debt due to AT&T into 9%
      cumulative preferred stock held by AT&T subsequent to the offering of AT&T
      Wireless Group tracking stock.  These decreases were partially offset by a
      higher rate of interest  charged on the  intercompany  debt in 2000 versus
      the prior year.

      Provision (benefit) for income taxes

          The provision  for income taxes for the year ended  December 31, 2000,
      was $141  million,  compared  with a benefit of $294  million for the year
      ended December 31, 1999. The effective  income tax rate for the year ended
      December  31,  2000 was 34.1%,  compared  with  43.2%,  for the year ended
      December 31, 1999.  The effective  rate for 2000 was impacted by increased
<PAGE>
      goodwill and other purchased  intangibles  amortization expense associated
      with  the  1999 and  2000  acquisitions  as well as the sale of a  foreign
      equity  investment during 2000. The effective income tax rate for 1999 was
      impacted by the benefit from a change in the valuation allowance and other
      estimates,   offset  by  amortization  of  goodwill  and  other  purchased
      intangibles.

      Net equity earnings (losses) from investments

          Net equity earnings  (losses) from  investments,  net of tax, was $388
      million of earnings for the year ended  December 31, 2000,  compared  with
      $19 million of losses for 1999.  The increase was  primarily due to a $372
      million  after-tax  gain  included in equity  earnings  for AT&T  Wireless
      Group's portion of the gain recognized by AB Cellular on the redemption of
      AT&T Wireless Group's equity interest in AB Cellular.

      Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T

          At December 31, 2000 and 1999,  AT&T Wireless  Group had  outstanding,
      $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock held by
      AT&T that pays  dividends at 9% per annum.  Long-term  debt due to AT&T of
      $2.0  billion was  recapitalized  into an  additional  $2.0  billion of 9%
      cumulative  preferred stock held by AT&T following the offering.  Dividend
      requirements on this preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2000,
      were $130  million  and for the year ended  December  31,  1999,  were $56
      million,  net of  amounts  recorded  in  accordance  with the tax  sharing
      agreement.

                      For the Year Ended December 31, 1999
                 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 1998

      Revenue

          Total  revenue  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999,  was  $7,627
      million, an increase of $2,221 million, or 41.1%, compared with 1998. AT&T
      Wireless  Group's  1999  results  included  Vanguard  Cellular  since  its
      acquisition  on May  3,1999,  and  1998  results  included  its  messaging
      business  until its sale on  October  2, 1998.  Adjusted  to exclude  both
      Vanguard  Cellular  and its  messaging  business,  total  revenue for AT&T
      Wireless Group increased by 39.0% compared with 1998.

          The revenue increase was driven  primarily by consolidated  subscriber
      growth and rising  ARPU.  As of December  31,  1999,  ending  consolidated
      subscribers  increased  33.4%  compared  with 1998.  AT&T Digital One Rate
      service significantly  contributed to the increase in ARPU and subscribers
      by acquiring and retaining high value customers,  who have a significantly
      higher ARPU than an average subscriber.

          Services  revenue for the year ended  December  31,  1999,  was $6,823
      million, an increase of $2,044 million, or 42.8%, compared with 1998.

          As  of  December  31,  1999,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  had  9.6  million
      consolidated  subscribers,  an increase of 33.4%  compared  with the prior
      year,  of  which  79.2%  were  digital  subscribers,  up from  60.7% as of
      December  31,  1998.  Included in these  figures  were  approximately  700
      thousand  subscribers  from our  acquisition  of Vanguard  Cellular in May
      1999,  approximately  125 thousand  subscribers  from our  acquisition  of
      Honolulu Cellular in August 1999 and approximately 45 thousand subscribers
      from our acquisition of Bakersfield Cellular in April 1999. Including AT&T
      Wireless Group's  partnership  markets,  approximately  9.4 million of the
      12.2 million total  subscribers  were digital  subscribers  as of December
      31,1999.
<PAGE>
          AT&T  Wireless  Group's ARPU for the year ended  December 31, 1999 was
      $65.8, an increase of $8.2, or 14.2%, compared with 1998. The increase was
      primarily due to increased  minutes of use per subscriber,  driven in part
      by the success of AT&T Digital One Rate  service.  AT&T  Wireless  Group's
      ARPU  remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average
      during 1999, excluding AT&T Wireless Group.

          Equipment  revenue  for the  year  ended  December  31,  1999 was $804
      million,  an increase of $177 million,  or 28.2%,  compared with 1998. The
      increase  was  primarily  due to a 25.1%  increase  in gross  consolidated
      subscriber  additions in 1999  compared  with 1998. As an integral part of
      the wireless  service  offering,  AT&T Wireless  Group supplies to its new
      subscribers  a  selection  of handsets at  competitive  prices,  which are
      generally offered at or below cost.

      Costs of services

          Costs of  services  for the year ended  December  31, 1999 were $2,580
      million.  This was an increase of $1,152 million, or 80.7%,  compared with
      1998. The increase was due primarily to roaming  expenses  associated with
      the  success  of AT&T  Digital  One Rate  service as  off-network  roaming
      minutes of use  increased by 194.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1999,
      compared with 1998.

          Although  roaming  expenses  continued to impact  results for the year
      ended  December  31, 1999,  the rate of roaming  expense  growth  declined
      significantly  during  the latter  half of 1999,  as AT&T  Wireless  Group
      introduced  initiatives  to  aggressively  migrate  more minutes onto AT&T
      Wireless  Group's network as well as reduced  intercarrier  roaming rates.
      AT&T Wireless Group continued to seek to decrease roaming expenses through
      capital  spending  for  network  expansion,   acquisitions  and  affiliate
      launches.  Roaming  rates  also  declined  significantly  as a  result  of
      renegotiated  roaming  agreements and the  deployment of IRDB  technology,
      which  assists in  identifying  favorable  roaming  partners  in areas not
      included in AT&T Wireless Group's  network.  All of these efforts resulted
      in a reduction of approximately 18% in the average roaming rate per minute
      paid to other carriers for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared with
      1998.

      Costs of equipment sales

          Costs of  equipment  sales for the year ended  December  31, 1999 were
      $1,266 million.  This was an increase of $266 million, or 26.6%,  compared
      with 1998.  This  increase was  primarily  the result of  increased  gross
      subscriber   additions  in  1999  compared  with  1998.  Gross  subscriber
      additions  increased 25.1% for the year ended 1999 compared with the prior
      year.

      Selling, general and administrative

          SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $2,663 million
      compared with $2,122  million for the year ended  December  31,1998.  This
      increase was due to higher marketing and selling costs associated with the
      increase in consolidated gross subscriber  additions in 1999 compared with
      1998, as well as the growth in customer care expenses  associated with the
      larger consolidated subscriber base.

      Depreciation and amortization

          Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31,
      1999 were $1,253  million,  an increase of $174  million,  or 16.1%.  This
      increase  primarily  resulted  from a larger  asset  base  and  additional
      amortization of goodwill and other purchased  intangibles  associated with
      the acquisition of Vanguard  Cellular.  Capital  expenditures for the year
      ended December 31, 1999 and 1998,  were $2,476 million and $1,136 million,
      respectively.

      Asset impairment and restructuring charges

          During the fourth quarter of 1999, AT&T Wireless Group recorded a $531
      million asset  impairment  charge  primarily  associated  with the planned
      disposal of wireless communications  equipment resulting from a program to
      increase capacity and operating efficiency of the wireless network.  Asset
      impairment and restructuring  charges for the year ended December 31, 1998
      were $120 million,  which  represented  the  write-down  of  unrecoverable
      assets associated with non-strategic businesses.

      Other income

          Other income for the year ended  December  31, 1999 was $122  million.
      Other income for the year ended  December 31, 1998 was $650  million.  The
      decrease  was due  primarily  to the pretax  gains on sales in 1998 of LIN
      Television  Corporation  of  $342  million,  SmarTone   Telecommunications
      Holdings Limited of $128 million and PriceCellular of $67 million.

      Interest expense

          Interest expense consists  primarily of interest on intercompany  debt
      due to AT&T.  Interest  was  charged at 7.25% per annum for the year ended
      December  31,  1999 and 7.75% per annum for the year  ended  December  31,
      1998.  Interest  expense  for the year ended  December  31,  1999 was $136
      million,  an increase of $16 million,  or 13.3%,  compared with 1998.  The
      increase was due to a higher level of average debt outstanding,  partially
      offset by the impact of the lower rate charged by AT&T in 1999.

      Provision (benefit) for income taxes

          The benefit for income taxes for the year ended  December 31, 1999 was
      $294  million,  compared  with a tax provision of $59 million for the year
      ended  December  31,  1998.  The  benefit  for  income  taxes  in 1999 was
      primarily  due to the pre-tax loss for the period  coupled with changes in
      the valuation  allowance  and other  estimates.  The effective  income tax
      rates for the years  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998,  were  43.2% and
      31.6%,  respectively.  The effective income tax rate for 1998 was impacted
      by the effect of state taxes, net of federal benefit, and the amortization
      of  intangibles,  partially  offset  by  the  effects  of  changes  in the
      valuation allowance and other estimates.

      Net equity earnings (losses) from investments

          Net equity earnings (losses) from investments,  net of tax, was a loss
      of $19  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999,  compared  with
      earnings of $36 million for 1998.  The decrease was  primarily a result of
      increased  losses  associated  with affiliate  investments.  Additionally,
      equity  losses  increased  in  1999  compared  with  1998  due  to  losses
      associated with financial commitments related to certain investments.

      Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T

          AT&T Wireless Group had $1.0 billion of preferred  stock held by AT&T,
      as of December  31, 1999 and 1998,  that paid  dividends  at 9% per annum.
      Dividend  requirements on this preferred stock for each of the years ended
      December  31, 1999 and 1998 were $56 million,  net of amounts  recorded in
      accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

               AT&T WIRELESS GROUP LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          The  continued   expansion  of  AT&T  Wireless   Group's  network  and
      footprint,  including  spectrum auctions,  and service offerings,  and the
      marketing and distribution of its products and services,  will continue to
      require substantial capital. AT&T Wireless Group has funded its operations
      by offering proceeds  attributed from AT&T,  intercompany  borrowings from
      AT&T and internally generated funds, as well as capital contributions from
      AT&T prior to the offering.  Capital  contributions from AT&T prior to the
      offering  included  acquisitions made by AT&T that have been attributed to
      AT&T  Wireless  Group.  Noncash  capital  contributions  from AT&T to AT&T
      Wireless Group related to acquisitions and initial  investments  funded by
      AT&T totaled $539 million,  $2,553 million, and $982 million for the years
      ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

          The April 2000 offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted
      in net proceeds to AT&T after deducting underwriter's discount and related
      fees and expenses of $10.3 billion.  AT&T  attributed  $7.0 billion of the
      net proceeds to AT&T Wireless  Group in the form of an  intercompany  note
      receivable,  which was repaid by December 31, 2000, and was used primarily
      to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.

          On  May  1,  2000,   following  the  offering,   AT&T  Wireless  Group
      recapitalized  $2.0 billion of outstanding  intercompany  indebtedness  to
      AT&T into an additional $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative preferred stock held
      by AT&T. In conjunction with the  recapitalization,  AT&T Wireless Group's
      long-term debt due to AT&T was  recapitalized to be 10 year term debt that
      bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% per annum.

          Currently, financing activities for AT&T Wireless Group are managed by
      AT&T on a centralized basis and are subject to the review of AT&T Wireless
      Group's  capital  stock  committee.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  capital  stock
      committee  is  selected  by  AT&T's  board of  directors  to  oversee  the
      interaction  between  businesses  of AT&T  Common  Stock  Group  and  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  in  accordance   with  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group  Policy
      Statement.  Under the AT&T Wireless Group Policy  Statement,  all material
      transactions  between AT&T Common Stock Group and AT&T Wireless  Group are
      determined  and  governed by a process of fair  dealing.  Sources for AT&T
      Wireless Group's future  financing  requirements may include the borrowing
      of funds,  including  additional  short-term  floating rate debt from AT&T
      and/or  third-party  debt.  Loans from AT&T to any member of AT&T Wireless
      Group have been made at interest  rates and on other terms and  conditions
      intended to be  substantially  equivalent to the interest  rates and other
      terms and conditions that AT&T Wireless Group would be able to obtain from
      third parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of AT&T
      without the benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy contemplates that
      these  loans will be made on the basis set forth above  regardless  of the
      interest  rates and  other  terms and  conditions  on which  AT&T may have
      acquired the funds. If, however,  AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order
      to keep  available  funds for use by AT&T  Wireless  Group,  those fees or
      charges will be allocated to AT&T Wireless Group.

          Our board of directors  has the power to make  determinations that may
      impact the financial and liquidity  position of each of the tracking stock
      groups.  This power  includes  the  ability to set  priorities  for use of
      capital and debt capacity,  to determine cash  management  policies and to
      make decisions  regarding  whether to make capital  expenditures and as to
      the timing  and amount of any  capital  expenditures.  All  actions by the
      board of directors  are subject to the board members  fiduciary  duties to
      all  shareholders  of AT&T  as a  group  and  not  just  to  holders  of a
      particular class of tracking stock and to our policy  statements,  by-laws
      and inter-company  agreements. As a result of this discretion of our board
      of  directors,  it may be difficult  for  investors to assess each group's
      liquidity and capital  resource needs and in turn the future  prospects of
      each group based on past performance.


          In association with the intended split-off of AT&T Wireless Group from
      AT&T announced on October 25, 2000, AT&T and AT&T Wireless Services,  Inc.
      anticipate  that  they  will  enter  into a  separation  and  distribution
      agreement  that will  govern the terms of the  split-off.  As part of this
      agreement,  AT&T  Wireless  Services  will agree,  upon  completion of the
      split-off,  to repay the full  amount of the  principal  and  accrued  but
      unpaid  interest or face value and accrued  but unpaid  dividends,  of all
      outstanding  indebtedness  owned by AT&T Wireless  Group to AT&T,  and all
      preferred stock in AT&T Wireless Group held by AT&T.

          On January 22, 2001,  AT&T closed their  transaction  with NTT DoCoMo.
      AT&T attributed  $6.2 billion of the approximate  $9.8 billion of proceeds
      received from DoComo to AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany
      note  receivable.  AT&T Wireless  Group intends to utilize the proceeds to
      continue executing their strategy to expand their capacity,  enlarge their
      footprint,  create  an  advanced  mobile  internet  and  invest  in  other
      strategic  growth  initiatives,   as  well  as  to  satisfy   intercompany
      obligations.

          On March 23, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless Group,  through AWS,  entered  into
      Competitive  Advance and Revolving Credit Facilities (the "Facilities") in
      the aggregate amount of $2.5 billion  consisting of an up to $1.25 billion
      364-day  Competitive  Advance and Revolving  Credit  Facility and an up to
      $1.25 billion Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility.
      The facilities are subject to a facility fee and  utilization fee and bear
      interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases,  LIBOR, the prime
      rate or the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions.  The Facilities
      may be used for general  corporate  purposes  and are subject to customary
      covenants,  representations  and  warranties  and  events of  default.  In
      addition,  the  Facilities  contain  financial  covenants  providing for a
      maximum  total debt to total  Consolidated  Operational  EBITDA  ratio (as
      defined  in the  facilities  agreement)  not to exceed 4:0 to 1:0 for AT&T
      Wireless Group and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5:1.0.  From the
      date of the closing of the  Facilities  until the date of the split-off of
      AT&T Wireless Group,  AWS will be prohibited from declaring  and/or paying
      dividends.  The Facility  also  specifies  limitations  on AT&T's and AT&T
      Wireless Group's ability to consummate the split-off including a provision
      that  it  will  constitute  an  event  of  default  if  the  split-off  is
      consummated  without  obtaining a favorable  tax ruling from the IRS or an
      unqualified  tax opinion  that the  split-off  will  qualify as a tax-free
      transaction.  In addition, the existence of an obligation by AT&T Wireless
      Group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  DoCoMo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.

          On March 1, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWS,  completed  a
      private placement of $6.5 billion in Senior Notes with maturity dates from
      2006 to 2031.  The notes pay  interest  at rates  ranging  from  7.350% to
      8.750% per annum,  and  include  customary  covenants.  The notes  include
      registration rights, such that AWS is required to exchange the notes for a
      new issue of notes  registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are to
      be declared effect no later than 240 days after the issue date.

          AT&T performs  cash  management  functions on behalf of  AT&T Wireless
      Group.  Substantially all of AT&T Wireless Group's cash balances are swept
      to AT&T on a daily  basis,  where they are managed  and  invested by AT&T.
      Prior to the offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,  transfers of
      cash to and from AT&T were reflected as a component of combined attributed
      net assets,  with no interest income or expense  reflected.  Subsequent to
      the offering,  transfers  are reflected as changes in the note  receivable
      from AT&T.  Cash balances  maintained  and reported by AT&T Wireless Group
      primarily represent cash balances for which no right of offset exists with
      AT&T.
<PAGE>
          Net cash provided by operating  activities for the year ended December
      31,  2000,  was $1,635  million,  compared  with $867 million for the year
      ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase in cash  provided by  operating
      activities was primarily due to an increase in operating  income excluding
      depreciation and amortization,  and the asset impairment and restructuring
      charge in 1999, resulting from revenue growth and expense leveraging,  and
      an increase in operating and payroll related accruals, partially offset by
      increases in inventories and accounts receivable.

          Net cash used in investing  activities for the year ended December 31,
      2000, was $10,525 million, compared with $2,123 million for the year ended
      December 31, 1999.  The  investing  activities  included on AT&T  Wireless
      Group's  statements of cash flows include cash expenditures or receipts of
      cash for  investing  transactions  directly  attributable  to the wireless
      group  operations,  and those legal  entities  that comprise the financial
      statements of AT&T Wireless  Group.  These amounts are  representative  of
      what AT&T Wireless Group would report on a stand-alone basis. The increase
      was due  primarily  to the  acquisitions  of wireless  systems in Houston,
      Indianapolis  and San Diego,  the Bay Area  Properties,  and Wireless One.
      Equity investment  purchases increased primarily due to the acquisition of
      equity  interests  in  international  ventures,   acquired  from  AT&T  in
      association  with their  acquisition  of MediaOne.  In  addition,  capital
      expenditures increased as a result of efforts to increase network capacity
      in existing markets as well as to expand the national footprint.

          Net cash  provided by financing  activities  for the year December 31,
      2000, was $8,947 million,  compared with $1,234 million for the year ended
      December 31, 1999.  The increase was primarily due to proceeds  attributed
      from the offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock,  short-term debt
      borrowed from AT&T as well as increased  transfers  from AT&T prior to the
      offering, to fund acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.

          Net cash provided by operating  activities for the year ended December
      31, 1999 was $867 million  compared  with $414 million of cash provided by
      operating  activities in 1998 primarily due to increased  operating income
      excluding  depreciation  and  amortization,  and the asset  impairment and
      restructuring  charges and larger  increases  in  operating  accruals  and
      accounts  payable.  These  increases  were offset by a higher  increase in
      accounts  receivable  driven by strong  revenue  growth.  Net cash used in
      investing  activities  for the year  ended  December  31,1999  was  $2,123
      million,  compared  with  $238  million  of  cash  provided  by  investing
      activities in 1998.  The  difference  was due primarily to higher  capital
      expenditures to upgrade and increase  capacity in existing markets as well
      as to expand the national  footprint,  and lower cash proceeds  associated
      with the sales of  equity  investments.  Net cash  provided  by  financing
      activities  for the  year  ended  December  31,  1999 was  $1,234  million
      compared  with $631 million of cash used in financing  activities  in 1998
      due to increased transfers and debt financing from AT&T to fund the higher
      capital expenditures during 1999.

          EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest and taxes, excluding other
      income, plus depreciation and amortization, is the primary measure used by
      the chief  operating  decision-makers  to measure  our ability to generate
      cash flow.  EBITDA may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation  of
      EBITDA for other public companies and should not be viewed by investors as
      an alternative to generally accepted  accounting  principles,  measures of
      performance  or to cash  flows from  operating,  investing  and  financing
      activities as a measure of liquidity.
<PAGE>
          EBITDA for the year  ended  December  31,  2000,  was $1,648  million,
      compared  with $587 million for the year ended  December  31, 1999.  On an
      operational  basis,  adjusted  to exclude  the 1999 asset  impairment  and
      restructuring  charge of $531 million,  EBITDA  increased  $530 million or
      47.3%.  The increase was primarily the result of revenue  growth and lower
      off-network  roaming  expenses.  These increases were partially  offset by
      increased customer acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross
      subscriber  additions,  increased network costs attributable to the growth
      in  subscribers  and  their  minutes  of use,  and  increased  information
      technology  and  customer  care  related  costs to  support  growth in the
      subscriber base.

          For our  mobility  business,  EBITDA for the year ended  December  31,
      2000,  was $1,884  million,  compared with $670 million for the year ended
      December 31, 1999.  Excluding the 1999 asset impairment and  restructuring
      charge, mobility EBITDA increased $686 million or 57.2%.

          For our fixed  wireless  business,  EBITDA for the year ended December
      31, 2000,  was a deficit of $228  million,  compared with a deficit of $75
      million  the year  ended  December  31,  1999.  Excluding  the 1999  asset
      impairment and restructuring  charge, fixed wireless EBITDA decreased $156
      million or 213.4%.

          EBITDA  margins  were  15.8% for the year  ended  December  31,  2000,
      compared with 14.7% for the year and December 31, 1999, excluding the 1999
      asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charge.  The  improvement in EBITDA
      margins for the year ended  December 31, 2000,  compared to the year ended
      December  31, 1999,  was  primarily  driven by revenue  growth and expense
      leveraging,  primarily  off-network roaming expenses,  partially offset by
      increased  customer  acquisition  and customer care costs  associated with
      growth in the subscriber base.

          EBITDA margins for our mobility business were 18.0% for the year ended
      December 31,  2000,  compared  with 15.7% for the year ended  December 31,
      1999, excluding the 1999 asset impairment and restructuring charge.

          EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $587 million  compared
      with $736 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.  Excluding  pretax
      asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges of $531 million in 1999 and
      $120  million  in  1998,   EBITDA  was  $1,118  million  for  1999,  which
      represented  an increase of $262  million,  or 30.6%,  compared with 1998.
      This  increase  was  attributable  to  increases  in total  revenue and an
      improving margin as SG&A expenses declined as a percentage of revenue.

          For our  mobility  business,  EBITDA for the year ended  December  31,
      1999,  was $670  million,  compared  with $794  million for the year ended
      December 31, 1998.  Excluding  pretax asset  impairment and  restructuring
      charges  of $528  million  in 1999 and $120  million  in 1998,  EBITDA was
      $1,198 million for 1999 compared with $914 million for 1998.

          Excluding   the   aforementioned    pretax   asset   impairment    and
      restructuring  charges in 1999 and 1998, EBITDA margins were 14.7% for the
      year ended December 31, 1999,  compared with 15.8% in 1998. The decline in
      EBITDA  margins  in 1999  compared  with  1998  was  driven  primarily  by
      increased  roaming  expenses,  as well as  increased  sales and  marketing
      expenses associated with a 25.1% increase in gross consolidated subscriber
      additions in 1999 compared with 1998.

          Excluding the aforementioned pretax asset impairment and restructuring
      charges in 1999 and 1998,  EBITDA  margins for our mobility  business were
      15.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1999,  compared  with 16.9% for the
      year ended December 31, 1998.

                     AT&T WIRELESS GROUP FINANCIAL CONDITION

          Total assets were $35,302 million as of December 31, 2000, an increase
      of $11,790  million,  or 50.1%,  compared  with  December  31,  1999.  The
      increase was due primarily to increases in licensing costs,  goodwill, and
      property,  plant and equipment  associated with the acquisitions closed in
      2000,  including  the  acquisitions  of Wireless  One,  L.P. and  wireless
      systems in the San Francisco Bay Area,  San Diego,  Indianapolis,  Houston
      and Los  Angeles.  In  addition,  the  increase  in  property,  plant  and
      equipment was a result of significant  capital  expenditures  for the year
      ended  December 31,  2000.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by a
      decrease in  investments  as AT&T Wireless  Group  previously  held equity
      interests  in  portions  of the Bay Area  Properties,  and the Los Angeles
      market,  through  their  interest  in  AB  Cellular.  These  markets  were
      consolidated as of December 31, 2000.

          Total  liabilities  were  $10,384  million as of December  31, 2000, a
      increase of $889 million,  or 9.4%,  compared with December 31, 1999.  The
      increase was  primarily  due to  increases  in deferred  income taxes as a
      result of gains recorded during the fourth  quarter,  as well as increased
      marketing, business tax and other operating accruals. These increases were
      partially offset by a net decrease in intercompany indebtedness to AT&T.

          Combined  attributed net assets was $24,887 million as of December 31,
      2000, an increase of $10,880 million, or 77.7%, compared with December 31,
      1999.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to the  attribution  of offering
      proceeds to AT&T  Wireless  Group,  net  transfers  from AT&T prior to the
      offering  to  fund  capital  expansion  and  acquisitions,  as well as the
      additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock issued to AT&T.

              AT&T WIRELESS GROUP RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

          In September  2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
      issued SFAS No. 140,  "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
      Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities--A Replacement of FASB No. 125".
      This statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
      and  servicing of financial  assets and  extinguishments  of  liabilities.
      Under these  standards,  after a transfer of financial  assets,  an entity
      recognizes  the  financial  and  servicing  assets  it  controls  and  the
      liabilities it has incurred,  derecognizes  financial  assets when control
      has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. This
      statement provides  consistent  standards for distinguishing  transfers of
      financial   assets  that  are  sales  from   transfers  that  are  secured
      borrowings.  This  statement is effective  for  transfers and servicing of
      financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring after March
      31, 2001.  AT&T  Wireless  Group does not expect that the adoption of SFAS
      No.  140  will  have a  material  impact  on its  results  of  operations,
      financial position or cash flows.

          In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities".  Among other provisions,  it requires
      that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in
      the statement of financial  position and measure those instruments at fair
      value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those
      derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative
      and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date of this
      standard was delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The effective  date
      for SFAS No. 133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15, 2000,
      though  earlier  adoption is encouraged  and  retroactive  application  is
      prohibited.  For AT&T Wireless Group, this means that the standard must be
      adopted no later than January 1, 2001. In June 2000,  the FASB issued SFAS
      No.  138,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain
      Hedging  Activities"  as an  amendment  to SFAS No.  133.  This  statement
      provides clarification with regard to certain
<PAGE>
      implementation  issues under SFAS No. 133 on specific types of hedges. The
      adoption of SFAS No. 133 in January 2001,  did not have a material  impact
      to the AT&T Wireless Group's results of operations,  financial position or
      cash flows.  In  addition,  based on the types of  contracts  we currently
      have, AT&T Wireless Group does not anticipate that this standard will have
      a material impact on future results of AT&T Wireless Group.

                      AT&T WIRELESS GROUP SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

          In January 2001, AT&T Wireless Group executed  agreements with certain
      network   equipment   vendors,   related   to  the   development   of  its
      next-generation  network strategy.  These agreements require AT&T Wireless
      Group to buy equipment  from these  vendors  totaling  approximately  $1.8
      billion through 2004.

          Effective January 1, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group implemented the results
      of  a  review  of  the  estimated   service  lives  of  certain   wireless
      communications equipment,  primarily electronics.  Lives were shortened to
      fully depreciate all such equipment within seven years.  Similar equipment
      acquired  after  January 1, 2001,  will have  useful  lives no longer than
      seven years.

          On January 22, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS,  completed its
      previously  announced  transaction  with  DoCoMo.  See Note 1 for  further
      discussion of the transaction.

          On November 17, 2000,  AT&T Wireless Group announced that AT&T's board
      of directors  had approved an agreement  under which AT&T  Wireless  Group
      would   purchase   $200  in  Series  AA   preferred   stock  from   Dobson
      Communications  Corporation.  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, completed
      this  transaction  on  February  8, 2001.  The Series AA  preferred  stock
      acquired  has  a  liquidation  preference  of  $1,000  per  share  and  is
      exchangeable  into Series A convertible  preferred stock. If the Series AA
      preferred  stock is exchanged into Series A convertible  preferred  stock,
      AT&T Wireless Group will increase its ownership  interest in Dobson, on an
      as converted to common stock basis,  from its current ownership of 4.6% to
      approximately 11.6%.

          On March 23, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through AWS,  entered into
      Competitive  Advance and Revolving Credit Facilities (the "Facilities") in
      the aggregate amount of $2.5 billion consisting of and up to $1.25 billion
      364-day  Competitive  Advance and Revolving  Credit  Facility and an up to
      $1.25 billion Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility.
      The facilities are subject to a facility fee and  utilization fee and bear
      interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases,  LIBOR, the prime
      rate or the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions.  The Facilities
      may be used for general  corporate  purposes  and are subject to customary
      covenants,  representations  and  warranties  and  events of  default.  In
      addition,  the  Facilities  contain  financial  covenants  providing for a
      maximum  total debt to total  Consolidated  Operational  EBITDA  ratio (as
      defined  in the  facilities  agreement)  not to exceed 4:0 to 1:0 for AT&T
      Wireless Group and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5:1.0.  From the
      date of the closing of the  Facilities  until the date of the split-off of
      AT&T Wireless Group,  AWS will be prohibited from declaring  and/or paying
      dividends.  The Facility  also  specifies  limitations  on AT&T's and AT&T
      Wireless Group's ability to consummate the split-off including a provision
      that  it  will  constitute  an  event  of  default  if  the  split-off  is
      consummated  without  obtaining a favorable  tax ruling from the IRS or an
      unqualified  tax opinion  that the  split-off  will  qualify as a tax-free
      transaction.  In addition, the existence of an obligation by AT&T Wireless
      Group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  DoCoMo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.
<PAGE>
          On February 26, 2001, AT&T agreed to sell its entire interest in Japan
      Telecom for approximately  $1.35 billion.  The net after-tax  proceeds are
      expected to be approximately  $1 billion.  AT&T has indicated that the net
      after-tax  proceeds  will be split evenly  between AT&T and AT&T  Wireless
      Group.   AT&T  Wireless  Group   anticipates  that  it  will  recognize  a
      significant gain on the transaction.

          On March 1, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWS,  completed  a
      private placement of $6.5 billion in Senior Notes with maturity dates from
      2006 to 2031.  The notes pay  interest  at rates  ranging  from  7.350% to
      8.750% per annum,  and  include  customary  covenants.  The notes  include
      registration rights, such that AWS is required to exchange the notes for a
      new issue of notes  registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are to
      be declared effect no later than 240 days after the issue date.


ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.


         REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

         Management  is   responsible   for  the   preparation,   integrity  and
objectivity of the  consolidated  financial  statements and all other  financial
information  included  in  this  report.  Management  is  also  responsible  for
maintaining a system of internal  controls as a fundamental  requirement for the
operational and financial integrity of results. The financial statements,  which
reflect the  consolidated  accounts of AT&T Corp.  and  subsidiaries  (AT&T) and
other financial  information  shown,  were prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting  principles.  Estimates included in the financial statements
were based on  judgments  of  qualified  personnel.  To  maintain  its system of
internal  controls,  management  carefully selects key personnel and establishes
the   organizational   structure   to  provide  an   appropriate   division   of
responsibility.  We  believe it is  essential  to  conduct  business  affairs in
accordance with the highest  ethical  standards as set forth in the AT&T Code of
Conduct. These guidelines and other informational programs are designed and used
to ensure that  policies,  standards and managerial  authorities  are understood
throughout the organization.  Our internal auditors monitor  compliance with the
system of internal controls by means of an annual plan of internal audits. On an
ongoing  basis,  the system of internal  controls  is  reviewed,  evaluated  and
revised as necessary in light of the results of constant  management  oversight,
internal  and  independent   audits,   changes  in  AT&T's  business  and  other
conditions. Management believes that the system of internal controls, taken as a
whole, provides reasonable assurance that (1) financial records are adequate and
can be  relied  upon to  permit  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and (2) access to
assets occurs only in accordance with management's authorizations.

         The Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors,  which is composed of
directors  who  are not  employees,  meets  periodically  with  management,  the
internal auditors and the independent  accountants to review the manner in which
these groups of individuals are performing their  responsibilities  and to carry
out the Audit  Committee's  oversight  role with respect to  auditing,  internal
controls  and  financial  reporting  matters.  Periodically,  both the  internal
auditors and the independent accountants meet privately with the Audit Committee
and have access to its individual members at any time.

         The consolidated  financial  statements in this annual report have been
audited by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, Independent  Accountants.  Their audits
were conducted in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards and
include an assessment of the internal  control  structure and selective tests of
transactions. Their report follows.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of AT&T Corp.:

         In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of other  auditors,
the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and the  related  consolidated
statements of income,  changes in shareowners'  equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of AT&T Corp. and its
subsidiaries  (AT&T) at  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years ended  December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States.  These financial statements are the responsibility of AT&T's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Liberty Media Group,
an equity method investee,  which was acquired by AT&T on March 9, 1999.  AT&T's
financial  statements  include an  investment  of $34,290  million  and  $38,460
million as of  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and  equity  method
earnings  (losses) of $1,488 million and $(2,022)  million,  for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Those statements were audited by other
auditors  whose  report  thereon  has  been  furnished  to us,  and our  opinion
expressed  herein,  insofar as it relates to the  amounts  included  for Liberty
Media Group,  as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, is based
solely on the report of the other  auditors.  We  conducted  our audits of these
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States,  which  require  that we plan and  perform  the  audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits  and the  report of other  auditors  provide a  reasonable  basis for the
opinion expressed above.

 AT&T CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES (AT&T) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
      Dollars in millions unless otherwise noted (except per share amounts)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION

         The   consolidated   financial   statements   include  all   controlled
subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in majority-owned  subsidiaries  where
control  does  not  exist  and  investments  in which  we  exercise  significant
influence  but do not control  (generally a 20% to 50%  ownership  interest) are
accounted  for under  the  equity  method of  accounting.  This  represents  the
majority  of our  investments.  Investments  in  which we have  less  than a 20%
ownership interest and in which there is no significant  influence are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

         For  operations  outside  the  United  States  that  prepare  financial
statements  in  currencies  other  than the U.S.  dollar,  we  translate  income
statement  amounts  at average  exchange  rates for the year,  and we  translate
assets and liabilities at year-end  exchange rates. We present these translation
adjustments  as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income within
shareowners'  equity.  Gains and losses from foreign  currency  transactions are
included in results of operations.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

         We recognize long distance,  local and wireless  services revenue based
upon  minutes  of  traffic   processed  or  contracted  fee   schedules.   Cable
installation  revenue is recognized in the period the installation  services are
provided to the extent of direct selling costs. Any remaining amount is deferred
and recognized over the estimated  average period that customers are expected to
remain connected to the cable distribution  systems.  Customer  activation fees,
along with the related  costs,  are  deferred  and  amortized  over the customer
relationship  period. The revenue and related expenses  associated with the sale
of wireless  handsets  and  accessories  are  recognized  when the  products are
delivered  and accepted by  customers,  as this is  considered  to be a separate
earnings process from the sale of wireless services. We recognize other products
and services  revenue when the products are  delivered and accepted by customers
and when services are provided in accordance with contract  terms.  During 2000,
we adopted  Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting  Bulletin
No. 101,  "Revenue  Recognition in Financial  Statements".  The adoption did not
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS

         We  expense  costs  of  advertising  and  promotions,   including  cash
incentives used to acquire customers,  as incurred.  Advertising and promotional
expenses were $1,995, $1,804 and $1,920 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Of
these amounts,  $288, $320 and $622 were cash incentives to acquire customers in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS

         We amortize  investment tax credits as a reduction to the provision for
income taxes over the useful lives of the assets that produced the credits.
<PAGE>

CASH EQUIVALENTS

         We consider all highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of
generally three months or less to be cash equivalents.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

         We  state   property,   plant  and  equipment  at  cost  and  determine
depreciation  based upon the assets'  estimated  useful  lives using  either the
group or unit method.  The useful lives of communications  and network equipment
range from three to 15 years.  The useful lives of other  equipment  ranges from
three to seven years. The useful lives of buildings and improvements  range from
10 to 40 years. The group method is used for most depreciable assets,  including
the majority of  communications  and network  equipment.  When we sell or retire
assets  depreciated using the group method,  the cost is deducted from property,
plant and equipment and charged to accumulated depreciation, without recognition
of a gain or loss. The unit method is primarily used for large computer  systems
and support  assets.  When we sell assets that were  depreciated  using the unit
method, we include the related gains or losses in other income.

         We  use  accelerated   depreciation   methods   primarily  for  certain
high-technology  computer-processing equipment and digital equipment used in the
telecommunications  network,  except for switching  equipment  placed in service
before  1989,  where a  straight-line  method  is  used.  All  other  plant  and
equipment,  including  capitalized  software,  is depreciated on a straight-line
basis.

LICENSING COSTS

         Licensing  costs are costs  incurred to acquire  cellular  and personal
communications   services   (PCS)   licenses.   Amortization   begins  with  the
commencement  of service to customers  and is computed  using the  straight-line
method over periods of 35 or 40 years.

FRANCHISE COSTS

         Franchise  costs include the value  attributed to agreements with local
authorities  that  allow  access to homes in cable  service  areas  acquired  in
connection  with  business  combinations.   Such  amounts  are  amortized  on  a
straight-line basis over 40 years.

GOODWILL

         Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
assets  acquired  in  business  combinations  accounted  for under the  purchase
method.  We  amortize  goodwill  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  periods
benefited, ranging from five to 40 years.

SOFTWARE CAPITALIZATION

         Certain direct development costs associated with internal-use  software
are capitalized,  including external direct costs of material and services,  and
payroll costs for employees devoting time to the software projects.  These costs
are included  within other assets and are amortized  over a period not to exceed
five  years  beginning  when the asset is  substantially  ready  for use.  Costs
incurred  during the  preliminary  project  stage,  as well as  maintenance  and
training  costs,  are  expensed  as  incurred.  AT&T  also  capitalizes  initial
operating-system  software  costs  and  amortizes  them  over  the  life  of the
associated hardware.
<PAGE>

         AT&T  also  capitalizes   costs  associated  with  the  development  of
application  software  incurred  from  the  time  technological  feasibility  is
established  until the software is ready to provide service to customers.  These
capitalized  costs  are  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  and are
amortized over a useful life not to exceed five years.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

         Long-lived  assets,  such as property,  plant and equipment,  licensing
costs,  franchise costs,  goodwill,  investments and software,  are reviewed for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying  amount may not be  recoverable.  If the total of the  expected  future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is
recognized for the  difference  between the fair value and carrying value of the
asset. In addition, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 17, "Intangible Assets", we continue to evaluate the amortization periods to
determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised amortization periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         We use various financial  instruments,  including  derivative financial
instruments, for purposes other than trading. We do not use derivative financial
instruments  for  speculative  purposes.   Derivatives,  used  as  part  of  our
risk-management  strategy,  must be  designated  at  inception  as a  hedge  and
measured for effectiveness  both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Gains and
losses related to qualifying  hedges of foreign  currency firm  commitments  are
deferred  in  current  assets  or  liabilities  and  recognized  as  part of the
underlying  transactions as they occur. All other foreign exchange contracts are
marked to market on a current  basis,  and the  respective  gains or losses  are
recognized in other income. Interest rate differentials associated with interest
rate swaps used to hedge AT&T's debt  obligations  are recorded as an adjustment
to interest payable or receivable,  with the offset to interest expense over the
life of the swaps. If we terminate an interest rate swap agreement,  the gain or
loss is deferred and amortized over the remaining  life of the  liability.  Cash
flows from financial  instruments are classified in the Consolidated  Statements
of Cash Flows  under the same  categories  as the cash  flows  from the  related
assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions.

USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements,  and revenue and expenses during the period reported. Actual results
could  differ  from those  estimates.  Estimates  are used when  accounting  for
certain  items such as long-term  contracts,  allowance  for doubtful  accounts,
depreciation  and  amortization,  employee benefit plans,  taxes,  restructuring
reserves and contingencies.

CONCENTRATIONS

         As of December 31, 2000, we do not have any  significant  concentration
of  business  transacted  with a  particular  customer,  supplier or lender that
could, if suddenly  eliminated,  severely impact our operations.  We also do not
have a concentration of available  sources of labor,  services,  franchises,  or
licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact our
operations. We invest our cash with several high-quality credit institutions.
<PAGE>

ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK BY AFFILIATES

         Changes  in our  proportionate  share  of the  underlying  equity  of a
subsidiary  or  equity  method  investee,  which  result  from the  issuance  of
additional  equity  securities  by such entity,  are  recognized as increases or
decreases  to  additional  paid-in  capital in the  Consolidated  Statements  of
Shareowners' Equity.

RECLASSIFICATIONS AND RESTATEMENTS

         We  reclassified  certain  amounts for previous years to conform to the
2000  presentation.  In  addition,  we  restated  prior year share and per share
amounts to reflect the June 2000 two-for-one split of Liberty Media Group common
stock.

2.  RESTRUCTURING OF AT&T

         On October 25, 2000,  we  announced a  restructuring  plan  designed to
fully  separate  or issue  separately  tracked  stocks  intended  to reflect the
financial  performance and economic value of each of AT&T's four major operating
units. Upon completion of the plan, AT&T Wireless, AT&T Broadband, AT&T Business
and AT&T Consumer will all be represented by asset-based or tracking stocks.

         As part of the first phase of the  restructuring  plan, we are planning
an exchange offer that will give AT&T  shareowners  the  opportunity to exchange
any  portion of their AT&T  common  shares  for  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking stock, subject to pro-ration.  Following the exchange offer and subject
to specified conditions,  AT&T plans to split-off AT&T Wireless Group from AT&T.
We intend,  however,  to retain up to $3 billion of shares of AT&T  Wireless for
future sale, exchange or monetization within six months following the split-off.
We expect AT&T Wireless  will become an  independent,  publicly-held  company in
mid-2001, upon receipt of appropriate tax and other approvals.

         In  addition  to the  split-off  of AT&T  Wireless,  we intend to fully
separate or issue separate tracking stocks to reflect the financial  performance
and economic value of each of our other major business  units. We plan to create
and issue new classes of stock to track the financial  performance  and economic
value of our AT&T  Broadband  unit and AT&T Consumer  unit. We plan to sell some
percentage of shares of the AT&T Broadband  unit in the fall of 2001.  Within 12
months of such sale, we intend to completely  separate AT&T Broadband from AT&T,
as an  asset-based  stock.  The AT&T Consumer  tracking  stock is expected to be
fully distributed to AT&T shareowners in the second half of 2001.

         AT&T  expects  that  these   transactions  will  be  tax-free  to  U.S.
shareholders.   AT&T's   restructuring   plan  is  complicated  and  involves  a
substantial  number  of steps  and  transactions,  including  obtaining  various
conditions,  such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. In addition, future
financial conditions,  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur
that make it  inadvisable  to proceed  with part or all of AT&T's  restructuring
plans. Any or all of the elements of AT&T's  restructuring plan may not occur as
we currently  expect or in the timeframes that we currently  contemplate,  or at
all.  Alternative forms of restructuring,  including sales of interests in these
businesses,  would reduce what is available for  distribution  to shareowners in
the restructuring.

         On November 15, 2000,  AT&T announced that our board of directors voted
to  split-off  Liberty  Media  Group  (LMG),   which  we  acquired  through  our
acquisition  of  Tele-Communications,  Inc. A new  asset-based  security will be
issued to holders  of LMG  tracking  stock in  exchange  for their LMG  tracking
shares.  The split-off remains subject to receipt of a favorable tax ruling from
the IRS. We expect this split-off to be completed in mid-2001.

4.  MERGERS WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC. AND TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, INC.



MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC.

         On June 15, 2000,  AT&T  completed a merger with MediaOne  Group,  Inc.
(MediaOne) in a cash and stock transaction  valued at approximately $45 billion.
For  each  share  of  MediaOne  stock,  MediaOne  shareowners  received,  in the
aggregate,  0.95 of a share of AT&T  common  stock and $36.27 per share in cash,
consisting of $30.85 per share as  stipulated in the merger  agreement and $5.42
per share based on AT&T's stock price  preceding  the merger,  which was below a
predetermined  amount.  AT&T issued  approximately  603 million shares of common
stock in the  transaction,  of which  approximately  60  million  were  treasury
shares.  The AT&T shares had an  aggregate  market  value of  approximately  $21
billion and cash payments totaled approximately $24 billion.

         The merger was  accounted for under the purchase  method.  Accordingly,
the results of MediaOne  have been  included  in the  accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements  since the date of  acquisition  as part of our  Broadband
segment.

         Approximately $16 billion of the purchase price of $45 billion has been
attributed to agreements with local franchise  authorities  that allow access to
homes in our broadband service areas ("franchise  costs") and is being amortized
on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. Also included in the purchase price was
approximately  $22 billion  related to  nonconsolidated  investments,  including
investments in Time Warner Entertainment  Company, L.P. (TWE) and Vodafone Group
plc  (Vodafone),  approximately  $5  billion  related  to  property,  plant  and
equipment,  and  approximately  $7 billion  of other net  assets.  In  addition,
included  was  approximately   $14  billion  in  deferred  income   liabilities,
approximately  $10 billion  attributable to MediaOne debt, and  approximately $1
billion of minority  interest in Centaur  Funding  Corporation,  a subsidiary of
MediaOne.  The purchase  resulted in preliminary  goodwill of approximately  $20
billion,  which is being amortized on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. AT&T
may make  refinements  to the allocation of the purchase price in future periods
as the related  fair value  appraisals  of certain  assets and  liabilities  are
finalized.
<PAGE>

MERGER WITH TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

         On March 9, 1999,  AT&T  completed a merger  with  Tele-Communications,
Inc.  (TCI),  renamed  AT&T  Broadband,  in an all-stock  transaction  valued at
approximately  $52  billion.  Each share of TCI Group  Series A common stock was
converted into 1.16355 shares of AT&T common stock,  and each share of TCI Group
Series B common stock was  converted  into 1.27995  shares of AT&T common stock.
AT&T issued approximately 664 million shares of common stock in the transaction,
of which  approximately 149 million were treasury shares. The AT&T shares had an
aggregate market value of approximately $27 billion. Certain subsidiaries of TCI
held TCI Group  Series A common  stock,  which was  converted  into 216  million
shares of AT&T common stock. These  subsidiaries  continue to hold these shares,
which are reflected as treasury stock in the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets.

         In  addition,  TCI  simultaneously  combined  its  Liberty  Media Group
programming business with its TCI Ventures Group technology investment business,
forming LMG. In connection with the closing, AT&T issued separate tracking stock
in exchange  for the TCI Liberty  Media Group and TCI  Ventures  Group  tracking
shares previously  outstanding.  We issued 2,280 million shares of Liberty Media
Group  Class A tracking  stock  (including  120  million  shares  related to the
conversion of  convertible  notes) and 220 million shares of Liberty Media Group
Class B tracking  stock.  The tracking stock is designed to reflect the separate
financial  performance  and economic value of LMG. These shares had an aggregate
market value of approximately $23 billion.

         AT&T  does not have a  controlling  financial  interest  for  financial
accounting purposes in LMG. Therefore,  our investment in LMG has been reflected
as an  investment  accounted  for under the  equity  method in the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG are reflected
as "Equity  earnings  (losses)  from  Liberty  Media Group" and  "Investment  in
Liberty  Media  Group  and  related   receivables,   net"  in  the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements.  As a separate  tracking stock,  all of the
earnings or losses  related to LMG are excluded  from the earnings  available to
the holders of AT&T common stock.

         Each share of Liberty  Media Group Class A common  stock is entitled to
0.0375 of a vote,  and each share of Liberty Media Group Class B common stock is
entitled to 0.375 of a vote.

         The  TCI  merger  was   accounted   for  under  the  purchase   method.
Accordingly,  the results of TCI have been included in the financial  results of
AT&T  since the date of  acquisition.  The  operating  results  of TCI have been
included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements at their fair
value  since  March 1,  1999,  the  deemed  effective  date of  acquisition  for
accounting  purposes.  The impact of the results  from March 1 through  March 9,
1999, were deemed immaterial to our consolidated results.

         Approximately  $20  billion of the  purchase  price of $52  billion was
attributed to franchise costs and is being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis
over 40 years.  Pursuant to Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS)
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," AT&T recorded an approximate $13 billion
deferred tax liability in connection  with this franchise  intangible,  which is
also  included  in  franchise  costs.  We do not expect that this  deferred  tax
liability will ever be paid. This deferred tax liability is being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years and is included in the  provision  for income
taxes. Also included was  approximately  $11 billion related to  nonconsolidated
investments,  approximately $5 billion related to property, plant and equipment,

<PAGE>

approximately  $11 billion of TCI long-term  debt and  approximately  $7 billion
related  to other  net  liabilities.  In  addition,  our  investment  in LMG was
recorded at approximately  $34 billion,  including  approximately $11 billion of
goodwill  that is being  amortized on a straight-  line basis over 20 years as a
component of "Equity earnings (losses) from Liberty Media Group."

         Following  is a  summary  of the pro  forma  results  of AT&T as if the
mergers with MediaOne and TCI had closed effective January 1, 1999:

5.       OTHER  MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, STOCK OFFERING, VENTURE, DISPOSITIONS AND
         DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS


AB CELLULAR

         On December 29, 2000, AB Cellular  completed  the  redemption of AT&T's
equity  interest in AB Cellular.  Prior to that date,  AT&T held a 55.62% equity
interest  in AB  Cellular,  which was formed in 1998 with  BellSouth,  with each
party having a 50% voting interest. AB Cellular owned, controlled and supervised
wireless properties in Los Angeles,  Houston,  and Galveston,  Texas.  BellSouth
exercised an option  available to it,  which  resulted in AB Cellular  redeeming
AT&T's interest in AB Cellular in exchange for 100% of the net assets of the Los
Angeles property.  AB Cellular  recognized a significant gain upon completion of
the transaction.  Accordingly, net losses from other equity investments included
$603  representing  our portion of this gain,  and other  income  included a net
pretax loss of $184 related to the difference  between the carrying value of our
investment in AB Cellular and the fair market value of the Los Angeles property.
As a result of this transaction,  we consolidated the Los Angeles property.  The
consolidation  resulted in  licensing  costs of $2.2  billion,  goodwill of $0.8
billion,  other net assets of $0.6 billion and the removal of our  investment in
AB Cellular of $3.8 billion.
<PAGE>

TELECORP PCS, INC.

         On November 13, 2000, two of AT&T's wireless affiliates,  TeleCorp PCS,
Inc.  (TeleCorp) and Tritel,  Inc.,  merged as part of a stock  transaction.  In
connection  with the merger,  AT&T  contributed  to  TeleCorp  rights to acquire
wireless  licenses in Wisconsin  and Iowa,  paid  approximately  $20 in cash and
extended the term of its brand license  agreement through July 2005, in exchange
for  approximately  9.3 million  additional  common  shares in the newly  merged
entity. In a separate  transaction,  AT&T exchanged certain additional  wireless
licenses and rights to acquire  licenses in the Wisconsin and Iowa markets,  and
made a cash payment of  approximately  $80 for certain TeleCorp PCS licenses and
wireless systems in several New England markets.  These transactions resulted in
a net pretax gain of $379. The acquisition of the wireless systems was accounted
for under the purchase  method.  The pro forma impact of the wireless systems on
historical AT&T results is not material.

AT HOME CORPORATION

         On  August  28,  2000,  AT&T  and  At  Home  Corporation  (Excite@Home)
announced  shareholder  approval  of a new  board of  directors  and  governance
structure  for  Excite@Home  and  completion  of the  extension of  distribution
contracts with AT&T,  Cox  Communications,  Inc.  (Cox) and Comcast  Corporation
(Comcast). AT&T was given the right to designate six of the 11 Excite@Home board
members. In addition,  Excite@Home converted  approximately 50 million of AT&T's
Series A shares into Series B shares, each of which has 10 votes. As a result of
these  governance  changes,   AT&T  gained  a  controlling  interest  and  began
consolidating  Excite@Home's  results  upon the  closing of the  transaction  on
September 1, 2000. As of December 31, 2000,  AT&T had, on a fully diluted basis,
approximately  23% of the economic  interest  and 74% of the voting  interest in
Excite@Home.

         In exchange  for Cox and Comcast  relinquishing  their rights under the
shareholder agreement, AT&T granted put options to Cox and Comcast on a combined
total of 60.4  million  shares of  Excite@Home  Series A common  stock.  The put
options  provide Cox and  Comcast  with the right to convert  their  Excite@Home
shares  into  either  AT&T stock or cash at their  option,  at any time  between
January 1, 2001 and June 4, 2002, at the higher of (i) $48 per share or (ii) the
30-day average trading price at the time of exercise  (beginning 15 trading days
prior to the exercise  date,  and ending 15 days after the exercise  date).  The
maximum  amount  that  AT&T  would  be  required  to pay in  cash  or  stock  is
approximately  $2.9 billion based on the $48 strike price.  The obligation under
these put options was  recorded  at fair value,  with gains or losses  resulting
from changes in fair value being  recorded as a component of other  income.  For
the year,  changes in fair market  value  resulted in a pretax  expense of $537.
Subsequent to December 31, 2000,  Cox and Comcast  exercised  their put options,
electing to receive AT&T common shares (see Note 23).

         Also,  in  connection  with the  distribution  agreements  which extend
through 2008, AT&T obtained the right to purchase up to approximately 25 million
Excite@Home Series A shares and 25 million Series B shares. In addition, Cox and
Comcast  will each receive new warrants to purchase two Series A shares for each
home its cable system passes. These warrants will vest in installments every six
months  beginning in June 2001, and will be fully vested by June 2006 if Cox and
Comcast elect to continue their extended non-exclusive  distribution  agreements
through that period.

         The  consolidation  of  Excite@Home  resulted in  minority  interest of
approximately $2.2 billion,  goodwill of approximately $2.4 billion,  short-term
liabilities  of  approximately  $2.4  billion  (including  an initial put option
liability),  other net assets of  approximately  $1.2 billion and the removal of
our investment in Excite@Home of approximately $1.9 billion.

AT&T WIRELESS GROUP

         On April 27, 2000,  AT&T  created a new class of stock and  completed a
public stock offering of 360 million  shares,  which  represented  15.6% of AT&T
Wireless  Group  tracking  stock at a price of $29.50 per  share.  This stock is
intended  to track  the  financial  performance  and  economic  value of  AT&T's
wireless  services'   business.   The  net  proceeds  to  AT&T  after  deducting
underwriter's  discount and related fees and expenses were $10.3  billion.  AT&T
allocated  $7.0 billion of the net proceeds to AT&T Wireless  Group,  which were
used for acquisitions,  network expansion,  capital expenditures and for general
corporate purposes.  The remaining net proceeds of $3.3 billion were utilized by
AT&T for general  corporate  purposes.  Holders of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking
stock are  entitled  to one-half of a vote per share.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group
tracking stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AWE."

COX COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

         On March 15, 2000,  AT&T  received  50.3 million  shares of AT&T common
stock held by Cox in exchange  for an entity  owning  cable  television  systems
serving   approximately   312,000   customers  and  certain  other  net  assets.
Specifically,  AT&T exchanged $1.1 billion of investments and related  advances,
$0.9 billion of  franchise  costs and $0.5 billion of other net assets for stock
valued at $2.7 billion on March 15, 2000. The  transaction  resulted in a pretax
gain of $189.

LENFEST COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

         On January 18, 2000, AT&T sold its ownership in Lenfest Communications,
Inc. to a subsidiary of Comcast.  In connection  with the sale, we received 47.3
million shares of Comcast Class A Special common stock. The transaction resulted
in a pretax gain of $224.

CONCERT

         On  January  5,  2000,  AT&T and  British  Telecommunications  plc (BT)
announced  financial  closure of  Concert,  their  global  communications  joint
venture. AT&T contributed all of its international gateway-to-gateway assets, as
well  as  the  economic  value  of  approximately  270  multinational  customers
specifically targeted for direct sales by Concert.

ACC EUROPE

         On November  5, 1999,  AT&T sold ACC Corp.  (ACC) in Europe,  including
ACC's  principal  operations  in the United  Kingdom as well as ACC's  operating
companies in France, Germany and Italy, to WORLDxCHANGE Communications.  We were
required to dispose of this investment pursuant to a government mandate since it
would have competed directly with Concert.  The transaction resulted in a pretax
loss of $179.

IBM GLOBAL NETWORK

         On April 30, 1999,  AT&T  completed its  acquisition  of the IBM Global
Network  business  (renamed AT&T Global Network Services or AGNS) and its assets
in the  United  States.  The  non-U.S.  acquisitions  were  completed  in phases
throughout  1999 and  during the first  quarter of 2000.  Under the terms of the
agreement,  AT&T  acquired  the  global  network of IBM,  and the two  companies
entered  into  outsourcing  agreements  with each  other.  The  acquisition  was
accounted for under the purchase method.  Accordingly,  the operating results of
AGNS have been included in the accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements
since the date of  acquisition.  The pro forma impact of AGNS on historical AT&T
results is not material.
<PAGE>

TELEPORT COMMUNICATIONS GROUP INC.

         On July 23, 1998, AT&T completed a merger with Teleport  Communications
Group Inc.  (TCG)  pursuant to an agreement  and plan of merger dated January 8,
1998.  Each share of TCG common stock was  exchanged  for 1.4145  shares of AT&T
common  stock,  resulting  in  the  issuance  of  272.4  million  shares  in the
transaction.  The  merger  was  accounted  for as a pooling  of  interests,  and
accordingly,  AT&T's  results of operations,  financial  position and cash flows
were  restated  to  reflect  the  merger.   In  1998,   we  recognized   $85  of
merger-related  expenses.  Premerger  TCG revenue was $455,  and net losses were
$118, for the six months ended June 30, 1998.  Elimination  entries between AT&T
and TCG were not material. On April 22, 1998, TCG purchased ACC for an aggregate
value of approximately $1,100, including approximately $700 in goodwill.

OTHER DISPOSITIONS

         On March 3,  1998,  AT&T  sold its 45%  common  share  interest  in LIN
Television Corp., a subsidiary of LIN Broadcasting  Company,  for $742 to Hicks,
Muse,  Tate and Furst Inc. We recognized a pretax gain of $317. Also on March 3,
1998,  AT&T sold AT&T  Solutions  Customer  Care to MATRIXX  Marketing  Inc.,  a
teleservices unit of Cincinnati Bell, for $625. AT&T recognized a pretax gain of
$350 in 1998 on the sale.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

         On April 2, 1998, AT&T sold AT&T Universal Card Services Inc. (UCS) for
$3,500 to Citigroup,  Inc. The after-tax gain resulting from the disposal of UCS
was  $1,290,  or $0.48 per diluted  share.  Included  in the  transaction  was a
cobranding and  joint-marketing  agreement.  In addition,  we received $5,722 in
settlement of receivables from UCS.

         The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  AT&T  reflect  UCS  as  a
discontinued operation.  Accordingly,  the revenue, costs and expenses, and cash
flows of this business have been  excluded from the  respective  captions in the
1998 Consolidated  Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
and  have  been  reported  through  the  date of  disposition  as  "Income  from
discontinued  operations,"  net of  applicable  income  taxes,  and as "Net cash
provided  by  discontinued  operations"  for all  periods  presented.  The  gain
associated  with  this  sale is  reflected  as  "Gain  on  sale of  discontinued
operations," net of applicable income taxes.

         Summarized financial information for UCS was as follows:

                                                                       1998
                                                                       ----

         No  interest   expense  was  allocated  to  UCS  in  1998  due  to  the
immateriality of the amounts;  however,  UCS recorded direct interest expense of
$85 in 1998, primarily related to amounts payable to AT&T.

ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

         As a result of our evaluation of recent changes in our industry and the
views of regulatory  authorities,  AT&T expects that the amortization period for
all  licensing  costs,  franchise  costs,  and  goodwill  associated  with newly
acquired wireless,  telecommunications,  and cable operations will not exceed 25
years.

         Basic  earnings  per share (EPS) for AT&T Common  Stock Group for 2000,
1999 and 1998 were  computed by dividing  AT&T Common  Stock Group income by the
weighted- average number of shares  outstanding  during the year.

         Diluted EPS for AT&T Common Stock Group was  computed by dividing  AT&T
Common Stock Group income,  adjusted for the  conversion of  securities,  by the
weighted-average  number of shares and  dilutive  potential  shares  outstanding
during the year, assuming conversion of the potential shares at the beginning of
the years  presented.  Shares  issuable upon  conversion  of preferred  stock of
subsidiaries, convertible debt securities of subsidiary, stock options and other
performance   awards  have  been   included  in  the  diluted   calculation   of
weighted-average  shares to the extent that the assumed  issuance of such shares
would have been dilutive, as illustrated below. The convertible quarterly income
preferred securities were antidilutive and were excluded from the computation of
diluted EPS.  Computed on a yearly basis,  the dividends would have an after-tax
impact to earnings of approximately $155. Assuming conversion of the securities,
the  dividends  would no longer be included as a reduction to net income and the
securities would convert into 67 million shares of AT&T common stock.

         A  reconciliation  of the  income  and share  components  for basic and
diluted EPS  calculations  with  respect to AT&T Common  Stock Group  continuing
operations is as follows:

         Basic EPS for AT&T  Wireless  Group for the period from April 27, 2000,
the stock  offering  date,  through  December 31, 2000, was computed by dividing
AT&T Wireless Group income by the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding
of AT&T  Wireless  Group of 361  million.  There  were no  potentially  dilutive
securities outstanding at December 31, 2000.

         Basic EPS for LMG was  computed  by dividing  LMG income  (loss) by the
weighted-average  number of shares  outstanding  of LMG of 2,572 million in 2000
and 2,519 million from the March 9, 1999, date of issuance  through December 31,
1999. Potentially dilutive securities, including fixed and nonvested performance
awards and stock options,  have not been factored into the dilutive calculations
because past history has indicated that these contracts are generally settled in
cash.  There  were 96 million  and 124  million  of these  potentially  dilutive
securities outstanding at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The diluted
earnings per share  calculation  for 2000 also  excludes  approximately  700,000
warrants outstanding at December 31, 2000, which were antidilutive. In addition,
since LMG had a loss in 1999, the impact of any potential shares would have been
antidilutive.

7.  NET RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

         During 2000, we recorded $7,029 of net restructuring and other charges,
which included $6,179 of asset impairment  charges related to Excite@Home,  $759
for  restructuring  and exit costs  associated with AT&T's  initiative to reduce
costs,  and  $91  related  to  the   government-mandated   disposition  of  AT&T
Communications (U.K.) Ltd., which would have competed directly with Concert.

         The charges related to Excite@Home  included $4,609 of asset impairment
charges recorded by Excite@Home  associated with the impairment of goodwill from
various acquisitions, including Excite, and a related goodwill impairment charge
of $1,570  recorded by AT&T associated with goodwill from the acquisition of our
investment in Excite@Home.

         The  impairments   resulted  from  the   deterioration  of  the  market
conditions and market valuations of Internet-related companies during the fourth
quarter of 2000,  which caused  Excite@Home to conclude that  intangible  assets
related  to  their  acquisitions  of  Internet-related   companies  may  not  be
recoverable.  In accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed  Of",  Excite@Home
conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
acquired  intangible  assets.  This assessment  resulted in a determination that
certain  acquired  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  related  to  these
acquisitions,  including  Excite,  were  impaired as of December 31, 2000.  As a
result, we recorded impairment charges of $4,609 in December 2000,  representing
the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over their fair value.

         The review for impairment included a review of publicly-traded Internet
companies that are comparable to the companies that Excite@Home acquired.  These
companies   experienced  a  substantial   decline  in  stock  price  and  market
capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2000.

         Excite@Home also reviewed the business climate for Internet advertising
and web-based infrastructure companies as of December 31, 2000, and observed the
following: (1) investor and consumer enthusiasm for the Internet sector severely
deteriorated  during the fourth  quarter of 2000;  (2) many Internet  companies,
including those acquired by Excite@Home,  experienced significant  decelerations
in  their  growth  both  as  a  result  of  economic   conditions   and  due  to
Internet-sector  specific  issues such as  competition  and the weakening of the

<PAGE>

Internet advertising market; and (3) funding sources for Internet-based consumer
businesses,  which require  considerable  amounts of capital,  had substantially
evaporated  as of December 31, 2000.  As a result,  Excite@Home  concluded  that
fundamental,  permanent and significant  adverse changes had occurred during the
fourth quarter of 2000 in the business climate for companies  providing Internet
advertising and other web-based services.

         In addition,  Excite@Home  reviewed operating and cash flow projections
that existed at the time Excite@Home made the acquisitions and that were used as
a basis upon which the decisions to complete the  acquisitions  were made. These
operating and cash flow projections indicated that the acquired companies,  over
their useful lives,  would be profitable and generate  positive cash flows.  The
operating and cash flow projections were compared to operating results after the
date of the  acquisitions  through  December 31,  2000,  as well as to projected
operating   results  for  2001.   These   comparisons   indicated  that  certain
acquisitions  generated  operating and cash flow losses through the end of 2000,
and were projected to continue generating operating and cash flow losses for the
foreseeable future.

         As  a  result  of  these  factors,   Excite@Home  determined  that  the
intangible  assets  related to the  acquisitions  might not be  recoverable  and
conducted impairment tests.

         Generally,  the impairment tests were performed at an asset group level
corresponding  to the  lowest  level at which cash  flows  independent  of other
assets  could be  identified.  Each asset group  consisted  of the  goodwill and
acquired  identifiable  intangible  assets  related to a  specific  acquisition.
Acquired intangible assets were combined for those acquisitions where separately
identifiable cash flows that are largely  independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets could not be identified.

         For each of the asset groups to be tested for  impairment,  Excite@Home
projected undiscounted cash flows over a future projection period of five years,
based on Excite@Home's  determination  of the current  remaining useful lives of
the asset  groups,  plus an  undiscounted  terminal  period cash flow to reflect
disposition  of the  entities  at the end of their  useful  lives.  Undiscounted
future cash flows were estimated using projected net realizable value in a sales
transaction  (undiscounted  cash flows  during the  expected  remaining  holding
period until disposition were estimated as negligible).  The undiscounted future
cash flows were  compared  to the  carrying  amount of each asset  group and for
those asset groups where the carrying  amount exceeded the  undiscounted  future
cash flows, Excite@Home concluded that the asset group was impaired.

         Excite@Home  measured the  impairment  loss  related to impaired  asset
groups  based on the  amount by which  the  carrying  amount of the asset  group
exceeded the fair value of the asset group.  Measurement of fair value was based
on an analysis by Excite@Home  utilizing the best  information  available in the
circumstances using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections,  and
including the discounted cash flow and market comparison  valuation  techniques.
The discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes
and was based on  Excite@Home's  best  estimate of projected  future cash flows,
including  terminal value cash flows expected to result from the  disposition of
the asset at the end of its useful life, discounted at our weighted average cost
of  capital.  Weighted  average  cost of capital  was based on  historical  risk
premiums required by investors for companies of Excite@Home's size, industry and
capital structure and included risk factors specific to Excite@Home.  The market
comparison model represented  Excite@Home's  estimate of the prices that a buyer
would be  willing to pay  currently  for  similar  assets,  based on  comparable
products and services,  customer base,  risks,  earnings  capabilities and other
factors.
<PAGE>

         Based on the foregoing,  Excite@Home recorded an impairment  write-down
of $4,609 in the  aggregate,  which was allocated to each asset group based on a
comparison of carrying values and fair values. The impairment  write-down within
each asset group was allocated first to goodwill, and if goodwill was reduced to
zero, to identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values.

         Also as a  result  of the  foregoing,  AT&T  recorded  a  goodwill  and
acquistion-related  impairment  charge  associated  with the  acquisition of our
investment in  Excite@Home.  The  write-down of our investment to fair value was
determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows.

         Since  we own  approximately  23%  of  Excite@Home,  77% of the  charge
recorded by  Excite@Home  was not  included as a reduction to AT&T's net income,
but  rather  was  eliminated  in our 2000  Consolidated  Statement  of Income as
"Minority interest income (expense)."

         The $759 charge for  restructuring  and exit plans was primarily due to
headcount  reductions,  mainly in  network  operations  and  Business  Services,
including  the  consolidation  of  customer-care  and call  centers,  as well as
synergies created by the MediaOne merger.

         Included in exit costs was $503 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  7,300  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  Approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  Approximately
6,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 600 to voluntary terminations.

         We also  recorded $62 of network lease and other  contract  termination
costs  associated  with penalties  incurred as part of notifying  vendors of the
termination of these contracts during the year, and net losses of $32 related to
the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergies created by the MediaOne
merger.

         The  following   table  displays  the  activity  and  balances  of  the
restructuring reserve account:

Balance at December 31, 2000..           $259          $173       $36     $468

         Deductions reflect cash payments of $245, $209 and $369, for 1998, 1999
and 2000,  respectively.  These payments  included cash termination  benefits of
$124, $40 and $257, respectively,  which were primarily funded through cash from

<PAGE>

operations.  Deductions also reflect  noncash  utilization of $420, $43 and $170
for 1998, 1999 and 2000,  respectively.  Noncash  utilization  included deferred
severance  payments  primarily related to executives,  and a reversal in 1998 of
$348  related  to the  1995  restructuring  plan.  Nearly  75% of the  employees
affected by the 1999 and 2000 restructuring charges have left their positions as
of December 31, 2000.

         Also  included  in  restructuring  and  exit  costs in 2000 was $144 of
benefit plan curtailment  costs associated with employee  separations as part of
these exit plans. Further, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $18 related
to the  write-down  of  unrecoverable  assets in  certain  businesses  where the
carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows.

         During 1999, we recorded $1,506 of net restructuring and other charges.

         A  $594  in-process   research  and  development  charge  was  recorded
reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI,
as of  the  date  of  acquisition,  which  had  not  yet  reached  technological
feasibility or had no alternative future use. The projects identified related to
efforts to offer voice over Internet protocol (IP),  product-integration efforts
for advanced  set-top devices that would enable the offering of  next-generation
digital    services   and   cost-savings    efforts   for    broadband-telephony
implementation.  In addition,  Excite@Home had research and development  efforts
underway,  including projects to allow for  self-provisioning of devices and the
development  of  next-generation   client  software,   network  and  back-office
infrastructure to enable a variety of network devices beyond personal computers,
and improved  design for the regional  data  centers'  infrastructure.  We began
testing  IP-telephony  equipment  in  the  field  in  late-2000,  we  anticipate
beginning field trials for  next-generation  digital services in late-2001,  and
have   completed   trials   related  to  our  telephony   cost   reductions  and
implementation  has begun in certain markets.  Although there are  technological
issues to overcome to successfully complete the acquired in-process research and
development,  we expect successful  completion.  If, however,  AT&T is unable to
establish   technological    feasibility   and   produce   commercially   viable
products/services,  anticipated  incremental  future cash flows  attributable to
expected profits from such new products/services may not be realized.

         A $531 asset impairment charge was recorded in 1999 associated with the
planned disposal of certain wireless  communications  equipment resulting from a
program to increase  the  capacity  and  operating  efficiency  of our  wireless
network.  As part of a multivendor  program,  contracts  have been executed with
select vendors to replace  significant  portions of our wireless  infrastructure
equipment in the western  United States and the  metropolitan  New York markets.
The program is intended to provide Wireless  Services with the newest technology
available  and allow it to evolve to new,  next-generation  digital  technology,
which is designed to provide high-speed data capabilities.

         The planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure  equipment
required an  evaluation of asset  impairment in accordance  with SFAS No. 121 to
write-down these assets to their fair value,  which was estimated by discounting
the  expected  future cash flows of these  assets  through the date of disposal.
Since the assets will remain in service from the date of the decision to dispose
of these assets to the disposal date, the remaining net book value of the assets
will be  depreciated  over this period.  As of December 31, 2000,  approximately
$320 of the asset impairment reserve has been utilized for assets that have been
disposed of and written  off. The  remaining  net book value of these assets was
approximately  $23 at  December  31,  2000,  which will be  depreciated  over an
estimated remaining useful life of three months.
<PAGE>

         Also in 1999,  a $145  charge  for  restructuring  and exit  costs  was
recorded as part of AT&T's  initiative to reduce costs.  The  restructuring  and
exit plans primarily  focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount
reductions  in  Business   Services  and  network   operations,   including  the
consolidation of customer-care and call centers.

         Included in exit costs was $142 of cash termination benefits associated
with the separation of  approximately  2,800  employees as part of voluntary and
involuntary  termination plans.  Approximately  one-half of the separations were
management  employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  Approximately
1,700  employee  separations  were  related  to  involuntary   terminations  and
approximately 1,100 to voluntary terminations.

         We also recorded net losses of $307 related to the  government-mandated
disposition  of  certain  international  businesses  that  would  have  competed
directly with Concert,  and $50 related to a  contribution  agreement  Broadband
entered into with Phoenixstar, Inc. That agreement requires Broadband to satisfy
certain  liabilities owed by Phoenixstar and its subsidiaries.  In addition,  we
recorded  benefits of $121 related to the settlement of pension  obligations for
former employees who accepted AT&T's 1998 voluntary retirement incentive program
(VRIP) offer.

         During 1998, we recorded $2,514 of net restructuring and other charges.
The bulk of the charge was associated  with our overall  cost-reduction  program
and the approximately 15,300 management employees who accepted the VRIP offer. A
restructuring  charge of $2,724 was  composed of $2,254 and $169 for pension and
postretirement  special-termination benefits, respectively, $263 of benefit plan
curtailment  losses  and $38 of other  administrative  costs.  We also  recorded
charges of $125 for  related  facility  costs and $150 for  executive-separation
costs.  These  charges were  partially  offset by benefits of $940 as we settled
pension benefit obligations of 13,700 of the total VRIP employees.  In addition,
the VRIP charges were partially  offset by the reversal of $256 of 1995 business
restructuring  reserves primarily  resulting from the overlap of VRIP on certain
1995 projects.

         Also  included in the 1998 net  restructuring  and other  charges  were
asset  impairment  charges  totaling  $718,  of which  $633 was  related  to our
decision not to pursue Total Service Resale (TSR) as a  local-service  strategy.
We also recorded an $85 asset  impairment  charge  related to the  write-down of
unrecoverable  assets in certain  international  operations  where the  carrying
value was no longer  supported  by future  cash  flows.  This charge was made in
connection  with the review of  certain  operations  that  would  have  competed
directly with Concert.

         Additionally,  $85 of  merger-related  expenses was recorded in 1998 in
connection  with  the TCG  merger,  which  was  accounted  for as a  pooling  of
interests.  Partially  offsetting  these  charges was a $92 reversal of the 1995
restructuring  reserve.  This  reversal  reflected  reserves  no  longer  deemed
necessary.  The reversal  primarily  included  separation  costs  attributed  to
projects completed at a cost lower than originally anticipated.  Consistent with
the  three-year  plan, the 1995  restructuring  initiatives  were  substantially
completed by the end of 1998.

8.  INVESTMENT IN LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP

         As a result of our merger with TCI, we acquired  Liberty Media Group, a
wholly-owned  investment  accounted  for under the equity  method  (see Note 4).
Summarized results of operations for Liberty Media Group were as follows:

         During 2000 and 1999,  certain  investees of Liberty Media Group issued
common  stock.  Changes in the equity of the  investees,  net of the dilution of
LMG's ownership  interest,  resulted in an increase to AT&T's additional paid-in
capital of $355 and $109 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

9.  OTHER INVESTMENTS

         We have  investments  in various  companies and  partnerships  that are
accounted for under the equity method and included within "Other investments and
related  advances" in the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  Under the
equity  method,  investments  are stated at initial  cost,  and are adjusted for
subsequent contributions and our share of earnings, losses and distributions. At
December  31,  2000 and 1999,  we had  equity  investments  (other  than LMG) of
$13,624 and  $18,454,  respectively.  The  carrying  value of these  investments
exceeded our share of the underlying reported net assets by approximately $8,720
and $12,530, at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The goodwill is being
amortized  over periods  ranging  from 15 to 40 years.  Pretax  amortization  of
goodwill was $571,  $495,  and $52 in 2000,  1999, and 1998,  respectively.  The
amortization  is shown net of income  taxes as a  component  of "Net losses from
other equity investments" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
Distributions from equity investments totaled $214, $317 and $360, for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(a)      At  December  31,  2000  and  1999,  we  owned  48,942,172   shares  of
         Cablevision  Systems  Corporation  Class A common  stock,  which  had a
         closing market price of $84.94 and $75.50 per share,  respectively,  on
         those dates. Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision) redeemed all
         of its outstanding  preferred stock and issued additional common stock,
         and issued shares of its common stock for acquisitions.  As a result of
         these transactions,  AT&T's ownership interest in Cablevision decreased
         from 32.04% to 27.98%. Due to the dilution of AT&T's ownership interest
         in  Cablevision,  net of the  increase in  Cablevision's  equity,  AT&T
         recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of $170 in 2000.

(b)      On January 5, 2000, we formed Concert, our  global-communications joint
         venture with BT.

(c)      At December 31, 2000, we owned  18,900,000  shares of  Net2Phone,  Inc.
         Class A common  stock,  which had a closing  market  price of $7.38 per
         share on that date.

(d)      This investment is accounted for under the equity method because of our
         ability  to elect  certain  members of the board of  directors  of this
         entity, which we believe provides us with significant influence.

(e)      On December 29,  2000,  AB Cellular  completed  the  redemption  of our
         equity interest in AB Cellular.  Voting interest in AB Cellular was 50%
         at December 31, 1999.

(f)      On  August 28,  2000,  AT&T and  Excite@Home  announced  the closing of
         their extension contracts and governance reorganization. As a result of
         the governance  changes,  AT&T gained a controlling  interest and began
         consolidating  Excite@Home's  results  on  September  1,  2000.  As  of
         December 31, 2000,  AT&T had an approximate  23% economic  interest and
         74% voting interest in  Excite@Home.  We owned 7,924,422 and 63,720,000

<PAGE>

         shares of  Excite@Home  Class A common  stock at December  31, 2000 and
         1999, respectively, which had closing market prices of $5.53 and $42.88
         per share,  respectively,  on those dates. We also owned 86,595,578 and
         30,800,000  shares of Excite@Home  Class B common stock at December 31,
         2000 and 1999, respectively, which are not publicly traded. During 2000
         and 1999,  Excite@Home  issued  shares of its common  stock for various
         acquisitions.  As a  result  of  these  transactions,  AT&T's  economic
         interest in Excite@Home decreased from 25% to 23% in 2000, and from 38%
         to  25%  in  1999,  respectively.  Due to  the  resulting  increase  in
         Excite@Home's  equity, net of the dilution of AT&T's ownership interest
         in Excite@Home, AT&T recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital
         of $116 and $527 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

accounted for under the equity method was as follows:

         In  addition,  we have a 25.51%  interest in TWE.  This  investment  is
"held-for-sale"  at December 31, 2000.  Accordingly,  we are no longer recording
equity earnings (losses) on this investment.

         We also  have  investments  accounted  for  under  the cost  method  of
accounting.  Under this method, investments are stated at cost, and earnings are
recognized  to the  extent  distributions  are  received  from  the  accumulated
earnings  of the  investee.  Distributions  received  in excess  of  accumulated
earnings  are  recognized  as a  reduction  of  our  investment  balance.  These
investments,  which are covered under the scope of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain   Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity   Securities,"  are  classified  as
"available-for-sale"  and are carried at fair value with any unrealized  gain or
loss, net of income taxes, being included within other comprehensive income as a
component of shareowners' equity. Approximately $2,102 of these investments have
been  classified as current  assets since they are indexed to certain  currently
maturing debt instruments.

         In February  2000,  we entered into a 364-day,  $10 billion  syndicated
credit facility upon the expiration of existing credit  facilities.  On December
28, 2000, we entered into a new 364-day,  $25 billion credit facility syndicated
to 39 banks.  As a result,  the  outstanding  $10 billion  credit  facility  was
terminated.  The credit facility is for commercial  paper back-up and was unused
at  December  31,  2000.  The credit  facility  agreement  contains a  financial
covenant that requires AT&T to maintain a net  debt-to-EBITDA  ratio (as defined
in the  credit  agreement)  not  exceeding  3.00 to 1.00  for  four  consecutive
quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2000, we
were in compliance with this covenant.

         At December 31,  1999,  we had a 364-day,  $7 billion  revolving-credit
facility  with a  consortium  of 42  lenders.  We also had  additional  364-day,
revolving-credit facilities of $3 billion. These lines were for commercial paper
back-up and were unused at December 31, 1999.

(a)      Included in these balances was $946 and $975 representing the remaining
         excess of the fair value over the recorded  value of debt in connection
         with the TCI and MediaOne mergers at December 31, 2000 and December 31,
         1999,  respectively.  The excess is being  amortized over the remaining
         lives of the underlying debt obligations.

(b)      The actual interest paid on our debt obligations may have differed from
         the stated amount due to our entering into interest rate swap contracts
         to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and our strategy to reduce
         finance costs (see Note 12).

         On January 26, 1999,  AT&T filed a registration  statement with the SEC
for the offering and sale of up to $10 billion of notes and warrants to purchase
notes,  resulting in a total available shelf  registration of $13.1 billion.  On
March 26,  1999,  AT&T issued $8 billion in notes.  We received  net proceeds of
approximately  $7.9  billion  from  the sale of the  notes.  The  proceeds  were
utilized to repay  commercial paper issued in connection with the TCI merger and
toward  funding the share  repurchase  program.  On  September  14,  1999,  AT&T
completed  a $450  bond  offering  in  connection  with  the  same  registration
statement.  The proceeds from the issuance  were utilized for general  corporate
purposes.

         Included  in  long-term  debt  are   subsidiary-obligated   mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely subordinated
debt  securities,  exchangeable  notes and other  exchangeable  debt acquired in
connection with the TCI and MediaOne mergers.

         The TCI Trusts were created for the exclusive  purpose of issuing trust
preferred  securities  and  investing  the proceeds  thereof  into  subordinated
deferrable   interest  notes   (subordinated   debt   securities)  of  TCI.  The
subordinated  debt  securities have interest rates equal to the interest rate of
the  corresponding  trust  preferred  securities and have maturity dates ranging
from 30 to 49 years from the date of  issuance.  The  preferred  securities  are
mandatorily  redeemable upon repayment of the subordinated debt securities,  and
are callable by AT&T.  The  Financing I and II trust  preferred  securities  are
callable  at  face  value  beginning  in  January  and May  2001,  respectively.

<PAGE>

Financing III trust preferred  securities are callable at 104.825% of face value
beginning in March 2007. Financing IV trust preferred securities are callable at
face  value  beginning  in  March  2002.  TCI  effectively  provides  a full and
unconditional guarantee of the TCI Trusts' obligations under the trust preferred
securities.  In 2000,  AT&T provided a full and  unconditional  guarantee of the
trust  preferred  securities  for  TCI  Communications  Financing  I,  II and IV
subsidiary trusts (see Note 19).

         AT&T has the  right to defer  interest  payments  up to 20  consecutive
quarters; as a consequence,  dividend payments on the trust preferred securities
can be deferred by the trusts during any such interest-payment period.

         Certain  subsidiary trusts of MediaOne  (MediaOne Trusts) had preferred
securities outstanding at December 31, 2000, as follows:

         The  MediaOne  Trusts  exist  for the  purpose  of  issuing  the  trust
preferred  securities  and  investing  the proceeds  thereof  into  subordinated
deferrable  interest  notes  (subordinated  deferrable  notes) of MediaOne Group
Funding,   Inc.,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  MediaOne.  The  subordinated
deferrable  notes have the same  interest  rate and  maturity  date as the trust
preferred  securities to which they relate.  All of the subordinated  deferrable
notes are redeemable by MediaOne Group Funding, Inc. or MediaOne at a redemption
price of $25.00 per security,  plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon redemption
of the subordinated  deferrable  notes,  the trust preferred  securities will be
mandatorily redeemable,  at a price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
distributions.  The 7.96% subordinated  deferrable notes became redeemable after
September  11,  2000.  The  9.50% and 8.25%  subordinated  deferrable  notes are
redeemable after October 29, 2001. The 9.04%  subordinated  deferrable notes are
redeemable after October 28, 2003. MediaOne has effectively  provided a full and
unconditional  guarantee of the  MediaOne  Trusts'  obligations  under the trust
preferred securities.  In 2000, AT&T provided a full and unconditional guarantee
of MediaOne's trust preferred securities (see Note 19)

         AT&T has the  right to defer  interest  payments  up to 20  consecutive
quarters; as a consequence,  dividend payments on the trust preferred securities
can be deferred by the trusts during any such interest-payment period.

EXCHANGEABLE NOTES

         During 2000, we issued debt  (exchangeable  notes) which is mandatorily
redeemable  at AT&T's  option into shares of Comcast and  Microsoft  Corporation
(Microsoft) common stock, as applicable, or its cash equivalent. During 1999 and
1998,  MediaOne issued  exchangeable  notes which are mandatorily  redeemable at
MediaOne's option into (i) Vodafone American  Depository Receipts (ADRs) held by
MediaOne, (ii) the cash equivalent,  or (iii) a combination of cash and Vodafone
ADRs. The maturity value of these  exchangeable notes varies based upon the fair
market value of the security it is indexed to.

         The  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2001 are indexed to 29 million
Vodafone ADRs,  and will be exchanged at maturity based upon a redemption  value
of $9.00 in cash  plus  21/2  times  the fair  market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR
(maturity price), as follows:

                  (a) If the  maturity  price is greater  than or equal to $9.00
         plus 21/2  times the call price per share,  each  exchangeable  note is
         equivalent to 0.8101 of the maturity price;

                  (b) If the maturity  price is less than or equal to $9.00 plus
         21/2  times  the  put  price  per  share,  each  exchangeable  note  is
         equivalent to the maturity price; or

                  (c) If the  maturity  price is less than  $71.75 per share but
         greater than $58.125 per share, each exchangeable note is equivalent to
         $58.125.

         The  exchangeable  notes that  mature in 2002 are indexed to 26 million
Vodafone ADRs, and will be exchanged at maturity as follows:

                  (a) If the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR is greater than
         or equal to the call price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to
         0.8475 of a Vodafone ADR;

                  (b) If the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR is less than or
         equal to the put price,  each  exchangeable  note is  equivalent to one
         Vodafone ADR; or

                  (c) If the fair  market  value of a Vodafone  ADR is less than
         the call price but greater than the put price,  each  exchangeable note
         is  equivalent  to a fraction  of a  Vodafone  ADR equal to (i) the put
         price divided by (ii) the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR.

         The  exchangeable  notes  are  being  accounted  for  as  indexed  debt
instruments  since the  maturity  value of the debt is  dependent  upon the fair
market value of the underlying Comcast,  Microsoft and Vodafone securities.  The
exchangeable  notes  contain  embedded  options  that hedge the market risk of a
decline in value of Comcast,  Microsoft and Vodafone securities. The market risk
of a decline in Comcast  and  Microsoft  stock,  and  Vodafone  ADRs,  below the
respective put prices has been eliminated.  In addition, any market gains we may
earn have been  limited to the call prices,  with the  exception of certain debt
indexed  to  Comcast  stock and the debt  indexed to the  Vodafone  ADRs,  which
provides for our  participation  in a portion of the market gains above the call
price.
<PAGE>

         Since the Comcast,  Microsoft,  and Vodafone securities are cost method
investments  being accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities under SFAS
No. 115,  "Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities,"
changes  in the  maturity  value of the  exchangeable  notes and the  underlying
securities  are being  recorded  as  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income
taxes, within other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity.

         The  exchangeable  notes indexed to Comcast  common stock and Microsoft
common stock are secured by the Comcast and Microsoft investments AT&T owns. The
exchangeable notes indexed to Vodafone ADRs are unsecured  obligations,  ranking
equally  in right  of  payment  with  all  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated
obligations of AT&T.

OTHER EXCHANGEABLE DEBT

         During 2000, we entered into a series of purchased and written  options
on 21.9 million shares of Microsoft common stock, and issued floating rate debt.
The  carrying  value of the debt at December 31,  2000,  was $1,369,  which pays
interest at the three-month  London  Inter-Bank  Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.4%.
The debt matures annually with $458 maturing in 2003 and 2004, and $453 maturing
in 2005, and is repayable at AT&T's option in either Microsoft stock or cash.

         In addition, during 1999 two subsidiaries of MediaOne,  MediaOne SPC IV
and MediaOne SPC VI,  entered into a series of purchased and written  options on
Vodafone ADRs  contributed to them by MediaOne,  and issued  floating rate debt.
The  carrying  value of the debt at December 31,  2000,  was $1,739,  which pays
interest  at the  three-month  LIBOR  plus  0.5%.  This  debt  matures  in equal
quarterly  installments  beginning  in 2003 and  ending in 2005.  The  assets of
MediaOne SPC IV, which are primarily  29.1 million  Vodafone ADRs, are available
only to pay the creditors of MediaOne SPC IV.  Likewise,  the assets of MediaOne
SPC VI, which are primarily  18.0 million  Vodafone  ADRs, are available only to
pay the creditors of MediaOne SPC VI.

securities)  to  Microsoft.  Proceeds of the issuance  were invested by the AT&T
Trust in junior  subordinated  debentures  (debentures) issued by AT&T due 2029,
which represent the sole asset of the AT&T Trust.

         The quarterly  preferred  securities pay dividends at an annual rate of
5.0% of the liquidation  preference of $50 per security,  and are convertible at
any time prior to maturity into 66.667 million shares of AT&T common stock.  The
quarterly  preferred   securities  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon
repayment  of the  debentures  at  maturity  or their  earlier  redemption.  The
conversion  feature can be  terminated,  under certain  conditions,  after three
years.

         The debentures  will make a quarterly  payment in arrears of 62.5 cents
per  security on the last day of March,  June,  September  and  December of each
year.  AT&T has the right to defer such interest  payments up to 20  consecutive
quarters.  As a  consequence,  quarterly  dividend  payments  on  the  quarterly
preferred  securities  can be  deferred  by  the  AT&T  Trust  during  any  such
interest-payment period. If AT&T defers any interest payments, we may not, among
other  things,  pay any  dividends  on our common  stock  until all  interest in
arrears is paid to the AT&T Trust.

         Dividends on the quarterly preferred  securities were $250 and $135 for
the years ended  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and are  reported
within "Minority  interest income  (expense)" in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Statements of Income.

         On June 16, 1999,  AT&T also issued to  Microsoft 40 million  warrants,
each to purchase  one share of AT&T common  stock at a price of $75 per share at
the end of  three  years.  Alternatively,  the  warrants  are  exercisable  on a
cashless basis. If the warrants are not exercised on the three-year  anniversary
of the closing date, the warrants expire.

         A discount on the quarterly preferred  securities equal to the value of
the warrants of $306 was recognized and is being amortized over the 30-year life
of the  quarterly  preferred  securities  as a component of  "Minority  interest
income (expense)" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

CENTAUR FUNDING CORPORATION

         Centaur Funding Corporation (Centaur), a subsidiary of MediaOne, issued
three  series of  preferred  shares  prior to AT&T's  acquisition  of  MediaOne.
Centaur was created for the  principal  purpose of raising  capital  through the

<PAGE>

issuance of preferred  shares and investing  those proceeds into notes issued by
MediaOne SPC II, a subsidiary of MediaOne.  Principal and interest payments from
the notes are expected to be Centaur's  primary source of funds to make dividend
and redemption  payments on the preferred shares. In addition,  the dividend and
certain  redemption  payments  on the  preferred  shares will be  determined  by
reference to the  dividend and  redemption  activity of the  preferred  stock of
AirTouch Communications,  Inc. (ATI Shares) held by MediaOne SPC II. Payments on
the preferred shares are neither guaranteed nor secured by MediaOne or AT&T. The
assets of MediaOne SPC II, which include the ATI shares,  are available  only to
pay the creditors of MediaOne SPC II. These securities  remained  outstanding at
December 31, 2000 as follows:

         The Auction  Market  Preference  Shares,  Series A, have a  liquidation
value of $250  thousand  per share and  dividends  are  payable  quarterly  when
declared by Centaur's  board of directors  out of funds legally  available.  The
9.08% Cumulative  Preference  Shares,  Series B, have a liquidation  value of $1
thousand per share and dividends are payable  quarterly in arrears when declared
by Centaur's  board of directors  out of funds legally  available.  In addition,
dividends may be declared and paid only to the extent that  dividends  have been
declared and paid on the ATI shares.  The  preference  shares,  Series C, have a
liquidation value of $1 thousand per share at maturity.  The value of the Series
C will be accreted to reach its  liquidation  value upon maturity.  The Series B
shares rank equally with the Series C shares as to redemption  payments and upon
liquidation,  and the Series B and Series C shares  rank  senior to the Series A
shares as to redemption  payments and upon  liquidation.  The preference  shares
issued by Centaur are reflected within  "Minority  interest" in the accompanying
2000 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

         Dividends  on the  preferred  shares  were  $55  for the  period  ended
December 31, 2000, and were included within "Minority interest income (expense)"
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

12.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         In the normal course of business, we use various financial instruments,
including derivative financial instruments,  for purposes other than trading. We
do not use derivative  financial  instruments  for speculative  purposes.  These
instruments  include letters of credit,  guarantees of debt,  interest rate swap
agreements,  foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  option contracts and equity
hedges. Collateral is generally not required for these types of instruments.

         By their  nature,  all such  instruments  involve  risk,  including the
credit risk of nonperformance by counterparties,  and our maximum potential loss
may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet.  However, at December 31,
2000 and 1999, in management's opinion, there was no significant risk of loss in
the  event  of   nonperformance   of  the   counterparties  to  these  financial
instruments.  We control our exposure to credit risk through  credit  approvals,
credit limits and monitoring procedures. We do not have any significant exposure
to  any  individual  customer  or  counterparty,   nor  do  we  have  any  major
concentration of credit risk related to any financial instruments.
<PAGE>

LETTERS OF CREDIT

         Letters of credit are purchased  guarantees that ensure our performance
or payment to third parties in accordance  with specified  terms and conditions.
Letters of credit do not create any additional risk to AT&T.

GUARANTEES OF DEBT

         From  time to  time,  we  guarantee  the debt of our  subsidiaries  and
certain  unconsolidated  joint ventures.  Prior to the merger, TCI had agreed to
take  certain  steps to support  debt  compliance  with  respect to  obligations
aggregating  $1,461 and $1,720 at December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  of
certain  cable  television  partnerships  in  which  TCI  has a  non-controlling
ownership interest. Although there can be no assurance, management believes that
it  will  not be  required  to  meet  its  obligations  under  such  guarantees.
Additionally,  in connection with the  restructuring  of AT&T in 1996, we issued
guarantees for certain debt obligations of our former  subsidiaries AT&T Capital
Corp. and NCR. The amount of guaranteed  debt associated with AT&T Capital Corp.
and NCR was $48 and $56 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

         We enter into  interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in
interest  rates and to lower our overall costs of financing.  We enter into swap
agreements to manage the  fixed/floating  mix of our debt  portfolio in order to
reduce aggregate risk to interest rate movements. Interest rate swaps also allow
us to raise funds at floating rates and  effectively  swap them into fixed rates
that are lower than those  available to us if  fixed-rate  borrowings  were made
directly.  These agreements involve the exchange of floating-rate for fixed-rate
payments,  fixed-rate  for  floating-rate  payments or  floating-rate  for other
floating-rate  payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount.
Fixed  interest rate  payments at December 31, 2000,  were at rates ranging from
6.05% to 8.20%.  Floating-rate payments are based on rates tied to the LIBOR. In
addition,  we also have combined interest rate, foreign currency swap agreements
for  foreign-currency-denominated  debt,  which hedge our risk to both  interest
rate and currency movements.

         The following table indicates the types of swaps in use at December 31,
2000 and 1999, and their weighted-average interest rates. Average variable rates
are those in effect at the reporting date and may change  significantly over the
lives of the contracts.

         The weighted-average  remaining terms of the swap contracts were 11 and

<PAGE>

FOREIGN EXCHANGE

         We enter into foreign currency  exchange  contracts,  including forward
and option  contracts,  to manage our  exposure to changes in currency  exchange
rates  related  to  foreign-currency-denominated  transactions.  In  2000,  this
consisted  principally  of Brazilian  reais and Swiss francs related to debt. In
1999,  this consisted  principally of European  Union currency  (Euro),  British
pounds  sterling and  Japanese Yen  contracts  related to the  reimbursement  to
foreign telephone  companies for their portion of the revenue billed by AT&T for
calls  placed  in the  United  States  to a foreign  country  and other  foreign
currency  payables  and  receivables.  In  addition,  we are  subject to foreign
exchange risk related to other foreign-currency-denominated transactions.

COLLARS

         We enter into option  agreements  to hedge our exposure on debt that is
indexed to securities we own. During 2000, we entered into a series of purchased
and written  options  related to a portion of our  holdings in  Microsoft  stock
(Microsoft collar),  which is indexed to floating rate debt. The collar has been
designated  and is effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment in Microsoft  stock.  The Microsoft  collar is carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the Microsoft  stock.  The carrying value of the
Microsoft collar was $419 at December 31, 2000.

         At the expiration of the Microsoft  collar, if the price of a Microsoft
share is equal to or less than the put price of $62.48,  we would  exercise  the
put option and deliver  all  underlying  shares of  Microsoft  common  stock and
receive  cash  equal  in  value  to (i) the put  price,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  Alternatively,  at our  option,  we can elect not to
deliver the  underlying  shares and instead  settle the put option by  receiving
cash equal in value to the (i) the  difference  between  the put price minus the
fair value of one  Microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the  underlying  share
amount. If the price of a Microsoft share is greater then the call price,  which
range from $86.26 to $118.36,  then the call option  would be  exercised  and we
would deliver all  underlying  shares and receive cash equal in value to (i) the
call price,  multiplied by (ii) the underlying share amount.  At our option,  we
can elect not to  deliver  the  underlying  shares and  instead  settle the call
option by paying cash equal in value to the (i) the difference  between the call
price  minus  the fair  value of one  Microsoft  share,  multiplied  by (ii) the
underlying  share  amount.  Any  cash  received  by AT&T  from the  exercise  or
settlement  of either put or call  option  would be used to retire the  floating
rate debt.  We would  retain cash in excess of the call price from a call option
exercise.  If the price of a  Microsoft  share is between  the put price and the
call price, the collar will expire without value.

         Prior to our  merger  with  MediaOne,  two  subsidiaries  of  MediaOne,
MediaOne  SPC IV and MediaOne  SPC VI,  entered  into a series of purchased  and
written  options  (Vodafone  collars) on Vodafone  ADRs  contributed  to them by
MediaOne,  and  issued  floating  rate  debt.  The  Vodafone  collars  have been
designated and are effective as a hedge of the market risk  associated  with our
investment  in Vodafone  ADRs.  The Vodafone  collars are carried at fair value,
with  unrealized  gains or losses,  net of income taxes,  being recorded  within
other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners' equity,  together with
any change in the fair value of the Vodafone  ADRs.  The  carrying  value of the
Vodafone collars was $453 at December 31, 2000.
<PAGE>

         At the  expiration of the MediaOne SPC IV collar,  we will receive cash
if the market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is less than  approximately  $34.00 per
share,  effectively  eliminating  downside  risk on the stock  below  $34.00 per
share.  Conversely,  if the  market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is  greater  than
approximately  $49.00 per share, we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
offset by the  corresponding  increase in the value of the  Vodafone  ADR.  This
Vodafone collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005.

         At the  expiration of the MediaOne SPC VI collar,  we will receive cash
if the market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is less than  approximately  $40.00 per
share,  effectively  eliminating  downside  risk on the stock  below  $40.00 per
share.  Conversely,  if the  market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is  greater  than
approximately  $58.00 per share, we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
offset by the  corresponding  increase in the value of the  Vodafone  ADR.  This
Vodafone collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005.

EQUITY HEDGES

         We enter into equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity
prices associated with stock appreciation rights of affiliated companies.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The  following  table  summarizes  the  notional  amounts  of  material
financial  instruments.  The notional amounts represent  agreed-upon  amounts on
which  calculations of dollars to be exchanged are based.  They do not represent
amounts  exchanged  by the  parties  and,  therefore,  are not a measure  of our
exposure.  Our  exposure  is limited to the fair value of the  contracts  with a
positive fair value plus interest receivable, if any, at the reporting date.

13.  PENSION, POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

         We sponsor noncontributory,  defined benefit pension plans covering the
majority of our employees.  Pension benefits for management  employees are based
principally on career-average  pay. Pension benefits for occupational  employees
are not directly related to pay. Pension trust  contributions  are made to trust
funds held for the sole  benefit of plan  participants.  Our  benefit  plans for
current and certain future retirees include health-care benefits, life insurance
coverage and telephone concessions.

*        Primarily  included  in "Net  restructuring  and other  charges" in the
         Consolidated Statements of Income.

         On January  26,  1998,  we  offered a  voluntary  retirement  incentive
program  (VRIP)  to  employees  who  were  eligible  participants  in  the  AT&T
Management Pension Plan.  Approximately 15,300 management employees accepted the
VRIP offer.  In connection with the VRIP, we recorded pretax charges in 1998 for
pension and postretirement plan special-termination benefits of $2,254 and $169,
respectively. We also recorded pension and postretirement plan pretax charges of
$120 and $143, respectively, which are included within net curtailment losses in
1998.  The  special-termination  benefits  reflect the value of pension  benefit
improvements and expanded eligibility for postretirement benefits. The VRIP also
permitted  employees to choose  either a total  lump-sum  distribution  of their
pension benefits or periodic future annuity payments.

         As of December 31, 1999, all 15,300 employees had terminated employment
under the VRIP. AT&T has settled the pension  obligations  covering about 15,100
of these  employees,  the  remainder of which  either chose to defer  commencing
their pension benefits or elected to receive an annuity  distribution.  Lump-sum
pension  settlements   totaling  $5.2  billion,   including  a  portion  of  the
special-pension  termination benefits referred to above,  resulted in settlement
gains of $121 and $940 recorded in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

         Our  nonqualified  pension  plans had an unfunded  accumulated  benefit
obligation  of $125 and $118 at December  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Our
postretirement  health and telephone  concession  benefit plans had  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations of $4,282 and $4,021 at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively,  which were in excess of plan assets of $1,413 and $1,635 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         The   assumptions   used  in  the   measurement   of  the  pension  and
postretirement benefit obligations are shown in the following table:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
At December 31,                                   2000     1999    1998
                                                  ----     ----    ----
<S>                                               <C>     <C>      <C>
Weighted-average assumptions:
Discount rate................................     7.5%    7.75%    6.5%
Expected return on plan assets...............     9.5%     9.5%    9.5%
Rate of compensation increase................     4.5%     4.5%    4.5%
</TABLE>

         We  assumed  a rate of  increase  in the  per  capita  cost of  covered
health-care  benefits (the  health-care  cost trend rate) of 7.6%. This rate was
assumed to gradually  decline  after 2000 to 4.5% by 2010 and then remain level.
Assumed  health-care  cost trend rates have a significant  effect on the amounts
reported for the health-care  plans. A one percentage point increase or decrease
in the assumed  health-care cost trend rate would increase or decrease the total
of the service  and  interest-cost  components  of net  periodic  postretirement
health-care  benefit  cost by $9 and $9,  respectively,  and would  increase  or
decrease the  health-care  component of the accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation by $125 and $122, respectively.

         We also sponsor  savings plans for the majority of our  employees.  The
plans allow  employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and/or  after-tax
income in accordance  with  specified  guidelines.  We match a percentage of the
employee  contributions up to certain limits. Our contributions amounted to $280
in 2000, $234 in 1999 and $204 in 1998.

14.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

         Under  the  1997  Long-term  Incentive  Program  (Program),  which  was
effective June 1, 1997, and amended on May 19, 1999 and March 14, 2000, we grant
stock options,  performance  shares,  restricted  stock and other awards on AT&T
common stock as well as stock options on AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.

         Under the Program,  there were 150 million  shares of AT&T common stock
available  for grant with a maximum of 22.5 million  common shares that could be
used for awards other than stock  options.  Beginning  with January 1, 2000, the
remaining  shares  available  for grant at December  31 of the prior year,  plus
1.75% of the shares of AT&T common stock  outstanding on January 1 of each year,
become available for grant.  There are a maximum of 37.5 million shares that may
be used for awards other than stock  options.  The  exercise  price of any stock
option is equal to the stock  price when the option is granted.  Generally,  the
options  vest over three or four years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from
the date of grant.

         Under the Program, performance share units are awarded to key employees
in the form of either  common stock or cash at the end of a  three-year  period,
based on AT&T's  total  shareholder  return  and  certain  financial-performance
targets.  Under the 1987 Long-term  Incentive  Program,  performance share units
with  the same  terms  were  also  awarded  to key  employees  based  on  AT&T's
return-to-equity performance compared with a target.
<PAGE>

         On April 27, 2000,  AT&T created a new class of stock and  completed an
offering of AT&T Wireless Group  tracking  stock.  Under the Program,  5% of the
outstanding AT&T Wireless Group shares became available for grant with a maximum
of 1.25% of the  outstanding  shares  that may be used  for  awards  other  than
options.  Beginning  with January 1, 2001,  the remaining  AT&T  Wireless  Group
shares  available  for grant at December  31 of the prior  year,  plus 2% of the
outstanding  AT&T  Wireless  Group  shares  on  January 1 of each  year,  become
available  for grant.  The  exercise  price of any stock  option is equal to the
stock price when the option is granted.  Generally, the options vest over two to
three and  one-half  years and are  exercisable  up to 10 years from the date of
grant.  In 2000,  there were no grants of awards  other than stock  options.  On
April 27, 2000,  substantially  all employees  were granted AT&T Wireless  Group
tracking stock options.

         Under the AT&T 1996  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (Plan),  which was
effective  July 1, 1996, we are  authorized  to sell up to 75 million  shares of
AT&T  common  stock to our  eligible  employees.  Under  the  terms of the Plan,
employees  may have up to 10% of their  earnings  withheld  to  purchase  AT&T's
common stock.  The purchase price of the stock on the date of exercise is 85% of
the average  high and low sale  prices of shares on the New York Stock  Exchange
for that  day.  Under  the  Plan,  we sold  approximately  6  million  shares to
employees in 2000 and 3 million shares to employees in both 1999 and 1998.

         We  apply  APB  Opinion  No.  25,   "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
Employees,"   and  related   interpretations   in  accounting   for  our  plans.
Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for our stock-based
compensation  plans other than for our  performance-based  and restricted  stock
awards and stock appreciation  rights (SARs).  Stock  based-compensation  income
(expense)  was $253,  $(462)  and $(157) in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.
These  amounts  included  income  (expense) of $269 and $(382) in 2000 and 1999,
respectively,  related to grants of SARs of affiliated companies held by certain
employees  subsequent to the TCI merger. We also entered into an equity hedge in
1999 to offset potential future  compensation  costs associated with these SARs.
(Expense)  income  related  to this  hedge was $(297) and $247 in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

         The pro forma  effect on net income for 1998 may not be  representative
of the pro forma effect on net income of future  years  because the SFAS No. 123
method of accounting for pro forma compensation  expense has not been applied to
options granted prior to January 1, 1995.

         The weighted-average fair values at date of grant for AT&T common stock
options  granted  during  2000,  1999 and 1998 were  $12.10,  $15.64  and $9.75,
respectively,  and were estimated using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model.
The  weighted-average  risk-free  interest rates applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998
were  6.29%,  5.10% and 5.33%,  respectively.  The  following  assumptions  were
applied for 2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively:  (i) expected dividend yields of
1.6%, 1.7% and 2.1%, (ii) expected  volatility  rates of 33.5%,  28.3% and 23.8%
and (iii) expected lives of 4.7 years in 2000 and 4.5 years for 1999 and 1998.

         The  weighted-average  fair  values at date of grant for AT&T  Wireless
Group  tracking  stock options  granted during 2000 was $14.20 and was estimated
using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model. The following  weighted-average
assumptions  were applied for 2000: (i) risk-free  rate of 6.53%,  (ii) expected
volatility rate of 55.0% and (iii) expected life of 3.9 years.

         In addition,  we also recorded current and deferred income tax expenses
(benefits)  related to minority  interest and net equity  losses on other equity
investments  in the  amounts of $(154)  and $(125) in 2000,  $(94) and $(344) in
1999 and $143 and $(120) in 1998, respectively.

         Deferred  income tax  liabilities  are taxes we expect to pay in future
periods.  Similarly,  deferred  income  tax  assets are  recorded  for  expected
reductions  in taxes  payable in future  periods.  Deferred  income  taxes arise
because  of  differences  in the  book  and tax  bases  of  certain  assets  and
liabilities.

</TABLE>


         At  December  31,  2000,  we  had  net  operating  loss   carryforwards
(tax-effected), excluding Excite@Home, for federal and state income tax purposes
of $79 and $164,  respectively,  expiring  through  2015.  In  addition,  we had
federal tax credit  carryforwards  of $145, of which $64 have no expiration date
and $81  expire  through  2005.  We also  had  state  tax  credit  carryforwards
(tax-effected)  of $32 expiring through 2003. In connection with the TCI merger,
we acquired certain federal and state net operating loss  carryforwards  subject
to a valuation  allowance of $59. If, in the future,  the  realization  of these
acquired  deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not, any reduction of the
associated  valuation  allowance will be allocated to reduce franchise costs and
other purchased intangibles.
<PAGE>

         At December 31, 2000,  Excite@Home had net operating loss carryforwards
(tax  effected)  for federal  and state  income tax  purposes  of $290  expiring
through 2020.  Utilization of Excite@Home's net operating loss carryforwards may
be subject to a minor annual limitation due to the ownership change  limitations
provided by the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended,  and similar  state
provisions.  The annual  limitation may result in the expiration of a portion of
Excite@Home's  net  operating  loss  carryforwards   before   utilization.   The
realization  of   Excite@Home's   net  deferred  tax  asset  is  dependent  upon
Excite@Home's  future  earnings,  if any,  the  timing  and  amount of which are
uncertain.  In addition,  Excite@Home is a separate taxpayer and is not a member
of  the  AT&T  consolidated  tax  group.  Accordingly,  Excite@Home  provided  a
valuation allowance in an amount equal to its net deferred tax assets of $702 as
of December 31, 2000. Approximately $142 of Excite@Home's valuation allowance at
December 31, 2000, is  attributable to stock option  deductions,  the benefit of
which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized.  Approximately  $269 of
Excite@Home's  valuation  allowance  at December 31, 2000,  is  attributable  to
deferred  tax assets  that,  if  realized,  will be  allocated  to first  reduce
goodwill, then other purchased intangibles, and then income tax expense.

         On November 15, 2000, we announced our intention to split-off  LMG. The
split-off  of  LMG  remains  subject  to the  receipt  of  necessary  approvals,
including a  favorable  tax ruling  from the IRS.  Pursuant  to the  tax-sharing
agreement  dated  March  9,  1999  between  AT&T and LMG,  in the  event  LMG is
split-off,  AT&T would be required to reimburse LMG  approximately  $830 for the
value of certain TCI pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards.  Also, in
connection  with a tax-sharing  agreement  between LMG and TCI that was executed
prior  to  AT&T's  acquisition  of TCI,  LMG  would  be  obligated  to pay  AT&T
approximately $138 upon its split-off from AT&T.

16.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         In the  normal  course  of  business  we are  subject  to  proceedings,
lawsuits and other  claims,  including  proceedings  under laws and  regulations
related to  environmental  and other  matters.  Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, we
are unable to ascertain the ultimate  aggregate amount of monetary  liability or
financial  impact with  respect to these  matters at December  31,  2000.  These
matters could affect the  operating  results of any one quarter when resolved in
future periods.  However, we believe that after final disposition,  any monetary
liability or financial  impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end  would
not be material to our annual consolidated financial statements.

         We lease land, buildings and equipment through contracts that expire in
various years through 2037. Our rental expense under  operating  leases was $980
in 2000,  $827 in 1999 and $742 in 1998.  The  total of  minimum  rentals  to be
received in the future under  noncancelable  operating  subleases as of December
31, 2000, was $209.
<PAGE>

         The  following  table shows our future  minimum  commitments  due under
noncancelable operating and capital leases at December 31, 2000:

         AT&T has an agreement with Motorola, Inc. to purchase a minimum of 1.25
million  digital  set-top  devices at an average price of $248 per unit in 2001.
During 2000,  AT&T  satisfied its  obligation  under a previous  agreement  with
Motorola, Inc. to purchase set-top devices.

         AT&T has entered into various purchase commitments for wireless network
equipment and handsets.  The  commitments  totaled $432 as of December 31, 2000,
and extend through 2004.

         AT&T has  committed  to provide  funding to a joint  venture with other
investors,  Alaska Native Wireless  (ANW),  which was formed in November 2000 to
participate in the Federal  Communication  Commission's  recent license spectrum
auction.  The  auction  was  concluded  in January  2001 and ANW was the highest
bidder on  approximately  $2.9 billion in licenses.  AT&T has  committed to fund
approximately  $2.6  billion  to ANW to fund  ANW's  purchase  of  licenses.  At
December  31,  2000,  AT&T had  provided  approximately  $229 of funding and has
committed to provide additional funding of approximately $2.4 billion consisting
primarily of debt securities of ANW. At the fifth  anniversary of the first date
on which  licenses  are granted to ANW,  the other  owners of ANW have rights to
require AT&T to purchase  their equity  interests.  If such rights are exercised
five  years  after  the  license  grant  date,   the  purchase  price  would  be
approximately  $950 and would be  payable,  at our  option,  in  either  cash or
marketable  securities.  In the event that these rights are exercised before the
fifth anniversary,  or in the event that the winning bid is rejected,  or if any
licenses granted to ANW are revoked or challenged, the amount that AT&T would be
required to pay would be less than $950.

         Through a joint  venture (70% owned by AT&T and 30% owned by BT),  AT&T
and BT have a 31%  ownership of AT&T Canada Corp. as a result of the 1999 merger
between AT&T Canada Corp. and MetroNet Communications,  Corp. In connection with
this merger, the AT&T and BT joint venture has the right to call, or arrange for
another  entity to call,  the  remaining  69% of AT&T  Canada for the greater of
Cdn$40.56 per share,  which  represented  the projected value as of December 31,
2000,  with an accretion of 4% each quarter that began on June 30, 2000,  or the
then-appraised  fair market value. If we do not exercise our call rights by June
30,  2003,  the shares  would be put up for  auction,  and the AT&T and BT joint
venture would have to make the shareholders whole for the difference between the
proceeds  received in auction  and the  greater of the fair market  value or the
accreted  value.  The exact  timing of any  purchase  will  likely be  partially
dependent upon the future status of Canadian foreign-ownership regulations.

17.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         AT&T has various related party transactions with Concert as a result of
the closure of this global venture in early January 2000.

         Included in revenue for the year ended  December 31,  2000,  is $1,080,
for services provided to Concert.

         Included  in access and other  connection  expenses  for the year ended
December 31, 2000, are charges from Concert  representing  costs incurred on our
behalf to connect calls made to foreign  countries  (international  settlements)
and costs paid by AT&T to Concert for  distributing  Concert  products  totaling
$2,364.

         During the first quarter of 2000, AT&T contributed property,  plant and
equipment  of  approximately  $1,600  to  Concert.  AT&T also  loaned  $1,000 to
Concert;  that loan is included within "Other  investments and related advances"
in the accompanying 2000 Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Interest income of $67 was
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2000.

         At December 31, 2000,  AT&T had a floating rate loan payable to Concert
in the amount of $126.  The loan,  which is due on demand,  is included in "Debt
maturing  within  one  year" in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.

related to taxes pursuant to a tax-sharing  agreement between LMG and Broadband.
That agreement existed prior to the TCI merger.

18.  SEGMENT REPORTING

         AT&T's  results  are  segmented  according  to  the way we  manage  our
business: Business Services, Consumer Services, Wireless Services and Broadband.

         Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications
services,  including long distance,  local, and data and Internet  protocol (IP)
networking,   to  small  and   medium-sized   businesses,   large  domestic  and
multinational  businesses and government  agencies.  Business Services is also a
provider  of  voice,  data and IP  transport  to  service  resellers  (wholesale
services). Also included in the Business Services segment is AT&T Solutions, our
outsourcing and network-management business.

         Our  Consumer  Services  segment  provides  a variety  of  any-distance
communications  services,  including long distance, local toll (intrastate calls
outside the immediate local area) and Internet access to residential  customers.
In   addition,   Consumer   Services   provides   prepaid   calling   card   and
operator-handled  calling  services.  Local  phone  service is also  provided in
certain areas.
<PAGE>

         Our Wireless  Services  segment offers wireless voice and data services
and products to customers in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and 1900  megahertz
(Personal  Communications  Services,  or PCS)  markets.  Wireless  Services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the  United  States  and  internationally,  aviation-communications
services  and  fixed  wireless  services.  Fixed  wireless  provides  high-speed
Internet  access and  any-distance  voice services using wireless  technology to
residential and small business customers.

         Our Broadband  segment  offers a variety of services  through our cable
broadband network,  including  traditional analog video and new services such as
digital video, high-speed data and broadband telephony.

         The  balance of AT&T's  operations  (excluding  LMG) is  included  in a
"Corporate and Other" category. This category reflects corporate staff functions
and the elimination of transactions between segments,  as well as the results of
Excite@Home and international  operations and ventures.  LMG is not an operating
segment of AT&T because AT&T does not have a controlling  financial  interest in
LMG for financial accounting purposes. Therefore, we account for this investment
under the equity  method.  Additionally,  LMG's  results are not reviewed by the
chief  operating  decision-makers  for purposes of  determining  resources to be
allocated.

         Total assets for our reportable  segments generally include all assets,
except intercompany receivables. However, our Wireless Services segment included
intercompany  receivables  from AT&T and the related interest income since these
assets  relate to the  results  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracked  business.
Prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally
held at the  corporate  level and  therefore,  are included in the Corporate and
Other  category.  Shared  network  assets  are  allocated  to the  segments  and
reallocated  each January based on two years of volumes.  Capital  additions for
each segment include  capital  expenditures  for property,  plant and equipment,
acquisitions of licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in
franchise costs and additions to internal-use software.

         The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant  accounting  policies (see Note 1). AT&T evaluates
performance based on several factors,  of which the primary financial measure is
earnings before interest and taxes,  including pretax minority  interest and net
pretax losses from other equity investments (EBIT).

         Generally,   AT&T  accounts  for  Business  Services'  and  Broadband's
intersegment transactions at market prices.

19.  GUARANTEE OF PREFERRED SECURITIES

TCI Securities:

20.  CONSOLIDATING CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         In  conjunction  with the issuance of AT&T  Wireless  Group and Liberty
Media Group tracking stocks, AT&T has separated for financial reporting purposes
in all  periods  the AT&T  Common  Stock  Group,  Liberty  Media  Group and AT&T
Wireless Group. Below is the consolidating  financial information reflecting the
businesses of these  individual  groups,  including  the  allocation of expenses
between the groups in accordance with our allocation policies,  as well as other
related party transactions such as sales of services between groups and interest
income and  expense on  intercompany  borrowings.  The AT&T  Common  Stock Group
presented  below  excludes  its retained  portion of the value of AT&T  Wireless
Group. AT&T does not have a controlling  financial interest in LMG for financial
accounting  purposes;  therefore,  our  ownership  in  LMG  is  reflected  as an
investment accounted for under the equity method and is reflected as such in the
consolidating financial statements below.

         AT&T Wireless Group,  purchases long distance and other network-related
services  from AT&T at  market-based  prices and  accordingly  such  amounts are
eliminated.  Prior to the offering of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking  stock,  the
capital  structure of AT&T  Wireless  Group had been  assumed  based upon AT&T's
historical capital ratio adjusted for certain items. Intercompany interest rates
are  intended to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rate that AT&T
Wireless  Group  would be able to obtain  or  receive  if it were a  stand-alone
entity.  General corporate overhead related to AT&T's corporate headquarters and
common support  divisions has been allocated to AT&T Wireless Group based on the
ratio  of  AT&T  Wireless   Group's   external  costs  and  expenses  to  AT&T's
consolidated  external costs and expenses,  adjusted for any functions that AT&T
Wireless  Group  performs on its own.  The  consolidated  income tax  provision,
related tax  payments or refunds,  and  deferred  tax balances of AT&T have been
alloated to AT&T Wireless Group based  principally on the taxable income and tax
credits directly attributable to AT&T Wireless Group.

         Pursuant to the Inter-Group  agreement,  AT&T does not allocate general
overhead expenses to Libery Media Group and only charges Liberty Media Group for
specific  services  that  Liberty  Media Group  receives  from AT&T  pursuant to
service agreements or similar arrangements. Additionally, as Liberty Media Group
operates independent of AT&T, there is no cash or debt allocated to them.

22.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities."
Among other provisions,  it requires that entities  recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial  position and measure
those instruments at fair value.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The effective date
for this  standard was delayed via the  issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective
date for SFAS No. 133 is now for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2000,
though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.
For AT&T,  this means that the standard must be adopted no later than January 1,
2001.

         In June 2000,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  138,  "Accounting  for Certain
Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," as an amendment to SFAS
No.  133.  This  statement   provides   clarification  with  regard  to  certain
implementation issues under SFAS No. 133 on specific types of hedges.

         On January 1, 2001, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 133. We recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$1,370  of  income,  or  approximately   $0.34  per  diluted  share,   primarily
attributable  to fair value  adjustments of debt  instruments,  including  those
acquired in  conjunction  with the  MediaOne  merger,  as well as to our warrant
portfolio.  In  addition,  in  connection  with the adoption of SFAS No. 133, we
reclassified certain investment  securities,  which support debt that is indexed
to   those   securities,    from   "available-for-sale"   to   "trading."   This
reclassification  resulted  in  the  recognition  of  a  charge  of  $1,724,  or
approximately  $0.43 per  diluted  share,  net of  applicable  taxes,  which was
recorded as a  reduction  of other  income.  As  available-for-sale  securities,
changes in fair value were previously included within other comprehensive income
as a component of shareowners'  equity.  In addition,  LMG recorded a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of applicable income taxes, of approximately
$800 of income, or approximately $0.31 per share.

         The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138,
on AT&T's future  results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of our
derivatives  and related  financial  instruments  and could result in pronounced
quarterly fluctuations in other income in future periods.

         In  September  2000,  the FASB  issued SFAS No.  140,  "Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities
- -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." This statement provides  accounting
and reporting  standards  for  transfers  and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of  liabilities.  Under  these  standards,  after a transfer of
financial  assets,  an entity  recognizes the financial and servicing  assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when
control has been surrendered,  and derecognizes  liabilities when  extinguished.
This statement provides  consistent  standards for  distinguishing  transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. This
statement is  effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of liabilities  occurring  after March 31, 2001.  AT&T does not
expect that the  adoption of SFAS No. 140 will have a material  impact on AT&T's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

23.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         On January 12, 2001,  AT&T announced that Cox and Comcast had exercised
their  rights to sell a combined  total of 60.4  million  shares of  Excite@Home
Series A common stock to AT&T as part of an  agreement  announced in August 2000
to  reorganize  Excite@Home's  governance.  Cox and  Comcast  elected to receive
shares of AT&T common stock in exchange for their  Excite@Home  shares.  AT&T is
currently in discussions  to renegotiate  the terms of the put options which may
result in a change to the number of shares of AT&T  stock  that Cox and  Comcast
will receive, as well as the number of Excite@Home Shares, if any AT&T receives.
There  can be no  assurance  that an  agreement  will be  reached  with  Cox and
Comcast.

         On  January  22,  2001,  AT&T  and NTT  DoCoMo  (DoCoMo)  finalized  an
agreement whereby DoCoMo invested  approximately $9.8 billion for a new class of
AT&T  preferred  stock,   termed  DoCoMo  Wireless   tracking  stock,   that  is
economically  equivalent to 406 million  shares of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking
stock and reflects  approximately 16% of the financial  performance and economic
value of AT&T Wireless  Group.  AT&T  allocated  $6.2 billion of the proceeds to
AT&T Wireless Group. Each share of DoCoMo Wireless tracking stock is convertible
at any time into AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock.  Upon the conversion of the
DoCoMo Wireless  tracking  stock,  AT&T will reduce its portion of the financial
performance and economic value in AT&T Wireless Group by 178 million shares, and
the balance of the 406 million shares will come from the issuance of 228 million
new shares of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock. Additionally,  upon completion
of the planned  split-off of AT&T Wireless,  the DoCoMo Wireless  tracking stock
and related  warrants will  automatically  be converted into AT&T Wireless Group
tracking stock and thereafter be exchanged on the same terms as all other shares
of AT&T Wireless Group  tracking stock in the split-off.  In the event that AT&T
has not split-off AT&T Wireless by specified  dates  beginning  January 1, 2002,
DoCoMo will have the right, at its election,  to require AT&T to repurchase from
DoCoMo  the  preferred  shares  initially  issued to them at  DoCoMo's  original
purchase price plus interest up to the date of payment.  The interest under this
right will be treated as preferred stock  dividends,  with charges recorded as a
reduction of AT&T Common Stock Group  earnings.  In  addition,  DoCoMo  acquired
five-year  warrants to purchase the  equivalent  of an  additional  41.7 million
shares of AT&T Wireless Group  tracking  stock at $35 per share.  As part of the
agreement,  DoCoMo  obtained  a seat on AT&T's  board of  directors  until  AT&T
Wireless Group is split-off  from AT&T as a separate  public  company,  which is
expected to occur later in 2001. At that time, DoCoMo will retain representation
on the new public AT&T Wireless board.  Receipt of the DoCoMo  proceeds  reduced
AT&T's existing $25 billion credit facility by $1.8 billion.

         In January  2001,  AT&T entered into  agreements  with certain  network
equipment  vendors,  which  extend  through  2004,  to purchase  next-generation
wireless network equipment for a total of approximately $1.8 billion.

         On February 27, 2001,  AT&T  entered  into an agreement  with  Vodafone
Group plc to sell our 10% stake in Japan Telecom Co. Ltd for approximately $1.35
billion in cash.  The  transaction is expected to be completed in April 2001 and
will result in a gain.

         On March 1, 2001, AT&T Wireless  completed a private  placement of $6.5
billion in notes.  The notes pay  interest at rates  ranging from 7.35% to 8.75%
per annum,  with  maturity  dates  ranging from 2006 to 2031.  The notes include
customary  covenants  and  registration  rights.  As a result of the issuance of
these notes,  AT&T's  existing $25 billion  credit  facility was reduced by $4.8
billion.
<PAGE>

         On March 23, 2001, AT&T Wireless entered into $2.5 billion in revolving
credit facilities. The facilities consist of a 364-day facility of $1.25 billion
and a five-year  revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion.  The facilities may
be used for general  corporate  purposes and are subject to customary  covenants
and events of default.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
         FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

         There  have  been  no  changes  in  independent   accountants   and  no
disagreements   with  independent   accountants  on  any  matter  of  accounting
principles or practices,  financial statement  disclosure,  or auditing scope or
procedure during the last two years.

        1999. The increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2000
        was primarily due to the  consolidation  of At Home  Corporation and the
        merger with MediaOne Group,  Inc. The increase in 1999 was primarily due
        to the merger with  Tele-Communications,  Inc. These increases are shown
        within the charged to costs and expenses column.

amended  pursuant  to  authority  vested  in  the  Board  of  Directors  by  the
Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation,  as heretofore amended,  and in

         the State of New York entitled `An Act to provide for the incorporation
         and regulation of telegraph  companies,' passed April 12, 1848, and the
         various acts amendatory thereof or supplemental  thereto; and of having
         and exercising all and every of the powers, privileges,  franchises and

         requirements of the various acts aforesaid,  and for the purposes above
         set forth, we do hereby declare and certify as follows,

                  "FIRST.  The name assumed to distinguish  such association and
         to be used in its dealings, and by which it may sue and be sued, is the

                  "SECOND.  The general  route of the lines of telegraph of said

         and convenient ways or courses, leading thence to the cities of Albany,
         Boston,  and the  intermediate  cities,  towns and places,  also from a
         point or points in and through the city of New York, and thence through
         and across  the  Hudson  and East  rivers and the bay and harbor of New
         York, to Jersey City, Long Island City and Brooklyn, and along all rail
         roads, bridges, highways and other practicable, suitable and convenient
         ways and courses to the cities of Philadelphia,  Baltimore, Washington,
         Richmond,  Charleston,  Mobile and New Orleans, and to all intermediate

<PAGE>
         City, San Francisco and Portland, and to all intermediate cities, towns
         and places, and also along all rail roads, bridges,  highways and other
         practicable,  suitable  and  convenient  ways  and  courses  as  may be
         necessary or proper for the purpose of  connecting  with each other one
         or more  points in said city of New  York,  and in each of the  cities,
         towns and places hereinabove specifically or generally designated.

                  "And it is further  declared  and  certified  that the general
         route  of  the  lines  of  this  association,   in  addition  to  those
         hereinbefore  described or designated,  will connect one or more points
         in each and every city, town or place in the State of New York with one
         or more  points in each and  every  other  city,  town or place in said
         State, and in each and every other of the United States,  and in Canada
         and Mexico,  and each and every of said cities,  towns and places is to
         be  connected  with each and every  other  city,  town or place in said

         with the rest of the known world as may hereafter  become  necessary or
         desirable in conducting the business of this association.

                  "THIRD.  The aggregate  number of shares which the corporation
         is  authorized  to  issue  is  1,600,000,000   shares,   consisting  of
         1,500,000,000  common  shares  having a par  value of $1 pre  share and

                  "The  preferred  shares may be issued from time to time in one

         shall be  entitled  to receive  upon the  liquidation,  dissolution  or
         winding up of the  corporation,  which  amounts may vary  depending  on
         whether  such  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up is voluntary or
         involuntary and, if voluntary, may vary at different dates;

                  "(d) whether or not the shares of such series shall be subject
         to the operation of a purchase,  retirement or sinking fund and, if so,
         the extent to and manner n which such  purchase,  retirement or sinking
         fund shall be applied to the  purchase or  redemption  of the shares of
         such series for  retirement  or for other  corporate  purposes  and the
         terms and  provisions  relative  to the  operation  of the said fund or
         funds;

                  "(e)  whether  or not the  shares  of  such  series  shall  be
         convertible  into or  exchangeable  for  shares of any  other  class or
         series  and,  if so,  the  price  or  prices  or the  rate or  rates of
         conversion or exchange and the method, if any, of adjusting the same;

                  "(f) the  restrictions,  if any, upon the payment of dividends
         or making of other  distributions  on, and upon the  purchase  or other
         acquisition of, common shares;
<PAGE>
                  "(g)  the   restrictions,   if  any,   upon  the  creation  of
         indebtedness,  and the  restrictions,  if any,  upon  the  issue of any
         additional  shares  ranking on a parity  with or prior to the shares of
         such  series  in  addition  to the  restrictions  provided  for in this
         Article Third;

                  "(h) the voting  powers,  if any, of the shares of such series
         in addition to the voting  powers  provided for in this Article  Third;
         and

                  "(i) such other rights,  preferences  and limitations as shall
not be inconsistent with this Article Third.

"All shares of any particular  series shall rank equally and be identical in all
respects  except that  shares of any one series  issued at  different  times may
differ as to the date from which dividends shall be cumulative.

property  or  assets  of the  corporation  or a  consolidation  or merger of the
corporation with one or more other corporations  (whether or not the corporation
is the corporation  surviving such  consolidation or merger) shall not be deemed
to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

         "The  aggregate  amount which all preferred  shares  outstanding at any
time shall be entitled to receive on  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or
winding up shall not exceed $8,000,000,000.

shall be in default in an  aggregate  amount  equivalent  to six full  quarterly
dividends on any series of preferred shares at the time outstanding,  the number
of directors then  constituting the Board of Directors of the corporation  shall
ipso facto be increased by two, and the outstanding  preferred  shares shall, in
addition to any other voting rights, have the exclusive right, voting separately
as a class  and  without  regard  to  series,  to  elect  two  directors  of the
corporation  to fill such  newly  created  directorships  and such  right  shall
continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on all preferred shares to
the latest dividend  payment date shall have been paid or declared and set apart
for payment.

voting or other rights of shares of such series, shall have, as such holder, any
preemptive  right  to  purchase  any  other  shares  of the  corporation  or any
securities  convertible  into or  entitling  the holder to  purchase  such other

retire  preferred  shares  are not paid in full in the case of all  series  with
respect to which such requirements  exist, the number of shares to be retired in
each series shall be in  proportion  to the  respective  amounts  which would be
payable on account of such  requirements  if all  amounts  payable  were paid in
full.

By-Laws.

         "FIFTH.  The duration of the corporation shall be perpetual.

any of its  shareholders  for  damages  for any  breach  of duty as a  director;
provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit (i)
the liability of a director if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to
him or her  establishes  that his or her acts or omissions  were in bad faith or
involved intentional  misconduct or a knowing violation of law or that he or she
personally  gained in fact a financial  profit or other advantage to which he or
she was not legally entitled or that his or her acts violated Section 719 of the
New York Business  Corporation  Law; or (ii) the liability of a director for any
act or omission prior to the adoption of this Article NINTH by the  shareholders
of the Corporation.

         businesses,  assets and liabilities  comprising the Liberty Media Group
         are owned  directly or  indirectly  by the issuer of the shares of such
         class of  common  stock  and if prior  to such  transaction  all of the
         businesses,  assets and liabilities  comprising the Liberty Media Group
         were  held,   directly  or  indirectly,   by  one  or  more  Qualifying
         Subsidiaries of the  corporation (or by Subsidiaries  that are not held
         directly by the  corporation  but would be Qualifying  Subsidiaries  if

         assets or liabilities,  then  immediately  following such  transaction,
         such  businesses,  assets and liabilities  comprising the Liberty Media
         Group are owned,  directly  or  indirectly,  by one or more  Qualifying
         Subsidiaries  of the issuer of the shares of such class of common stock
         (or by  Subsidiaries  of such issuer that are not held directly by such

         convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Liberty Media Group
         Common Stock) immediately prior to such transaction.

         (c) If the corporation shall in any manner subdivide (by stock split or
otherwise)  or combine (by reverse  stock split or  otherwise)  the  outstanding
shares of Common  Stock or Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock,  or pay a stock
dividend  in shares of any class to  holders  of that  class or shall  otherwise
effect a share  distribution  (as defined in  paragraph 4 of this Part B of this
Article  Third) of Common  Stock or Liberty  Media Group Common  Stock,  the per
share voting rights  specified in paragraph  1(a) of this Part B of this Article
Third of Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock  relative to Common  Stock shall be
appropriately  adjusted  so as to avoid any  dilution  in the  aggregate  voting
rights of any class.

2.       Conversion Rights of Liberty Media Group Common Stock.

         Each  share  of Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  shall be
convertible,  at the  option of the  holder  thereof,  into one share of Class A
Liberty Media Group Common  Stock.  Any such  conversion  may be effected by any
holder of Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock by surrendering such holder's
certificate or certificates  for the Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock to
be converted,  duly endorsed,  at the office of the  corporation or any transfer
agent for the Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  together with a written
notice to the  corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert all
or a  specified  number of shares of Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock
represented  by such  certificate  and  stating  the name or names in which such
holder desires the certificate or  certificates  for Class A Liberty Media Group
Common Stock to be issued.  If so required by the  corporation,  any certificate
for shares  surrendered  for  conversion  shall be accompanied by instruments of
transfer,  in form satisfactory to the corporation,  duly executed by the holder
of such shares or the duly authorized  representative  of such holder.  Promptly
thereafter,  the  corporation  shall  issue and  deliver to such  holder or such
holder's  nominee or nominees,  a certificate or certificates  for the number of
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock to which such holder shall be
entitled as herein  provided.  Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
at the close of business on the date of receipt by the  corporation  or any such
transfer  agent of the  certificate  or  certificates,  notice and, if required,
instruments of transfer referred to above, and the person or persons entitled to
receive the Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock issuable on such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record  holder or holders of such Class
A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock on that date. A number of shares of Class A
Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  equal to the  number  of shares of Class B
Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock  outstanding  from time to time shall be set
aside and  reserved for issuance  upon  conversion  of shares of Class B Liberty
Media Group  Common  Stock.  Shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock
shall not be  convertible  into  shares of Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Common
Stock.

3.       Dividends.

available  therefor and (ii) the Liberty Media Group Available  Dividend Amount.
Subject to paragraph 4 of this Part B of this Article Third, whenever a dividend

Stock a dividend  per share equal to the  dividend per share paid to the holders
of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  and whenever a dividend is paid to
the holders of Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  the corporation  shall
also pay to the holders of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock a dividend
per share equal to the dividend per share paid to the holders of Class B Liberty
Media Group Common Stock.

         (c) Discrimination Between or Among Classes of Common Shares. The Board
of Directors, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of this Part
B of this Article Third, shall have the sole authority and discretion to declare
<PAGE>
and pay dividends on (i) the Common Stock, (ii) any other class of common shares

         Convertible   Securities   are   convertible  or  for  which  they  are
         exercisable  or  exchangeable)  do not differ in any respect other than
         their relative  voting rights and related  differences in  designation,
         conversion,  redemption and share distribution provisions, with holders
         of shares of Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock  receiving  the
         class or series  having  the higher  relative  voting  rights  (without

         constitute  capital  stock of a  Subsidiary  of the  corporation,  such
         rights  shall not  differ to a greater  extent  than the  corresponding
         differences in voting rights, designation,  conversion,  redemption and
         share  distribution  provisions between the Class A Liberty Media Group
         Common  Stock and the Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock,  and

5.       Redemption  and Other Provisions  Relating to  the Liberty  Media Group
Common Stock.

         (a) Redemption in Exchange for Stock of Qualifying Subsidiaries. At any
time at which all of the assets and  liabilities  included in the Liberty  Media
Group are held directly or indirectly by one or more Qualifying  Subsidiaries of
the corporation  that hold no other material assets or liabilities (the "Liberty
Media  Group  Subsidiaries"),  the  Board  of  Directors  may,  subject  to  the
availability of assets of the corporation legally available therefor, redeem, on
a pro rata basis,  all of the outstanding  shares of Class A Liberty Media Group
Common  Stock and Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock in exchange for an
aggregate number of outstanding  fully paid and  nonassessable  shares of common
stock of a Liberty Media Group  Subsidiary  that is the beneficial  owner of all
other Liberty Media Group Subsidiaries (or, if applicable, of each Liberty Media
Group  Subsidiary  that is not a Subsidiary  of one or more other  Liberty Media
Group Subsidiaries) equal to the number of outstanding shares of common stock of
such Liberty Media Group Subsidiary (or Liberty Media Group Subsidiaries, as the
case may be) held by the corporation;  provided that no such redemption pursuant
to this paragraph 5(a) of this Part B of this Article Third may occur unless the
redemption  is  tax-free  to the holders of Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock
(except  with  respect to cash  received by such  holders in lieu of  fractional
shares).  Any such  redemption  shall occur on a Redemption  Date set forth in a
notice  to  holders  of Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock and Class B
Liberty Media Group Common Stock and Convertible  Securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable  for shares of either such series (unless  provision
for  notice  is  otherwise  made  pursuant  to the  terms  of  such  Convertible
Securities)  pursuant to paragraph 5(d)(v) of this Part B of this Article Third.
In effecting such a redemption,  the corporation  shall (i) if and to the extent
practicable, redeem shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock and Class
B Liberty Media Group Common Stock in exchange for shares of separate classes or
series of common  stock of each Liberty  Media Group  Subsidiary  with  relative
voting rights and related differences in designation, conversion, redemption and
share distribution provisions not greater than the corresponding  differences in
voting  rights,  designation,  conversion,  redemption  and  share  distribution
provisions  between  the Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock and Class B
Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock,  with  holders of shares of Class B Liberty
Media  Group  Common  Stock  receiving  the class or series  having  the  higher
relative  voting rights,  and (ii) to the extent  redemption in accordance  with
clause  (i) above is not  practicable,  redeem  shares of Class A Liberty  Media
Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock in exchange for
shares of a single class of common stock of each Liberty Media Group  Subsidiary
without distinction between the shares distributed to the holders of the Class A
Liberty Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock.

         (b) Mandatory  Dividend or Redemption in Case of Disposition of Liberty
Media Group Assets.  In the event of the  Disposition,  in one  transaction or a
series of related  transactions,  by the corporation and its subsidiaries of all
or substantially  all of the properties and assets of the Liberty Media Group to
one or more Persons or groups (other than (w) in connection with the Disposition
by the  corporation  of all of the  corporation's  properties  and assets in one
<PAGE>
transaction  or  a  series  of  related  transactions  in  connection  with  the
liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of
paragraph  6 of  this  Part B of  this  Article  Third,  (x) a  dividend,  other
distribution  or  redemption  in  accordance  with any provision of paragraph 3,
paragraph 4, paragraph 5(a) or paragraph 6 of this Part B of this Article Third,
(y)  to any  Person  or  group  which  the  Liberty  Media  Group,  directly  or
indirectly,  after  giving  effect  to the  Disposition,  controls  and which is
included in the Liberty Media Group or (z) in connection with a Related Business
Transaction),  the  corporation  shall,  on or  prior to the  85th  Trading  Day
following the consummation of such Disposition, either:

(i)      subject to paragraph 3(b) of this Part B of this Article Third, declare
         and pay a  dividend  in cash  and/or in  securities  or other  property
         (determined as provided below) to the holders of the outstanding shares
         of Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty  Media
         Group Common Stock  equally on a share for share basis  (subject to the
         last  sentence of this  paragraph5  (b) of this Part B of this  Article
         Third),  in an aggregate  amount  equal to the Liberty  Media Group Net
         Proceeds  of  such  Disposition  (provided  that  if  such  Disposition
         involves  all (not  merely  substantially  all) of the  properties  and
         assets of the Liberty Media Group,  then the  aggregate  amount of such
         dividend  shall  equal the  product  of the  Liberty  Media  Group Full
         Dilution  Fraction  and the Liberty  Media  Group Net  Proceeds of such
         Disposition  and the  difference  between the aggregate  amount of such
         dividend and such Liberty Media Group Net Proceeds shall be reserved by
         the  corporation  for  payment or  delivery  to  holders of  Pre-Merger
         Convertible Securities on conversion, exercise or exchange thereof); or

(ii)     provided  that there are assets of the  corporation  legally  available
         therefor and to the extent the Liberty Media Group  Available  Dividend
         Amount  would have been  sufficient  to pay a dividend in lieu  thereof
         pursuant  to clause (i) of this  paragraph  5(b) of this Part B of this
         Article Third, then:

                  (A) if such Disposition involves all (not merely substantially
         all) of the  properties  and assets of the Liberty Media Group,  redeem
         all outstanding  shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock and
         Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock in exchange for cash and/or
         securities  or other  property  (determined  as  provided  below) in an
         aggregate  amount equal to the product of the Liberty  Media Group Full
         Dilution  Fraction  and the  Liberty  Media  Group Net  Proceeds,  such
         aggregate amount to be allocated  (subject to the last sentence of this
         paragraph 5(b) of this Part B of this Article Third) to shares of Class
         A Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock and Class B Liberty  Media Group
         Common  Stock in the ratio of the number of shares of each such  series
         outstanding  (so  that  the  amount  of  consideration   paid  for  the
         redemption  of each share of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock
         and each  share of Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock is the
         same); or

                  (B) if such Disposition  involves  substantially  all (but not
         all) of the properties and assets of the Liberty Media Group,  apply an
         aggregate   amount  of  cash  and/or   securities  or  other   property
         (determined  as provided  below)  equal to the Liberty  Media Group Net
         Proceeds to the  redemption  of  outstanding  shares of Class A Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock,
         such aggregate amount to be allocated  (subject to the last sentence of
         this  paragraph 5(b) of this Part B of this Article Third) to shares of
         Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock and Class B Liberty  Media
<PAGE>
         Group  Common  Stock in the ratio of the  number of shares of each such
         series outstanding,  and the number of shares of each such series to be
         redeemed to equal the lesser of (x) the whole number nearest the number
         determined  by  dividing  the  aggregate  amount  so  allocated  to the
         redemption  of such series by the average  Market Value of one share of
         Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock  during the  ten-Trading  Day
         period  beginning on the 16th Trading Day following the consummation of
         such   Disposition  and  (y)  the  number  of  shares  of  such  series
         outstanding  (so  that  the  amount  of  consideration   paid  for  the
         redemption  of each share of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock
         and each  share of Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock is the
         same);

such redemption to be effected in accordance  with the applicable  provisions of
paragraph 5(d) of this Part B of this Article Third;

For purposes of this paragraph 5(b):

         (x) as of any date,  "substantially all of the properties and assets of
the Liberty Media Group" shall mean a portion of such properties and assets that
represents at least 80% of the  then-current  market value (as determined by the
Board of Directors) of the  properties  and assets of the Liberty Media Group as
of such date;

         (y) in the case of a Disposition  of properties  and assets in a series
of  related  transactions,  such  Disposition  shall  not be deemed to have been
consummated until the consummation of the last of such transactions; and

         (z) the corporation shall pay the dividend or redemption price referred
to in clause (i) or (ii) of this  paragraph  5(b) of this Part B of this Article
Third in the same form as the proceeds of the Disposition were received.  If the
dividend  or  redemption  price is paid in the form of  securities  of an issuer
other than the corporation,  the corporation shall (1) if more than one class or
series of securities is to be distributed, if and to the extent practicable, pay
the dividend or  redemption  price in the form of separate  classes or series of
securities,  with one class or series of such  securities  to holders of Class A
Liberty  Media Group Common Stock and another  class or series of  securities to
holders  of Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock,  provided  that  such
securities  (and, if such  securities  are  convertible  into or  exercisable or
exchangeable for shares of another class or series of securities, the securities
so issuable  upon such  conversion,  exercise or  exchange) do not differ in any
respect  other than their  relative  voting  rights and related  differences  in
designation,  conversion,  redemption and share  distribution  provisions,  with
holders of shares of Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock  receiving  the
class or series  having the higher  relative  voting rights  (without  regard to
whether such rights differ to a greater or lesser extent than the  corresponding
differences  in voting  rights,  designation,  conversion,  redemption and share
distribution provisions between the Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock and
the Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock),  provided that if such securities
constitute  capital stock of a Subsidiary of the corporation,  such rights shall
not differ to a greater  extent  than the  corresponding  differences  in voting
rights,  designation,  conversion,  redemption and share distribution provisions
between the Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty  Media
Group Common Stock,  and otherwise  such  securities  shall be distributed on an
equal per share basis, and (2) otherwise pay the dividend or redemption price in
the form of a single class of securities without  distinction between the shares
received by the holders of Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock and Class B
Liberty Media Group Common Stock.
<PAGE>
         (c) Certain Provisions Respecting  Convertible  Securities.  Unless the
provisions of any class or series of Pre-Merger  Convertible  Securities provide
specifically to the contrary, after any Redemption Date on which all outstanding
shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock and Class B Liberty  Media
Group  Common  Stock were  redeemed,  any share of Class A Liberty  Media  Group
Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  that is issued on
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Pre-Merger Convertible Securities shall,
immediately upon issuance pursuant to such conversion,  exercise or exchange and
without  any notice or any other  action on the part of the  corporation  or its
Board of  Directors  or the holder of such share of Class A Liberty  Media Group
Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock,  be  redeemed  in
exchange for the kind and amount of shares of capital  stock,  cash and/or other
securities or property that a holder of such Pre-Merger  Convertible  Securities
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of such securities had
such terms  provided  that the  conversion,  exercise or exchange  privilege  in
effect  immediately  prior to any such redemption of all  outstanding  shares of
Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Common
Stock would be adjusted  so that the holder of any such  Pre-Merger  Convertible
Securities thereafter surrendered for conversion,  exercise or exchange would be
entitled to receive the kind and amount of shares of capital stock,  cash and/or
other securities or property such holder would have received as a result of such
redemption  had  such  securities   been   converted,   exercised  or  exchanged
immediately  prior  thereto.  Unless  the  provisions  of any class or series of
Convertible Securities (other than Pre-Merger Convertible  Securities) which are
or become  convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A
Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock
provide  specifically  to the contrary,  after any Redemption  Date on which all
outstanding  shares  of Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock and Class B
Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock were  redeemed,  any share of Class A Liberty
Media Group  Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock that is
issued on conversion,  exercise or exchange of any such  Convertible  Securities
shall,  immediately  upon  issuance  pursuant  to such  conversion,  exercise or
exchange  and  without  any  notice  or any  other  action  on the  part  of the
corporation  or its Board of  Directors  or the  holder of such share of Class A
Liberty Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock, be
redeemed in exchange  for, to the extent assets of the  corporation  are legally
available therefor, the amount of $.01 per share in cash.

         Securities)  and (E) in the case of a notice to holders of  Convertible
         Securities (other than Pre-Merger Convertible Securities),  a statement
         to the effect  that  holders of such  Convertible  Securities  shall be
         entitled  to  participate  in such  redemption  only  if  such  holders
         appropriately convert, exercise or exchange such Convertible Securities
         on or prior to the  Redemption  Date  referred to in clause (B) of this
         sentence and a statement as to what, if anything, such holders shall be

         such holder's  address as the same appears on the transfer books of the
         corporation.

                  (vi)  Neither the failure to mail any notice  required by this
         paragraph 5(d) to any particular  holder of Class A Liberty Media Group
         Common  Stock,   Class  B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  or  of
         Convertible   Securities  nor  any  defect  therein  shall  affect  the
         sufficiency  thereof with  respect to any other  holder of  outstanding
         shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock or Class B Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock or of Convertible Securities,  or the validity
         of any redemption.

                  (vii)  The  corporation  shall  not be  required  to  issue or
         deliver  fractional  shares  of  any  class  of  capital  stock  or any
         fractional  securities  to any  holder of Class A Liberty  Media  Group
         Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  upon any
         redemption,  dividend or other distribution  pursuant to this paragraph
         5. In connection with the  determination of the number of shares of any
         class  of  capital  stock  that  shall be  issuable  or the  amount  of
         securities  that shall be  deliverable to any holder of record upon any
         such  redemption,   dividend  or  other  distribution   (including  any
         fractions of shares or  securities),  the corporation may aggregate the
         number of shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock or Class B
         Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock held at the  relevant  time by such
         holder of record. If the number of shares of any class of capital stock
         or the amount of securities  remaining to be issued or delivered to any
         holder of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock or Class B Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock is a fraction,  the corporation shall, if such
         fraction  is  not  issued  or  delivered  to  such  holder,  pay a cash
         adjustment  in respect of such  fraction in an amount equal to the fair
         market  value of such  fraction  on the fifth  Trading Day prior to the
         date such payment is to be made (without interest). For purposes of the
         preceding sentence, "fair market value" of any fraction shall be (A) in
         the  case  of  any  fraction  of  a  share  of  capital  stock  of  the
<PAGE>
         corporation,  the product of such  fraction and the Market Value of one
         share of such capital stock and (B) in the case of any other fractional
         security, such value as is determined by the Board of Directors.

                  (viii) No  adjustments  in respect of dividends  shall be made
         upon the redemption of any shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common
         Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock;  provided,  however,
         that if the  Redemption  Date with respect to the Class A Liberty Media
         Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock shall be
         subsequent  to the record  date for the  payment of a dividend or other
         distribution  thereon or with respect thereto, the holders of shares of
         Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group
         Common  Stock at the close of  business  on such  record  date shall be
         entitled to receive the  dividend or other  distribution  payable on or
         with  respect  to such  shares  on the  date  set for  payment  of such
         dividend or other distribution,  notwithstanding the redemption of such
         shares or the  corporation's  default  in payment  of the  dividend  or
         distribution due on such date.

                  (ix)  Before  any  holder of  shares of Class A Liberty  Media
         Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock shall be
         entitled  to receive  certificates  representing  shares of any kind of
         capital  stock  or cash  and/or  securities  or  other  property  to be
         received by such holder with respect to shares of Class A Liberty Media
         Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock pursuant
         to this paragraph 5 of this Part B of this Article  Third,  such holder
         shall  surrender  at  such  place  as  the  corporation  shall  specify
         certificates  for such  shares of Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Common
         Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock, properly endorsed or
         assigned  for  transfer  (unless  the  corporation   shall  waive  such
         requirement).  The corporation  shall as soon as practicable after such
         surrender of certificates  representing shares of Class A Liberty Media
         Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock deliver
         to the person for whose  account  shares of Class A Liberty Media Group
         Common  Stock or Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  were so
         surrendered, or to the nominee or nominees of such person, certificates
         representing the number of whole shares of the kind of capital stock or
         cash and/or  securities or other property to which such person shall be
         entitled  as  aforesaid,  together  with  any  payment  for  fractional
         securities  contemplated by paragraph  5(d)(vii) of this Part B of this
         Article Third.  If less than all of the shares of Class A Liberty Media
         Group  Common  Stock  or  Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock
         represented by any one certificate are to be redeemed,  the corporation
         shall  issue and  deliver a new  certificate  for the shares of Class A
         Liberty  Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common
         Stock not redeemed. The corporation shall not be required to register a
         transfer of any shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock or
         Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  selected  or  called  for
         redemption.

                  (x) From and after any applicable  Redemption Date, all rights
         of a holder of shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock or
         Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock that were redeemed shall cease
         except for the right,  upon surrender of the certificates  representing
         shares of Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock or Class B Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock, to receive  certificates  representing shares
         of the kind and amount of capital  stock or cash and/or  securities  or
         other property for which such shares were  redeemed,  together with any
         payment for fractional  securities  contemplated by paragraph 5(d)(vii)
<PAGE>
         of this Part B of this  Article  Third and such  holder  shall  have no
         other or  further  rights in  respect  of the shares of Class A Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock so
         redeemed, including, but not limited to, any rights with respect to any
         cash,  securities or other  properties  which are reserved or otherwise
         designated by the corporation as being held for the satisfaction of the
         corporation's  obligations  to pay or deliver any cash,  securities  or
         other  property  upon  the  conversion,  exercise  or  exchange  of any
         Convertible  Securities  that were  convertible  into or exercisable or
         exchangeable  for Class A Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock or Class B
         Liberty Media Group Common Stock and outstanding as of the date of such
         redemption.  No holder of a certificate that,  immediately prior to the
         applicable  Redemption  Date for the Class A Liberty Media Group Common
         Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  represented  shares
         of Class A Liberty  Media Group Common  Stock or Class B Liberty  Media
         Group  Common  Stock shall be entitled to receive any dividend or other
         distribution  with respect to shares of any kind of capital  stock into
         or in exchange  for which the Class A Liberty  Media Group Common Stock
         or  Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock  was  redeemed  until
         surrender  of  such  holder's   certificate   for  a   certificate   or
         certificates  representing  shares of such kind of capital stock.  Upon
         such  surrender,  there  shall be paid to the  holder the amount of any
         dividends or other  distributions  (without interest) which theretofore
         became payable with respect to a record date after the Redemption  Date
         but that were not paid by reason of the foregoing,  with respect to the
         number of whole shares of the kind of capital stock  represented by the
         certificate or certificates issued upon such surrender.  From and after
         a Redemption  Date for any shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common
         Stock or Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock,  the  corporation
         shall,  however,  be entitled to treat the  certificates  for shares of
         Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group
         Common  Stock  that have not yet been  surrendered  for  redemption  as
         evidencing  the  ownership of the number of whole shares of the kind or
         kinds of capital  stock for which the  shares of Class A Liberty  Media
         Group  Common  Stock  or  Class B  Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock
         represented   by  such   certificates   shall   have   been   redeemed,
         notwithstanding the failure to surrender such certificates.

                  (xi) The corporation shall pay any and all documentary,  stamp
         or similar  issue or  transfer  taxes that may be payable in respect of
         the issue or  delivery  of any shares of  capital  stock  and/or  other
         securities  on  redemption  of shares of Class A  Liberty  Media  Group
         Common Stock or Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common Stock  pursuant to
         this Part B of this Article Third. The corporation  shall not, however,
         be  required  to pay any tax  that may be  payable  in  respect  of any
         transfer  involved  in the issue and  delivery of any shares of capital
         stock in a name  other than that in which the shares of Class A Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock or Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock so
         redeemed were  registered  and no such issue or delivery  shall be made
         unless  and  until the  person  requesting  such  issue has paid to the
         corporation  the  amount of any such  tax,  or has  established  to the
         satisfaction of the corporation that such tax has been paid.

6.       Liquidation.

         In  the  event  of a  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up of the
corporation,  whether  voluntary or involuntary,  after payment or provision for
payment of the debts and other liabilities of the corporation and subject to the
prior payment in full of the  preferential  amounts to which any class or series
<PAGE>
of Preferred  Stock is  entitled,  (a) the holders of the shares of Common Stock
and (on the basis that may be set forth in this  Certificate with respect to any
such  shares) the holders of any other  class of common  shares  (other than the
Liberty  Media Group Common  Stock) shall share in the aggregate in a percentage
of the  funds  of the  corporation  remaining  for  distribution  to its  common
shareholders equal to 100% multiplied by the average daily ratio (expressed as a
decimal) of X/Z for the 20-Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day prior to
the date of the public announcement of such liquidation,  dissolution or winding
up,  and (b) the  holders of the shares of Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Common
Stock and the holders of the shares of Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock
shall share equally, on a share for share basis, in a percentage of the funds of
the corporation  remaining for distribution to its common  shareholders equal to
100%  multiplied by the average daily ratio  (expressed as a decimal) of Y/Z for
such 20-Trading Day period,  where X is the aggregate Market  Capitalization  of
the Common  Stock and any other class of common  shares  (other than the Liberty
Media Group Common Stock), Y is the aggregate Market Capitalization of the Class
A Liberty  Media Group Common  Stock and the Class B Liberty  Media Group Common
Stock,  and Z is the aggregate  Market  Capitalization  of the Common Stock, any
other class of common shares (other than the Liberty Media Group Common  Stock),
the Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock and the Class B Liberty Media Group
Common Stock.  Neither the  consolidation  or merger of the corporation  with or
into any other  corporation or corporations  nor the sale,  transfer or lease of
all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation shall itself be deemed
to be a  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the  corporation  within the
meaning  of  this   paragraph  6  of  this  Part  B  of  this   Article   Third.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transaction or series of related transactions
which results in all of the assets and liabilities included in the Liberty Media
Group  being  held by one or more  Liberty  Media  Group  Subsidiaries,  and the
distribution  of such Liberty Media Group  Subsidiaries  (and no other  material
assets or  liabilities)  to the holders of the  outstanding  Liberty Media Group
Common  Stock shall not  constitute  a  voluntary  or  involuntary  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation for purposes of this paragraph 6 of
this Part B of this Article  Third,  but shall be subject to  paragraph  5(a) of
this Part B of this Article Third.

7.       Determinations by the Board of Directors.

         Any  determinations  made by the Board of Directors under any provision
in  this  Part B of this  Article  Third  shall  be  final  and  binding  on all
shareholders of the corporation, except as may otherwise be required by law. The
corporation shall prepare a statement of any such  determination by the Board of
Directors  respecting  the  fair  market  value  of any  properties,  assets  or
securities and shall file such statement with the Secretary of the corporation.

8.      Relationship Between the Liberty Media Group and the Common Stock Group.

         (a) In  furtherance  and not in limitation of the provisions of Article

of more than one Group's business and is of practical advantage to more than one
Group),  (ii) to provide  financial  support  to the other  Group (or any member
thereof) or (iii) otherwise to assist the other Group.

         (c) In  furtherance  and not in limitation of the provisions of Article

failure or alleged  failure of such officer or director to offer to (or to cause
the Liberty  Media Group or the Common Stock Group to offer to) either Group any
corporate opportunity of any kind or nature that is pursued by the other Group.

         (d) Nothing in this  paragraph 8 of this Part B of this  Article  Third
shall  prevent any members of the Liberty Media Group from entering into written
agreements  with the Common  Stock Group to define or restrict any aspect of the
relationship between the Groups.

         additional  shares  ranking on a parity  with or prior to the shares of

         not be inconsistent with this Article Third.

         All shares of any particular series shall rank equally and be identical

         Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the
holders of shares of Preferred Stock of such series shall be entitled to receive
the  amounts to which such  holders are  entitled as fixed with  respect to such
series,  including all dividends  accumulated to the date of final distribution,
before any payment or distribution of assets of the corporation shall be made to
or set apart for the holders of common shares and after such payments shall have
been made in full to the holders of shares of  Preferred  Stock,  the holders of
common  shares  shall be entitled to receive any and all assets  remaining to be
paid or distributed to shareholders and the holders of shares of Preferred Stock

all the property or assets of the  corporation or a  consolidation  or merger of
the  corporation  with  one or  more  other  corporations  (whether  or not  the
corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger) shall not
be  deemed  to  be a  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up,  voluntary  or
involuntary.

         The aggregate amount which all shares of Preferred Stock outstanding at
any time shall be entitled to receive on involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up shall not exceed $8,000,000,000.

corporation  will not (a) without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of at  least  66  2/3%  of all  the  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  at  the  time
outstanding,  (i)  authorize  shares  of stock  ranking  prior to the  shares of
Preferred Stock, or (ii) change any provision of this Article Third so to affect
adversely the shares of Preferred  Stock;  (b) without the  affirmative  vote or
consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of any series of  Preferred  Stock at
the time  outstanding,  change  any of the  provisions  of such  series so as to
affect adversely the shares of such series;  (c) without the affirmative vote or
<PAGE>
consent of the  holders of at least a  majority  of all the shares of  Preferred
Stock at the time  outstanding,  (i) increase the authorized number of shares of
Preferred Stock or (ii) increase the authorized number of shares of any class of
stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock.

         Whenever,  at any  time  or  times,  dividends  payable  on  shares  of
Preferred  Stock shall be in default in an aggregate  amount  equivalent  to six
full  quarterly  dividends  on  any  series  of  Preferred  Stock  at  the  time
outstanding, the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors of
the corporation shall ipso facto be increased by two, and the outstanding shares
of Preferred  Stock  shall,  in addition to any other  voting  rights,  have the
exclusive right,  voting  separately as a class and without regard to series, to
elect two directors of the corporation to fill such newly created  directorships
and such right shall  continue  until such time as all dividends  accumulated on
all shares of  Preferred  Stock to the latest  dividend  payment date shall have
been paid or declared and set apart for payment.

         No holder of shares of Preferred  Stock of any series,  irrespective of
any voting or other right of shares of such series,  shall have, as such holder,
any  preemptive  right to purchase  any other shares of the  corporation  or any
securities  convertible  into or  entitling  the holder to  purchase  such other
shares.

         If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any  requirements to
retire shares of Preferred  Stock are not paid in full in the case of all series
with  respect  to which  such  requirements  exist,  the  number of shares to be
retired in each series shall be in  proportion to the  respective  amounts which
would be payable on account of such  requirements  if all amounts  payable  were
paid in full.

                                      ****

                  FOURTH:  The manner in which the  foregoing  amendment of said
         Certificate of  Incorporation  of the corporation was authorized was by
         the vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding  shares of the
         corporation  entitled  to vote  thereon at a meeting  of  shareholders,
         subsequent to the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors.

PART C - Wireless Group Common Stock

1.  Voting Rights.

         (a) Subject to the following  two  sentences  and to paragraph  1(c) of
this Part C of this Article Third,  holders of Wireless Group Common Stock shall
be  entitled  to a number of votes or  fraction of a vote for each share of such
<PAGE>
stock held  (calculated to the nearest 1/10),  on all matters  presented to such
shareholders,  the  numerator  of which shall be the price per share of Wireless
Group Common Stock used in the initial public  offering of Wireless Group Common
Stock and the  denominator of which shall be the average daily Market Value of a
share of Common  Stock  during  the  10-Trading  Day  period  ending on the 20th
Trading Day prior to the effective date of the  registration  statement for such
initial public offering. In the event that AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock is
first distributed without an initial public offering,  holders of Wireless Group
Common  Stock  shall be  entitled to a number of votes or fraction of a vote for
each share of such stock held  (calculated to the nearest 1/10),  on all matters
presented  to such  shareholders,  the  numerator  of which shall be the average
daily  Market  Value  of a share of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock  during  the
10-Trading  Day period  beginning on the 20th Trading Day following such initial
distribution  and the  denominator  of which shall be the average  daily  Market
Value of a share of Common Stock during the 10-Trading  Day period  beginning on
the 20th Trading Day following such initial  distribution.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if the fraction  resulting from the applicable  formula set forth in
the preceding  two  sentences is greater than 0.8 and less than 1.2,  holders of
Wireless Group Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such
stock held, and if the fraction  resulting from the applicable formula set forth
in the preceding two sentences is greater than 0.4 and less than 0.6, holders of
Wireless  Group  Common  Stock  shall be entitled to one-half of a vote for each
share  of such  stock  held,  in  each  case on all  matters  presented  to such
shareholders.

         (b) Except as may otherwise be required by the laws of the State of New
York or, with respect to additional or special voting rights (which may include,
without  limitation,  rights of any such  holders of any such class or series to
elect one or more directors voting separately as a class) of any class or series
of Preferred Stock or any other class of common shares,  in this  Certificate of
Incorporation of the  corporation,  as the same may be amended from time to time
(this  "Certificate")  (including  the terms of the Liberty  Media Group  Common
Stock,  any class or series of Preferred Stock and any resolution or resolutions
providing for the  establishment  of such class or series  pursuant to authority
vested in the Board of Directors by this  Certificate and the terms of any other
class of common shares),  the holders of shares of Common Stock,  the holders of
shares of Wireless Group Common Stock,  the holders of shares of Class A Liberty
Media Group Common  Stock,  the holders of shares of Class B Liberty Media Group
Common  Stock,  the holders of shares of each other class of common  shares,  if
any, entitled to vote thereon, and the holders of shares of each class or series
of Preferred  Stock, if any,  entitled to vote thereon,  shall vote as one class
with respect to all matters to be voted on by shareholders  of the  corporation,
and no separate  vote or consent of the holders of shares of Common  Stock,  the
holders of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock, the holders of shares of Class
A Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock,  the holders of shares of Class B Liberty
Media  Group  Common  Stock or the holders of shares of any such class of common
shares or any such class or series of Preferred  Stock shall be required for the
approval of any such matter,  except,  in the case of Liberty Media Group Common
Stock,  under the  circumstances  described in paragraph  1(b) of Part B of this
Article Third.

         (c) If the corporation shall in any manner subdivide (by stock split or
otherwise)  or combine (by reverse  stock split or  otherwise)  the  outstanding
shares of Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock or Liberty  Media Group
Common Stock,  or pay a stock dividend in shares of any class to holders of that
class or shall otherwise effect a share  distribution (as defined in paragraph 3
of this Part C of this Article  Third) of Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group Common
Stock or Liberty Media Group Common Stock, the per share voting rights of Common
Stock and Liberty Media Group Common Stock specified in paragraph 1(a) of Part B
<PAGE>
of this  Article  Third  and/or the per share  voting  rights of Wireless  Group
Common Stock  specified in paragraph  1(a) of this Part C of this Article  Third
shall be  appropriately  adjusted so as to avoid any  dilution in the  aggregate
voting rights of any one class relative to the other classes.

2.  Dividends.

         (a)  Dividends  on  Common  Stock.  Dividends  on  Common  Stock may be
declared  and paid  only to the  extent  of (i) the  assets  of the  corporation
legally  available  therefor  minus (ii) the sum of (A) the Liberty  Media Group
Available  Dividend  Amount (as defined in paragraph 9 of Part B of this Article
Third),  and (B) the  Wireless  Group  Available  Dividend  Amount  (such amount
available  for the payment of  dividends  on Common Stock is referred to in this
Part  C  of  this  Article  Third  as  the  "Common  Stock  Available   Dividend
Amount(W)").

         (b)  Dividends on Wireless  Group Common  Stock.  Dividends on Wireless
Group  Common  Stock may be declared  and paid only out of the lesser of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the assets of the corporation legally available therefor,
over  (B) the  Liberty  Media  Group  Available  Dividend  Amount,  and (ii) the
Wireless Group Available  Dividend Amount.  Concurrently with the payment of any
dividend on shares of Wireless Group Common Stock,  at the election of the Board
of  Directors,  either (x) the Common  Stock  Group(W)  shall  receive  from the
Wireless  Group an  aggregate  payment of the same kind of cash and/or  property
that is the  subject  of such  dividend,  which  payment  shall  be equal to the
excess,  if any, of (i) the  quotient  obtained by  dividing  (A) the  aggregate
amount of such  dividend,  as determined  by the Board of Directors,  by (B) the
Wireless  Group  Allocation  Fraction,  over (ii) the  aggregate  amount of such
dividend,  as so determined,  or (y) the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction will
be adjusted as described  in  paragraph 9 of this Part C of this Article  Third.
The payment to be made to the Common Stock  Group(W)  pursuant to the  preceding
sentence may, at the  discretion  of the Board of Directors,  be reflected by an
allocation or by a direct transfer of cash or other property.

         (c) Discrimination Between or Among Classes of Common Shares. The Board
of Directors, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of this Part
C of this Article  Third and  paragraph  3(b) of Part B of this  Article  Third,
shall have the sole authority and discretion to declare and pay dividends (or to
refrain from declaring or paying the same)  exclusively to the holders of Common
Stock, exclusively to the holders of Wireless Group Common Stock, exclusively to
the holders of Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  exclusively  to the holders of
any other  class of common  shares or to the  holders of any two or more of such
classes in equal or unequal amounts,  notwithstanding  the relationship  between
the Common Stock  Available  Dividend  Amount(W),  the Wireless Group  Available
Dividend  Amount and the Liberty  Media Group  Available  Dividend  Amount,  the
respective amounts of prior dividends declared on, or the liquidation rights of,
Common Stock,  Wireless  Group Common Stock,  Class A Liberty Media Group Common
Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock, or any other factor.

3.  Share Distributions.

         Subject to the  provisions  of  paragraph  4 of Part B of this  Article
Third,  the corporation may declare and pay a distribution  consisting of shares
of Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group Common Stock or any other  securities  of the
corporation  or  any  other  Person  (hereinafter   sometimes  called  a  "share
distribution") to holders of Common Stock or Wireless Group Common Stock only in
accordance with this paragraph 3 of this Part C of this Article Third.

         (a)  Distributions  on Common  Stock or Wireless  Group  Common  Stock.
Except  as set  forth  in  paragraph  4 of Part B of  this  Article  Third,  the
corporation may declare and pay a share distribution to holders of Common Stock,
Wireless  Group  Common  Stock or any other class of common  shares  (other than
Liberty  Media  Group  Common  Stock)   consisting  of  any  securities  of  the
<PAGE>
corporation,  any Subsidiary of the corporation, or any other Person, including,
without  limitation,  a share distribution  consisting of shares of any class or
series of Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock, Wireless Group Common Stock
or any other class of common  shares  (other  than  Liberty  Media Group  Common
Stock)  (or   Convertible   Securities   convertible   into  or  exercisable  or
exchangeable  for shares of any class or series of Preferred  Stock or shares of
Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group Common Stock or any other class of common shares
(other than Liberty Media Group Common Stock)).

         Concurrently with the making of any share  distribution with respect to
Wireless Group Common Stock,  at the election of the Board of Directors,  either
(x) the Common Stock Group(W) shall receive from the Wireless Group an aggregate
payment of the same kind of property  that is the subject of such  distribution,
which payment shall be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the aggregate amount of such distribution,  as determined by the
Board of Directors, by (B) the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction, over (ii) the
aggregate amount of such dividend,  as so determined,  or (y) the Wireless Group
Allocation Fraction shall be adjusted as described in paragraph 9 of this Part C
of this  Article  Third.  Any  payment to be made to the Common  Stock  Group(W)
pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence  may,  at the  discretion  of the Board of
Directors,  be reflected  by an  allocation  or by a direct  transfer of cash or
other property.

         (b) Discrimination Between or Among Classes of Common Shares. The Board
of Directors,  subject to the foregoing  provisions of this  paragraph 3 of this
Part C of this Article Third and the provisions of paragraph 4 of Part B of this
Article  Third,  shall have the sole authority and discretion to declare and pay
(or to refrain from  declaring or paying)  share  distributions  exclusively  to
holders of Common Stock,  exclusively to holders of Wireless Group Common Stock,
exclusively  to holders of Liberty Media Group Common Stock,  exclusively to the
holders of any other class of common  shares or to holders of any two or more of
such  classes  in equal or unequal  amounts,  notwithstanding  the  relationship
between the Common  Stock  Available  Dividend  Amount(W),  the  Wireless  Group
Available Dividend Amount and the Liberty Media Group Available Dividend Amount,
the  respective  amounts  of  prior  share  distributions  declared  on,  or the
liquidation  rights of,  Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group Common  Stock,  Class A
Liberty Media Group Common Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Common Stock or
any other factor.

4.  Exchange of Wireless Group Common Stock.

         (a)  Exchange at Option of Board of  Directors.  At any time  following
either the  occurrence of a Tax Event or the second  anniversary  of the date of
initial  issuance of any shares of Wireless  Group  Common  Stock (the  "Initial
Issuance Date"),  the Board of Directors,  in its sole  discretion,  may, at any
time, effect a recapitalization of the corporation (a "Board Required Exchange")
by declaring that all of the  outstanding  shares of Wireless Group Common Stock
shall be exchanged  for fully paid and  nonassessable  shares of Common Stock in
accordance  with the Exchange  Rate.  In  addition,  at any time  following  the
Initial Issuance Date, so long as all of the assets and liabilities  included in
the Wireless Group are held,  directly or indirectly,  by one or more Qualifying
Subsidiaries of the corporation  (which shall not include any Subsidiary that is
a part of the Liberty  Media  Group as defined in  paragraph 9 of Part B of this
Article Third) that hold no other material assets or liabilities  (the "Wireless
Group Subsidiaries"), the Board of Directors may, subject to the availability of
assets of the corporation  legally available  therefor,  effect a Board Required
Exchange by exchanging,  on a pro rata basis,  all of the outstanding  shares of
Wireless  Group Common Stock in exchange for an aggregate  number of outstanding
fully  paid and  nonassessable  shares of common  stock of such  Wireless  Group
<PAGE>
Subsidiary or  Subsidiaries  at the applicable  Exchange Rate,  provided that no
such  exchange  may occur  unless  the  exchange  is tax free to the  holders of
Wireless  Group Common Stock  (except with respect to any cash  received by such
holders in lieu of fractional shares).  For purposes of this paragraph 4 of this
Part C of this Article Third,  the term "Exchange  Shares" shall mean the shares
of Common Stock or shares of the one or more Wireless Group Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, into which  shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock may be exchanged
pursuant to a Board Required Exchange.

         (b) Exchange in Connection with Certain  Significant  Transactions.  In
the  event  of a  Disposition  other  than a  Wireless  Group  Related  Business
Transaction   by  the   corporation  in  a  transaction  or  series  of  related
transactions  of all or  substantially  all of the  properties  and  assets  (as
defined  below) of the Wireless  Group to any Person(s) or group(s) of which the
corporation is not a majority owner (whether by merger,  consolidation,  sale of
assets  or  stock,  liquidation,   dissolution,  winding  up  or  otherwise)  (a
"Significant  Transaction"),  effective  upon  the  consummation  of such  sale,
transfer,  assignment or other disposition and automatically  without any action
on the part of the  corporation  or the Board of Directors or on the part of the
holders of shares of Wireless  Group  Common  Stock,  the  corporation  shall be
recapitalized   (a  "Significant   Transaction   Exchange")  by  exchanging  all
outstanding shares of Wireless Group Common Stock for, at the sole discretion of
the Board of Directors, either (i) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock  at the  Exchange  Rate or  (ii)  other  consideration,  as  described  in
paragraph  4(c)  of this  Part C of  this  Article  Third.  Notwithstanding  the
preceding  sentence,  the  corporation  shall be under no obligation to effect a
Significant  Transaction  Exchange that it might otherwise be required to effect
pursuant to such  sentence  (and the  Exchange  Rate shall not apply) if (i) the
underlying Significant Transaction is conditioned upon the affirmative vote of a
majority of the holders of Wireless  Group  Common  Stock,  voting as a separate
class,  (ii)  in  connection  with a  spin-off  or  similar  disposition  of the
corporation's  entire  interest in the Wireless Group to the holders of Wireless
Group Common Stock,  including any such  disposition  that is made in connection
with a Board Required  Exchange,  or (iii) in connection  with the  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary.

         (c) Alternate  Consideration in Connection with Significant Transaction
Exchange.  In  connection  with  any  Significant   Transaction  Exchange,   the
corporation  may, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors,  (i) in lieu
of issuing  shares of Common  Stock in  exchange  for shares of  Wireless  Group
Common Stock, either (x) subject to the limitations  described in paragraph 2(b)
of this Part C of this Article  Third and to the other  provisions  described in
this  paragraph  4(c) of this Part C of this  Article  Third,  declare and pay a
dividend in cash and/or in securities or other property  (determined as provided
below) to holders of the  outstanding  shares of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock
equally on a share for share basis in an aggregate  amount equal to the Wireless
Group Net Proceeds of such Significant  Transaction;  or (y) provided that there
are assets of the corporation  legally available  therefor and to the extent the
Wireless Group  Available  Dividend  Amount would have been  sufficient to pay a
dividend in lieu thereof as described  in clause (x) of this  paragraph  4(c) of
this Part C of this  Article  Third,  then (A) if such  Significant  Transaction
involves the Disposition of all (not merely substantially all) of the properties
and assets of the  Wireless  Group,  redeem all  outstanding  shares of Wireless
Group  Common  Stock in exchange for cash and/or  securities  or other  property
(determined  as provided  below) in an  aggregate  amount  equal to the Wireless
Group  Net  Proceeds;  or (B)  if  such  Significant  Transaction  involves  the
Disposition of  substantially  all (but not all) of the properties and assets of
the Wireless Group, apply an aggregate amount of cash and/or securities or other
property (determined as provided below) equal to the Wireless Group Net Proceeds
<PAGE>
to the  redemption of  outstanding  shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock,  the
number of  shares to be  redeemed  to equal the  lesser of (1) the whole  number
nearest the number  determined by dividing the aggregate  amount so allocated to
the redemption of Wireless Group Common Stock by the average Market Value of one
share of Wireless Group Common Stock during the 10-Trading Day period  beginning
on the 15th Trading Day following the consummation of such Disposition,  and (2)
the number of shares of Wireless  Group  Common Stock  outstanding,  and (ii) in
lieu of issuing solely shares of Common Stock in exchange for shares of Wireless
Group Common Stock,  subject to the  limitations  described in paragraph 2(b) of
this  Part C of this  Article  Third and to the other  provisions  described  in
paragraph  4(c) of this Part C of this  Article  Third,  combine the issuance of
shares of Common  Stock in exchange  for shares of Wireless  Group  Common Stock
with the payment of a dividend on or the  redemption of shares of Wireless Group
Common Stock for cash and/or  other  securities  or other  property as described
below.

         In the event that the Board of Directors elects the option described in
(ii) of the preceding paragraph, the outstanding shares of Wireless Group Common
Stock exchanged for fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock shall be
exchanged at the Exchange Rate and a dividend shall be paid on all the remaining
shares of Wireless  Group  Common Stock  equally on a share for share basis,  or
some or all of the remaining  outstanding  shares of Wireless Group Common Stock
shall be  exchanged  for cash and/or  other  securities  or other  property,  as
follows.  The aggregate amount of such dividend,  in the case of a dividend,  or
the  portion  of the  Wireless  Group  Net  Proceeds  to be  applied  to such an
exchange,  in the case of an  exchange,  shall equal (A) an amount  equal to the
total  Wireless Group Net Proceeds  multiplied by (B) one minus a fraction,  the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock
exchanged for shares of Common Stock and the  denominator  of which shall be the
total number of outstanding  shares of Wireless Group Common Stock. In the event
of an exchange,  if the Significant  Transaction involves the Disposition of all
(not merely  substantially  all) of the  properties  and assets of the  Wireless
Group, then all remaining outstanding shares of Wireless Group Common Stock will
be redeemed  in exchange  for cash  and/or  securities  or other  property in an
aggregate  amount equal to the portion of the Wireless  Group Net Proceeds to be
applied to the exchange. If the Significant Transaction involves the Disposition
of substantially  all (but not all) of the properties and assets of the Wireless
Group,  then the portion of the Wireless Group Net Proceeds to be applied to the
exchange  will be used to redeem a number of shares  equal to the  lesser of (1)
the whole number nearest the number  determined by dividing the aggregate amount
so allocated  to the  redemption  of Wireless  Group Common Stock by the average
Market Value of one share of Wireless  Group Common Stock during the  10-Trading
Day period  beginning  on the 15th  Trading Day  following  consummation  of the
Disposition,  and (2) the  number of  shares  of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock
outstanding.

         For purposes of this  paragraph 4 of this Part C of this Article Third,
in the case of a Significant  Transaction  involving a Disposition of properties
and assets in a series of related  transactions,  such Disposition  shall not be
deemed  to have been  consummated  until  the  consummation  of the last of such
transactions.  Any exchange described in this paragraph 4 of this Part C of this
Article Third shall be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions set
forth in paragraph 5 of this Part C of this Article Third. In the event that, at
the time of any Significant  Transaction,  there are outstanding any Convertible
Securities  convertible  into or exercisable for shares of Wireless Group Common
Stock that would give the  holders  rights to receive  any  dividend or exchange
consideration related to the Significant  Transaction upon exercise,  conversion
or  otherwise,  or would adjust as a result of such dividend or exchange to give
the holder equivalent  economic rights, then the shares of Wireless Group Common
<PAGE>
Stock  underlying  such  Convertible  Securities  will be taken into account for
purposes of determining the terms of any dividend  payment or exchange  effected
in lieu of a Significant Transaction Exchange.

         (d) Payment to Common Stock Group(W).  Concurrently with the payment of
any dividend referred to in paragraph 4(c) of this Part C of this Article Third,
at the election of the Board of Directors,  either (A) the Common Stock Group(W)
shall receive from the Wireless  Group an aggregate  payment of the same kind of
property that is the subject of such  dividend,  which payment shall be equal to
the excess of (i) the quotient  obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate amount of
such  dividend,  as determined  by the Board of  Directors,  by (y) the Wireless
Group Allocation Fraction,  over (ii) the aggregate amount of such dividend,  as
so determined, or (B) the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction will be adjusted as
described in paragraph 9 of this Part C of this Article Third. Any payment to be
made to the Common Stock Group(W) pursuant to the preceding sentence may, at the
discretion  of the Board of  Directors,  be reflected by an  allocation  or by a
direct transfer of cash or other property.

         (e) Exchange  Rate.  For purposes of this paragraph 4 of this Part C of
this Article Third,  the term "Exchange  Rate" shall mean the number of Exchange
Shares for which each share of Wireless Group Common Stock shall be exchangeable
pursuant to a Board  Required  Exchange or a Significant  Transaction  Exchange,
determined  as follows.  If the shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock are to be
exchanged for shares of Common Stock,  each share of Wireless Group Common Stock
shall be exchangeable  for such number of shares of Common Stock  (calculated to
the nearest 1/10,000),  subject to paragraph 5 below, equal to 110% of the ratio
of the Average Market Price Per Share of such Wireless Group Common Stock to the
Average  Market Price Per Share of Common  Stock.  For purposes of computing the
Exchange Rate, the "Average  Market Price Per Share" of Common Stock or Wireless
Group  Common  Stock,  as the case may be, shall mean (i) in the case of a Board
Required  Exchange,  the  average of the daily  Market  Value per share for such
Common Stock or Wireless Group Common Stock for the 40 consecutive  Trading Days
ending on the 15th  Trading Day prior to the date an Exchange  Notice is mailed,
or (ii) in the case of a Significant  Transaction  Exchange,  the average of the
daily  Market  Value per share for such Common  Stock or Wireless  Group  Common
Stock for the 10  consecutive  Trading  Days  beginning  on the 15th Trading Day
following consummation of the Significant Transaction. If the shares of Wireless
Group Common Stock are to be exchanged for shares of one or more Wireless  Group
Subsidiaries,  such shares of Wireless Group Common Stock shall be exchanged, on
a pro  rata  basis,  for an  aggregate  number  of  outstanding  fully  paid and
nonassessable  shares of common  stock of each such  Wireless  Group  Subsidiary
equal to the number of  outstanding  shares of common  stock of such  Subsidiary
held by the  corporation  multiplied by the Wireless Group  Allocation  Fraction
and, if the Board of  Directors  so  determines,  the  remaining  shares of such
Subsidiary  shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to the holders of shares of
Common Stock (or shares of Common Stock shall be  exchanged  for such  remaining
shares of such  Subsidiary);  provided that no such  distribution  (or mandatory
exchange) may occur unless the distribution (or mandatory  exchange) is tax free
to the holders of Common Stock (except with respect to any cash received by such
holders in lieu of  fractional  shares).  If at the time of such an exchange for
shares of one or more Wireless Group  Subsidiaries,  there are  outstanding  any
Convertible  Securities  convertible  into or exercisable for shares of Wireless
Group Common Stock that would become  exercisable or  convertible  for shares of
one or more Wireless Group  Subsidiaries  as a result of such exchange,  and the
obligation  to issue such  shares  under  such  options,  warrants,  convertible
securities or similar rights is not assumed or otherwise  provided for by one or
more Wireless Group Subsidiaries, then the shares of Wireless Group Common Stock
underlying such  Convertible  Securities will be taken into account for purposes
of determining the Exchange Rate for such exchange.
<PAGE>
         For purposes of this  Paragraph 4 of this Part C of this Article Third,
"substantially all of the properties and assets" of the Wireless Group as of any
date shall mean a portion of such properties and assets that represents at least
80% of the Fair Value of the  properties  and assets  attributed to the Wireless
Group as of such date.

5.  Certain Procedures Relating to Exchanges.

         (a) The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion,  elect to issue
fractional  Exchange  Shares in  connection  with an  exchange or to make a cash
payment  in lieu of  fractional  shares,  as  described  below.  If the Board of
Directors  elects  not  to  issue  fractional  Exchange  Shares,  then  no  such
fractional  shares shall be issued in connection  with the exchange of shares of
Wireless  Group Common Stock into Exchange  Shares,  and, in lieu thereof,  each
holder of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock who would  otherwise  be entitled to a
fractional  interest of an Exchange Share shall, upon surrender of such holder's
certificate or certificates  representing shares of Wireless Group Common Stock,
receive a cash payment (without  interest) (the  "Fractional  Payment") equal to
(i) in the case of an exchange for shares of Common Stock, the product resulting
from  multiplying  (A) the  fraction  of a share of Common  Stock to which  such
holder would  otherwise  have been entitled by (B) the Average  Market Price Per
Share of Common Stock on the Exchange  Date,  or (ii) in the case of an exchange
for  shares  of one or  more  Wireless  Group  Subsidiaries,  such  value  as is
determined by the Board of Directors.

         (b) No  adjustments  in  respect  of  dividends  shall be made upon the
exchange of any shares of Wireless Group Common Stock; provided,  however, that,
if the  Exchange  Date with  respect to  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock shall be
subsequent  to  the  record  date  for  the  payment  of  a  dividend  or  other
distribution  thereon  or with  respect  thereto  but  prior to the  payment  or
distribution  thereof,  the  registered  holders of such  shares at the close of
business on such record date shall be entitled to receive the  dividend or other
distribution payable on such shares on the date set for payment of such dividend
or other  distribution,  notwithstanding  the  exchange  of such  shares  or the
corporation's  default in payment of the  dividend or  distribution  due on such
date.

         (c) At such  time or times as the  corporation  exercises  its right to
cause a Board Required Exchange, and at the time of any Significant  Transaction
Exchange,  the corporation  shall give notice of such exchange to the holders of
Wireless  Group  Common Stock whose  shares are to be  exchanged,  by mailing by
first-class mail a notice of such exchange (an "Exchange  Notice"),  in the case
of an exchange at the discretion of the Board of Directors, not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days  prior to the date  fixed  for such  exchange  (the  "Exchange
Date"), and, in the case of any other required exchange,  as soon as practicable
before or after the Exchange  Date, in either case,  to their last  addresses as
they  appear upon the  corporation's  books.  Each such  Exchange  Notice  shall
specify the Exchange Date and the Exchange Rate applicable to such exchange, and
shall state that issuance of  certificates  representing  the applicable type of
Exchange  Shares to be received upon exchange of shares of Wireless Group Common
Stock  shall be upon  surrender  of  certificates  representing  such  shares of
Wireless Group Common Stock.

         (d) Before any holder of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive certificates  representing such Exchange Shares, such holder
must surrender,  at such office as the corporation  shall specify,  certificates
for such shares of Wireless Group Common Stock duly endorsed to the  corporation
or in blank or accompanied by proper  instruments of transfer to the Corporation
or  in  blank,  unless  the  corporation  shall  waive  such  requirement.   The
<PAGE>
corporation  shall, as soon as practicable  after such surrender of certificates
representing such shares of Wireless Group Common Stock,  issue and deliver,  at
the office of the transfer agent representing Exchange Shares, to the holder for
whose account such shares of Wireless Group Common Stock were so surrendered, or
to such holder's  nominee or nominees,  certificates  representing the number of
Exchange  Shares to which  such  holder  shall be  entitled,  together  with the
Fractional Payment, if any.

         (e) From and after any Exchange  Date, all rights of a holder of shares
of Wireless Group Common Stock shall cease except for the right,  upon surrender
of the certificates  representing such shares of Wireless Group Common Stock, to
receive  certificates  representing  Exchange  Shares together with a Fractional
Payment, if any, as described in paragraphs 5(a) and 5(d) of this Part C of this
Article  Third and rights to dividends  as  described in paragraph  5(b) of this
Part C of this Article Third. No holder of a certificate that immediately  prior
to the  applicable  Exchange Date  represented  shares of Wireless  Group Common
Stock  shall be entitled to receive  any  dividend  or other  distribution  with
respect to Exchange  Shares until  surrender of such holder's  certificate for a
certificate or certificates  representing  Exchange Shares. Upon surrender,  the
holder shall receive the amount of any dividends or other distributions (without
interest)  that were  payable  with  respect to a record date after the Exchange
Date,  but that were not paid by reason of the  foregoing  with  respect  to the
number of Exchange Shares represented by the certificate or certificates  issued
upon such  surrender.  From and after an Exchange  Date  applicable  to Wireless
Group  Common  Stock,  the  corporation  shall,  however,  be  entitled to treat
certificates  for Wireless Group Common Stock that have not yet been surrendered
for exchange as evidencing  the  ownership of the number of Exchange  Shares for
which the shares of Wireless Group Common Stock represented by such certificates
have been exchanged, notwithstanding the failure to surrender such certificates.

         (f) If any  certificate  for Exchange  Shares is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the certificate  representing  shares of Wireless Group
Common  Stock  surrendered  in exchange  therefor is  registered,  it shall be a
condition of such  issuance  that the person  requesting  the issuance  pays any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of  certificates  for
such  Exchange  Shares in a name  other  than that of the  record  holder of the
certificate surrendered,  or establishes, to the satisfaction of the corporation
or its  agent,  that  such  tax has  been  paid or is not  applicable.  Under no
circumstances  shall the corporation be liable to a holder of shares of Wireless
Group Common Stock for any Exchange Shares or dividends or distributions thereon
delivered to a public official  pursuant to any applicable  abandoned  property,
escheat or similar law.

         (g) At the time an Exchange  Notice is  delivered  with  respect to any
shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock,  or at the time of the Exchange Date, if
earlier, the corporation shall have reserved and kept available,  solely for the
purpose of issuance upon exchange of the  outstanding  shares of Wireless  Group
Common  Stock,  such  number of Exchange  Shares as shall be  issuable  upon the
exchange of the number of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock  specified or to
be specified in the applicable  Exchange  Notice,  provided that the corporation
shall not under any circumstances be precluded from satisfying its obligation in
respect of the exchange of the outstanding shares of Wireless Group Common Stock
by delivery of  purchased  Exchange  Shares that are held in the treasury of the
corporation.

6.  Liquidation.

         In  the  event  of a  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up of the
corporation,  whether  voluntary or involuntary,  after payment or provision for
payment of the debts and other liabilities of the corporation and subject to the
prior payment in full of the  preferential  amounts to which any class or series
<PAGE>
of Preferred Stock is entitled, (a) as provided in paragraph 6 of Part B of this
Article  Third,  the holders of the shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common
Stock and the holders of the shares of Class B Liberty  Media Group Common Stock
shall share equally, on a share for share basis, in a percentage of the funds of
the corporation  remaining for distribution to its common  shareholders equal to
100%  multiplied by the average daily ratio  (expressed as a decimal) of Y/Z for
the  20-Trading  Day period  ending on the  Trading Day prior to the date of the
public  announcement  of such  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up, (b) the
holders  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  shall  share in the  aggregate  in a
percentage of the funds of the  corporation  remaining for  distribution  to its
common  shareholders  equal  to  100%  multiplied  by the  average  daily  ratio
(expressed as a decimal) of X/Z for such 20-Trading Day period,  (c) the holders
of the shares of Wireless  Group Common Stock shall share in the  aggregate in a
percentage of the funds of the  corporation  remaining for  distribution  to its
common  shareholders  equal  to  100%  multiplied  by the  average  daily  ratio
(expressed  as a decimal)  of W/Z for such  20-Trading  Day  period,  and (d) if
applicable, the holders of the shares of any other class of common shares of the
corporation  (other than Common  Stock,  Wireless  Group Common Stock or Liberty
Media  Group  Common  Stock),  on  the  basis  that  may be set  forth  in  this
Certificate  with respect to any such shares,  shall share in the aggregate in a
percentage of the funds of the  corporation  remaining for  distribution  to its
common  shareholders  equal  to  100%  multiplied  by the  average  daily  ratio
(expressed as a decimal) of V/Z for such  20-Trading Day period,  where Y is the
aggregate Market  Capitalization of the Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock
and the Class B Liberty  Media Group Common  Stock,  X is the  aggregate  Market
Capitalization of the Common Stock, W is the aggregate Market  Capitalization of
the Wireless Group Common Stock, V is the aggregate  Market  Capitalization,  if
applicable,  of any other  class of common  shares  (other  than  Common  Stock,
Liberty Media Group Common Stock and Wireless Group Common Stock),  and Z is the
aggregate  Market  Capitalization  of (i) the Class A Liberty Media Group Common
Stock and the Class B Liberty Media Group Common  Stock,  (ii) the Common Stock,
(iii) the Wireless  Group Common Stock and (iv) any other class of common shares
of the  corporation  (other than Common Stock,  Liberty Media Group Common Stock
and Wireless Group Common  Stock).  Neither the  consolidation  or merger of the
corporation  with or into any other  corporation or  corporations  nor the sale,
transfer or lease of all or  substantially  all of the assets of the corporation
shall  itself be deemed to be a  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up of the
corporation  within  the  meaning  of this  paragraph  6 of this  Part C of this
Article  Third.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  transaction or series of
related  transactions that results in all of the assets and liabilities included
in the Wireless Group being held by one or more Wireless Group Subsidiaries, and
the  distribution  of  some  or  all  of  the  shares  of  such  Wireless  Group
Subsidiaries (and no other material assets or liabilities) to the holders of the
outstanding  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock shall not  constitute a voluntary or
involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up of the  corporation  for
purposes of this paragraph 6 of this Part C of this Article Third,  but shall be
subject to paragraph 4 of this Part C of this Article Third. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any transaction or series of related transactions that results in all
of the assets and liabilities  included in the Liberty Media Group being held by
one or more Liberty Media Group  Subsidiaries  (as defined in paragraph  5(a) of
Part B of this Article Third),  and the distribution of such Liberty Media Group
Subsidiaries (and no other material assets or liabilities) to the holders of the
outstanding Liberty Media Group Common Stock shall not constitute a voluntary or
involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up of the  corporation  for
purposes of this paragraph 6 of this Part C of this Article Third,  but shall be
subject to paragraph 5(a) of Part B of this Article Third.

7.  Determinations by the Board of Directors.

         Any  determinations  made by the Board of Directors under any provision
of  this  Part C of this  Article  Third  shall  be  final  and  binding  on all
shareholders of the corporation, except as may otherwise be required by law. The
<PAGE>
corporation  shall  prepare a  statement  of any  determination  by the Board of
Directors,  respecting  the fair  market  value  of any  properties,  assets  or
securities, and shall file such statement with the Secretary of the corporation.

8.  Adjustment of the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction.

         (a) The denominator of the Wireless Group Allocation  Fraction shall be
adjusted from time to time as deemed  appropriate  by the Board of Directors (i)
to reflect  subdivisions  (by stock split or  otherwise)  and  combinations  (by
reverse  stock split or  otherwise)  of Wireless  Group  Common  Stock and stock
dividends  payable in shares of Wireless Group Common Stock, (ii) to reflect the
fair market value of  contributions or allocations by the corporation of cash or
property or other assets or  liabilities  from the Common Stock  Group(W) to the
Wireless  Group  (or vice  versa),  or of cash or  property  or other  assets or
liabilities of the Common Stock Group(W) to, or for the benefit of, employees of
the Wireless Group in connection with employee  benefit plans or arrangements of
the corporation or any of its subsidiaries (or vice versa), (iii) to reflect the
number of shares of capital stock of the corporation  contributed to, or for the
benefit of,  employees of the Wireless Group in connection with benefit plans or
arrangements  of the  corporation  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  (iv) to reflect
repurchases by the  corporation of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock for the
account of the Wireless Group, (v) to reflect issuances of Wireless Group Common
Stock for the account of the Wireless Group,  (vi) to reflect dividends or other
distributions  to holders of the  Wireless  Group  Common Stock to the extent no
payment  is made to the  Common  Stock  Group(W),  and (vii)  under  such  other
circumstances  as the Board of Directors  determines  appropriate to reflect the
economic  substance of any other event or  circumstance,  provided that, in each
case,  the  adjustment  shall be made in a manner that is fair and  equitable to
holders of Common Stock and Wireless Group Common Stock (and intended to reflect
the relative deemed  economic  ownership  interest,  if any, of the Common Stock
Group(W) in the Wireless  Group).  Any adjustment made by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall,  subject to the foregoing,  be at the
sole discretion of the Board of Directors,  and all such determinations shall be
final and binding on all shareholders of the  corporation.  For purposes of this
paragraph 8 of this Part C of this Article Third, the consideration  paid by the
Common Stock  Group(W) to acquire any assets or other property or contributed or
allocated to the Wireless  Group shall be presumed to be the "fair market value"
as of its acquisition.

         (b) Without duplication of any adjustment pursuant to paragraph 8(a) of
this Part C of this Article Third, in the event that the corporation shall issue
shares of Wireless  Group Common  Stock for the account of the  Wireless  Group,
then  the  denominator  of the  Wireless  Group  Allocation  Fraction  shall  be
increased by the number of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock so issued.

         (c) Without duplication of any adjustment pursuant to paragraph 8(a) of
this Part C of this Article  Third,  if, in connection  with any share  issuance
described in paragraph 8(b) of this Part C of this Article Third,  or otherwise,
the  corporation  contributes or allocates cash or other property or assets from
the Common Stock Group(W) to the Wireless Group, the denominator of the Wireless
Group Allocation Fraction shall be increased (or further increased) by an amount
obtained by dividing (i) the fair market value of such cash,  property or assets
(as  determined by the Board of  Directors)  by (ii) the net per share  offering
price of the Wireless Group Common Stock.

9.  Certain Definitions.

such Trading Day (including, without limitation, because such securities are not
publicly  held),  the  market  value  of a share  of such  class  or  series  as

split or otherwise) of outstanding shares of Common Stock, Wireless Group Common

Person in which such  Person's  ownership  and voting  interest is sufficient to

Stock and, in the event that the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction is less than
one, the holders of Common Stock (or any such securities into which the Wireless

changed  or for which they may have been  exchanged),  as the case may be, to be
tax free to such holders.

         "Subsidiary"  shall mean, with respect to any Person,  any corporation,

date of initial  issuance of the Wireless  Group  Common  Stock,  regardless  of
whether such  amendment,  clarification  or change is issued to or in connection
with a proceeding  involving the  corporation,  the Common Stock Group(W) or the
Wireless  Group and  whether or not  subject  to  appeal,  there is more than an
insubstantial risk that:

                 (i) for tax  purposes,  any  issuance of Wireless  Group Common
          Stock would be treated as a sale or other taxable  disposition  by the
          corporation  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  of  any  of  the  assets,
          operations or relevant subsidiaries to which the Wireless Group Common
          Stock relates,

                 (ii) the  existence  of the  Wireless  Group Common Stock would
          subject the  corporation,  its  Subsidiaries or affiliates,  or any of
          their  respective  successors or shareholders to the imposition of tax
          or to other adverse tax consequences, or

                 (iii) for tax purposes,  either Common Stock or Wireless  Group
          Common Stock is not or, at any time in the future, will not be treated
          solely as common stock of the corporation.

         "Wireless Group" shall mean, as of any date that any shares of Wireless
Group  Common  Stock have been issued and  continue to be  outstanding,  without
duplication,  the direct or indirect interest of the corporation  (either itself
or through direct or indirect subsidiaries,  affiliates, joint ventures or other
investments,  or any of  their  predecessors  or  successors)  (a) in all of the
businesses,  assets and liabilities reflected in the financial statements of the
Wireless  Group dated  September 30, 1999,  publicly  filed by the  corporation,
including any successor to the Wireless Group by merger,  consolidation  or sale
of all or  substantially  all of its assets (whether or not in connection with a
Wireless  Group  Related  Business  Transaction),   (b)  the  other  assets  and
liabilities  (contingent or otherwise) of the corporation  and its  Subsidiaries
primarily related to the businesses,  assets and liabilities described in clause

date, (c) all assets,  liabilities and businesses acquired by the Wireless Group
or acquired by the corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for the account of, or

Group  of  any  new  shares  of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock  or  Convertible
Securities),  in each case,  after the date of such financial  statements and as
determined  by the Board of  Directors  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of
paragraph 8 of this Part C of this  Article  Third,  and (d) the proceeds of any
Disposition of any of the foregoing;  provided, however, that the Wireless Group
shall not include (a) any assets,  liabilities  or businesses  disposed of after
the  date  of  such  financial  statements  or (b) any  assets,  liabilities  or
businesses  allocated to the Common Stock  Group(W) or otherwise  distributed or
otherwise  transferred  from the  Wireless  Group,  whether to the Common  Stock
Group(W),  to holders of shares of Wireless Group Common Stock or otherwise,  in
each case after the date of such  financial  statements and as determined by the
Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of this Part
C of this  Article  Third.  The Wireless  Group shall not include any  business,
assets or liabilities of the Liberty Media Group.
<PAGE>
         "Wireless  Group  Allocated  Portion"  shall mean,  with respect to the
Wireless Group as a whole, or any dividend, distribution, payment, consideration
or other amount or  allocation  requiring  apportionment  between the holders of

on the one  hand,  and  the  Common  Stock  Group(W),  on the  other  hand,  the
following:  (a) in the case of the Wireless Group as a whole,  the proportion of
such Group represented by the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction, and (b) in the
case of any other  amount  or  allocation,  the  product  of (i) such  amount or
allocation and (ii) the Wireless Group Allocation Fraction.

         "Wireless  Group  Allocation  Fraction"  shall mean,  as of any date of
determination,  a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares
of Wireless Group Common Stock  outstanding on such date and the  denominator of
which shall be a number initially  determined by the Board of Directors,  in its
sole discretion,  prior to the Initial Issuance Date, subject to adjustment from
time to time as described  in paragraph 9 of this Part C of this Article  Third,
provided  that such  fraction  shall in no event be  greater  than  one.  If the
holders  of any  securities  of the  corporation  or any other  Person  that are
convertible  into or  exercisable or  exchangeable  for shares of Wireless Group
Common Stock are entitled to participate  in any dividend or other  distribution
with respect to the Wireless  Group Common  Stock,  such shares so issuable upon
such conversion, exercise or exchange shall be taken into account in calculating
the Wireless  Group  Allocation  Fraction  and any amount  payable to the Common
Stock  Group(W)  in such  manner  as the  Board of  Directors  determines  to be
appropriate.

         "Wireless Group Available  Dividend Amount" shall mean, as of any date,
the Wireless  Group  Allocated  Portion of the excess of (a) the amount by which
the total  assets of the  Wireless  Group  exceed the total  liabilities  of the
Wireless  Group as of such  date  over  (b) the sum of (i) the par  value of all
issued  shares  of  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock  and each  class or series of
Preferred  Stock  attributed  to the  Wireless  Group,  (ii) the  amount  of the
consideration  received  for any shares of  Preferred  Stock  attributed  to the
Wireless Group without par value that have been issued,  except such part of the
consideration  therefor  as may  have  been  allocated  to  surplus  in a manner
permitted by law, and (iii) any amount not included in  subclauses  (i) and (ii)
above that the corporation (by appropriate action of the Board of Directors) has
transferred to stated capital  specifically  in respect of Wireless Group Common
Stock,  minus (c) all  reductions  from such sums set forth in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) above as have been  effected in a manner  permitted by law;  provided,
however,  that, in the event that the law governing the corporation changes from
that governing the corporation on the date the adoption of the Amendment to this
Certificate  pursuant to which the Wireless  Group  Common Stock was  authorized
(whether  because of amendment of the  applicable  law or because of a change in
the  jurisdiction  of  incorporation  of  the  corporation   through  merger  or
otherwise),  the Wireless Group Available  Dividend Amount shall mean the amount
of dividends,  as determined by the Board of Directors,  that could be paid by a
corporation   (governed  under  such  applicable  law)  having  the  assets  and
liabilities of the Wireless  Group,  an amount of outstanding  common stock (and
having an aggregate par value) equal to the amount (and  aggregate par value) of
the  outstanding  Wireless  Group  Common  Stock and of each  class or series of
Preferred  Stock  attributed  to the  Wireless  Group  and  having  an amount of
earnings or loss or other relevant corporate attributes as reasonably determined
by the Board of Directors in light of all factors  deemed  relevant by the Board
of Directors.

                  Secretary  of  the  company  and  such  other   business  must

                  following the calendar day on which public announcement of the
                  date of such meeting is first made by the company. In no event
                  shall the public  announcement  of an adjournment of an annual
                  meeting  commence  a new  time  period  for  the  giving  of a
                  shareholder's  notice as described above.  Such  shareholder's
                  notice  shall  set  forth  (a)  as to  each  person  whom  the
                  shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as
                  a director  all  information  relating  to such person that is
                  required  to be  disclosed  in  solicitations  of proxies  for
                  election of directors in an election contest,  or is otherwise
                  required,  in each case pursuant to  Regulation  14A under the
                  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended  (the  "Exchange
                  Act") and Rule  14a-11  thereunder  (including  such  person's
                  written  consent to being  named in the proxy  statement  as a
                  nominee  and to serving as a director if  elected);  (b) as to
                  any  description of any other  business  desired to be brought
                  before the  meeting,  the  reasons for  conducting  such other
                  business  at the  meeting  and any  material  interest in such
                  other business of such  shareholder  and beneficial  owner, if
                  any, on whose behalf the  proposal is made;  and (c) as to the
                  shareholder  giving the notice and the  beneficial  owner,  if
                  any, on whose  behalf the  nomination  or proposal is made (i)
                  the name and  address of such  shareholder,  as they appear on
                  the company's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the
                  class and  number of  shares  of the  company  which are owned
                  beneficially  and of  record  by  such  shareholder  and  such
                  beneficial owner.

                           (3)  Notwithstanding  anything in the second sentence
                  of  paragraph  (A)(2) of this By-Law to the  contrary,  in the
                  event that the number of  directors to be elected to the Board
                  of  Directors  of the  company  is  increased  and there is no
                  public  announcement by the company naming all of the nominees
                  for director or specifying the size of the increased  Board of
                  Directors at least 100 days prior to the first  anniversary of
                  the preceding  year's annual meeting,  a shareholder's  notice
                  required by this By-Law shall also be considered  timely,  but
                  only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by
                  such  increase,  if it shall be delivered to the  Secretary at
                  the principal  executive offices of the company not later than
                  the close of  business  on the 10th day  following  the day on
                  which such public announcement is first made by the company.
<PAGE>
                  (B) Special Meetings of  Stockholders.  Nominations of persons
         for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting
         of shareholders  at which  directors are to be elected  pursuant to the
         company's  notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of
         Directors or (b) provided  that the Board of Directors  has  determined
         that directors shall be elected at such meeting,  by any shareholder of
         the  company  who is a  shareholder  of record at the time of giving of
         notice  provided for in this  By-Law,  who shall be entitled to vote at
         the meeting and who complies  with the notice  procedures  set forth in
         this  By-Law.  In the event the  company  calls a  special  meeting  of
         shareholders  for the purpose of electing one or more  directors to the
         Board of  Directors,  any such  shareholder  may  nominate  a person or
         persons  (as the case may be),  for  election  to such  position(s)  as
         specified  in the  company's  notice of meeting,  if the  shareholder's
         notice  required by paragraph  (A)(2) of this By-Law shall be delivered
         to the Secretary at the principal  executive offices of the company not
         earlier  than the  close of  business  on the  120th  day prior to such
         special  meeting  and not later than the close of business on the later
         of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following
         the day on which public  announcement  is first made of the date of the
         special meeting and of the nominees  proposed by the Board of Directors
         to  be  elected  at  such  meeting.   In  no  event  shall  the  public
         announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time
         period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.

                  (C)  General.  (1) Only  such  persons  who are  nominated  in
         accordance  with  the  procedures  set  forth in this  By-Law  shall be
         eligible  to  serve  as  directors  and  only  such  business  shall be
         conducted  at a meeting  of  shareholders  as shall  have been  brought
         before the meeting in accordance  with the procedures set forth in this
         By-Law.  Except as  otherwise  provided  by law,  the  Chairman  of the
         meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination
         or any business  proposed to be brought  before the meeting was made or
         proposed,  as the case may be, in accordance  with the  procedures  set
         forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not
         in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective proposal
         or nomination shall be disregarded.

         (2) For  purposes  of this  By-Law,  "public  announcement"  shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated
Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
company with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  pursuant to Section 13, 14
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

         (3)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing   provisions  of  this  By-Law,  a
shareholder  shall also comply with all applicable  requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and  regulations  thereunder  with  respect to the matters set
forth in this  By-Law.  Nothing  in this  By-Law  shall be deemed to affect  any
rights (i) of  shareholders  to request  inclusion of proposals in the company's
proxy  statement  pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the  Exchange  Act or (ii) of the
holders of any series of  Preferred  Stock to elect  directors  under  specified
circumstances.

         Section 6. The  Chairman  of the Board of  Directors  may  postpone  or
adjourn  any  meeting of the  shareholders  from time to time,  whether or not a
quorum is present. The chair of the meeting shall determine all matters relating
to the  efficient  conduct  of the  meeting,  including  but not  limited to the
maintenance of order and decorum.

                      THE CONDUCT OF SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS

         At all meetings of the shareholders, the holders of forty per centum of
the  shares  entitled  to vote  thereat  shall  constitute  a quorum,  except as
otherwise required by law; but the shareholders  present may adjourn the meeting
to another  time or place  despite  the absence of a quorum.  Every  shareholder
entitled to vote shall be  entitled  to one vote for each share  standing in his
name on the record of shareholders;  and every shareholder  entitled to vote may
vote in person or by proxy.

         At all meetings of shareholders,  a shareholder,  or such person's duly

                          Eligibility and Participation

         individual may become a Participant by:

         (a)      Completing,  executing,  and returning  all of the  enrollment

                  by the Administrator from time to time.

         Subject  to the  provisions  of  Sections  2.1,  2.2,  3.3 and 4.1,  an
         Eligible  Executive shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
         Program until the occurrence of any event described in Section 6.0 that
         causes the termination of his or her participation in the Program.

2.1      Disability  Prior to Normal  Termination  Date. In the event that (a) a
         Participant  becomes  disabled (as determined  under the AT&T Long Term
         Disability  Plan for  Management  Employees),  and (b) the  Participant
         continues  to be  disabled  until his or her  Normal  Termination  Date
         (without  regard  to  whether  the  Participant  continues  to  receive
         payments  under  the AT&T  Long  Term  Disability  Plan for  Management
         Employees  through  such date),  the  Participant  shall be eligible to
         continue  to  participate  in the  Program  until  his  or  her  Normal
         Termination  Date.  If, for any reason,  the  Participant  ceases to be
         disabled  (as  determined  under  the  terms  of  the  AT&T  Long  Term
         Disability Plan for Management  Employees) prior to reaching his or her

         Program may cease prior to his or her Normal  Termination Date upon the
         occurrence of another  event  described in Section 6.0. For purposes of
         this  Program,   a  Participant   shall  be  considered   eligible  for
         retirement-related  benefits if he or she has satisfied the eligibility
         conditions  for receipt of  postretirement  medical  benefits under the
         AT&T Medical Expense Plan for Retired Employees, as then in effect.

2.3      Recommencement of Participation.  Once a Participant's participation in
         the Program has  terminated  as provided in Section 6.0 (other than due
         to the  occurrence  of an event  described in Sections  6.0(a),  (b) or
         (c)), he or she may  recommence  participation  in the Program if he or
         she  (a) is an  Eligible  Executive  at the  time  participation  is to
         recommence;   and  (b)   satisfies   any  and  all   requirements   for
         recommencement of participation established by the Administrator in his
         or her sole discretion.

                         Procurement of Insurance Policy

3.0      Insurance  Application  Requirements.  The  Company  shall apply to the

         in an amount  determined by the Company to be sufficient to provide the
         applicable Benefit Amount for the Eligible Executive.

3.1      Cooperation  Requirement for Eligible Executive.  An Eligible Executive
         shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in its efforts to apply for
         and obtain the Insurance Policy on his or her life by:

         (a)      Furnishing  such  information  as the  Insurer may require for
                  completion of the insurance  application and related forms and
                  documents;

         (b)      Taking  such  physical   examinations  and  supplying  medical
                  history as may be requested by the Insurer;

         (c)      Signing  the  application  for  the  Insurance  Policy  as the
                  insured; and

         (d)      Doing any other act to comply with the underwriting and policy
                  issuance requirements which may reasonably be requested by the
                  Insurer or the Administrator.

3.2      Cooperation   Requirement  for  Policyholder.   A  Policyholder   shall
         reasonably  cooperate  with the Company in its efforts to apply for and
         obtain the Insurance Policy on the life of an Eligible Executive by:

         (a)      Furnishing  such  information  as the  Insurer may require for
                  completion of the insurance  application and related forms and
                  documents;

         (b)      Signing  the  application  for  the  Insurance  Policy  as the
                  proposed policy owner; and

         (c)      Doing any other act to comply with the underwriting and policy
                  issuance requirements which may reasonably be requested by the
                  Insurer or the Administrator.

3.3      Consequences  of  Failure  to  Cooperate.  The  Company  shall  have no
         obligation  to  the  Eligible   Executive,   the  Policyholder  or  the
         Policyholder's   Beneficiary   under  the  Program  and  the   Eligible
         Executive's participation in the Program shall become null, void and of
         no force or effect if:

         (a)      The Administrator,  in his or her sole discretion,  determines
                  that  an  Eligible  Executive  or  the  Policyholder  has  not
                  adequately   cooperated   in  the  process  of  procuring  the
                  Insurance Policy on the Eligible  Executive's life as required
                  by Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively; or

         (b)      The Company is, for any reason,  unable to obtain insurance in
                  the  specified  amount  on an  Eligible  Executive's  life  at
                  standard rates or rates otherwise acceptable to the Company.

                             Incidents of Ownership

4.0      Policy  Ownership.  The Insurance  Policy shall, at all times, be owned
         solely and  absolutely by the  Policyholder,  except in the event of an
         assignment  to an Assignee as provided  for in Section 4.2. The person,
         trust,  entity  or  organization  that  will be the  Policyholder  with
         respect to a Participant shall be determined as follows:

         (a)      Eligible  Executive Who  Participated  in Prior  Programs with
                  Single Policy Owner.  If on September 30, 1999 (i) an Eligible
                  Executive  was  covered as an  insured  under one or more life
                  insurance policies that are subject to a collateral assignment
                  with the Company under one or both of the Prior Programs,  and
                  (ii) all such life  insurance  policies were owned by a single
                  policy owner (or  assignee),  such policy owner (or  assignee)
                  shall  be the  Eligible  Executive's  Policyholder  under  the
                  Program.

         (b)      Eligible  Executive Who  Participated  in Prior  Programs with
                  Multiple  Policy  Owners.  If on  September  30,  1999  (i) an
                  Eligible Executive was covered as an insured under one or more
                  life  insurance  policies  that are  subject  to a  collateral
                  assignment agreement with the Company under one or both of the
                  Prior Programs, and (ii) all such life insurance policies were
                  owned by two or more different  policy owners (or  assignees),
                  the Eligible Executive's  Policyholder under the Program shall
                  be the person,  trust, entity or organization that all of such
                  policy owners or assignees  (excluding the Eligible  Executive
                  if he or  she is one of the  policy  owners)  agree  upon  and
                  designate  as the  Policyholder  with  respect to the Eligible
                  Executive.  If, for any reason, an agreement among such policy
                  owners  (or  assignees)  cannot be reached by October 1, 1999,
                  and/or no  designation  of  Policyholder  is  received  by the
                  Administrator by October 1, 1999, the Eligible Executive shall
                  be the Policyholder  unless the  Administrator,  in his or her
                  sole  discretion,  determines  that one or more other persons,
                  trusts,  entities or organizations  should be the Policyholder
                  with  respect  to  the   Insurance   Policy  on  the  Eligible
                  Executive's life.

         (c)      Eligible  Executive  Who  Did  Not  Participate  in the  Prior
                  Programs.  If on September 30, 1999, an Eligible Executive was
                  not  covered  as an insured  under one or more life  insurance
                  policies issued under one or both of the Prior  Programs,  the
                  Eligible  Executive's  Policyholder under the Program shall be
                  the person (including the Eligible  Executive),  trust, entity
                  or organization that the Eligible  Executive  designates to be
                  his or her  Policyholder in the Eligible  Executive's  written
                  enrollment  application for participation in the Program.  If,
                  for any reason, an Eligible  Executive who did not participate
                  in either of the Prior Programs on September 30, 1999 fails to
                  designate  a  Policyholder  under the  Program,  the  Eligible
                  Executive  shall  be  the  Policyholder  with  respect  to the
                  Insurance Policy on his or her life.
<PAGE>
4.1      Rights of Policyholder  and Company.  Prior to a  Participant's  Normal
         Termination Date, the Policyholder or his or her Assignee shall control
         all  incidents  of  ownership  with  respect  to the  Insurance  Policy
         including all policy cash values and death benefits under the Insurance
         Policy  on  the  Participant's   life.   However,   in  the  event  the
         Policyholder  or his or her Assignee  surrenders the Insurance  Policy,
         withdraws  any cash value from the  Insurance  Policy or obtains a loan
         from the  Insurance  Policy,  the  Participant's  participation  in the
         Program shall  immediately  cease and the Company will not be obligated
         to continue to make any further premium payments as provided by Section
         5.1 for the Insurance Policy.

4.2      Assignment of Insurance  Policy by Policyholder.  A Policyholder  shall
         have the right, at any time, to absolutely and  irrevocably  assign his
         or her rights,  title,  interest,  and incidents of ownership in and to
         the Insurance Policy and any other assignable  rights to benefits under
         this  Program  to  any  person,  trust,  entity  or  organization.  Any
         assignment  shall be subject to the  consent of the  Insurer.  Any such
         assignment shall be on a form approved by the Insurer. No assignment by
         a Policyholder  shall be effective until acknowledged in writing by the
         Insurer. A copy of the written  acknowledgment shall be returned to the
         Policyholder  and the  Assignee.  Once the  assignment of the Insurance
         Policy has been  acknowledged by the Insurer,  the  Policyholder  shall
         have no further rights, title, interest or incidents of ownership, both
         present and future,  in or under the  Insurance  Policy or to any other
         rights to benefits under the Program covered by the assignment, and the
         Assignee  shall have all such assigned  rights,  title,  interest,  and
         incidents of  ownership,  both present and future,  under the Insurance
         Policy and the Program.

4.3      Beneficiary  Elections and Settlement Options. A Policyholder or his or
         her Assignee, if any, may exercise (a) the right to designate or change
         the Beneficiary of life insurance  proceeds under the Insurance  Policy
         pursuant to Section 5.4;  and (b) the right to elect any optional  mode
         of  settlement  with  respect  to such life  insurance  proceeds.  Upon
         request  of a  Policyholder  or  his  or  her  Assignee,  if  any,  the
         applicable  form for any  designation  or change of  Beneficiary or any
         election  of  an  optional  mode  of  settlement  shall  be  sent  to a
         Policyholder, an Assignee or a Beneficiary, as appropriate.

4.4      No Ownership Interest by the Company. No provision in the Program shall
         be construed or  interpreted  to permit or provide the Company with any
         rights,  title,  interest or  incidents of  ownership,  both present or
         future, to the Insurance Policy.

                               Payment of Benefits

5.0      Source of Benefits. The sole benefit under the Program to a Participant
         shall  be the  premium  payments  made by the  Company  to the  Insurer
         pursuant to Section 5.1 to maintain the Insurance  Policy on his or her
         life  and  the  tax   adjustment   made  pursuant  to  Section  5.3.  A
         Beneficiary's  sole source of benefits  under the Program  shall be the
         Insurance Policy under which the Policyholder,  or his or her Assignee,
         designates  a  Beneficiary  to  receive   benefits   payable  upon  the
         Participant's death.

5.1      Payment of Insurance Premiums.  When the Company submits an application
         for the Insurance  Policy on the life of an Eligible  Executive,  or as
         soon  thereafter  as is required by the Insurer,  the Company shall pay
         the initial premium on the Insurance Policy to the Insurer. Thereafter,
         the  Company  shall  annually  (or more  frequently  as required by the
         Insurer)  pay the  premiums  determined  to be due under the  Insurance
         Policy.  While the Eligible  Executive is a Participant,  the amount of
         the premiums paid by the Company shall be sufficient,  as determined by
         the Company in its sole discretion, to maintain life insurance coverage
         on the  life  of the  Participant  equal  to the  Benefit  Amount.  The
         Company's  obligation to make premium  payments on the Insurance Policy
         covering the life of a Participant  shall cease upon the termination of
         the Participant's participation, as provided for in Section 6.0.

5.2      Benefit Amount.

        (a)       The  Benefit  Amount  under  the  Program  with  respect  to a
                  Participant  who is  actively  employed  by an Employer at any
                  time on or  after  October  1,  1999  shall be  determined  as
                  follows:

                  (i)      Prior to Age 65: The Benefit Amount for a Participant
                           prior to age 65 shall be equal to 250  percent of the
                           Participant's annual base salary (determined based on
                           the  Employer's  records) paid to the  Participant by
                           the  Employer,  rounded  up to the next  $1,000.  Any
                           salary  increase  will be  reflected  in the  Benefit
                           Amount as soon as administratively  practicable after
                           the salary increase becomes effective.

                  (ii)     Age  65  and  Older:   The   Benefit   Amount  for  a
                           Participant  age 65 or  older  will be  equal  to the
                           Participant's Benefit Amount at age 64.

         (b)      Any Participant who is eligible for continued participation in
                  the Program  pursuant to the  provisions of either Section 2.1
                  or  Section  2.2 due to  retirement  or  disability  prior  to
                  attainment of his of her Normal  Termination  Date will have a
                  Benefit Amount as described  under Section  5.2(a)(i) and (ii)
                  above,  whichever is applicable,  throughout the Participant's
                  period of continued  participation  in the Program  (under the
                  terms of Section 2.1 or Section 2.2, as applicable); provided,
                  however,  that for purposes of determining such  Participant's
                  Benefit  Amount,   the  Participant's   "annual  base  salary"
                  referred to in Section  5.2(a)(i)  shall be the  Participant's
                  final  "annual  base  salary"  on  the  date  of  his  or  her
                  retirement or disability.

5.3      Tax Adjustment. The Company shall make a tax adjustment with respect to
         each premium payment made to the Insurer pursuant to Section 5.1 on the
         Insurance  Policy  covering the life of a  Participant.  The amount and
         frequency of each tax  adjustment,  as determined by the Company in its
         sole  discretion,  is intended to be  sufficient to cover the estimated
         amount of federal  income taxes and FICA taxes that will be incurred by
         the  Participant  on the  sum of  the  premium  payment  plus  the  tax
         adjustment itself. Each tax adjustment shall be equal to the sum of two
         amounts that are described below and referred to herein respectively as
         the "tax withholding portion" and the "excess portion":

         (a)      Tax Withholding Portion of Tax Adjustment: The tax withholding
                  portion of each tax adjustment  shall be equal to the combined
                  total amount of federal  income taxes and FICA taxes  required
                  to be withheld  with respect to (i) each premium  payment made
                  by the Company; and (ii) each corresponding tax adjustment.

         (b)      Excess Portion of Tax  Adjustment:  The excess portion of each
                  tax   adjustment   shall  be  equal  to  the   applicable  tax
                  adjustment,  reduced by the related tax withholding portion of
                  such tax  adjustment  determined  under  Section  5.3(a)  with
                  respect to the premium payment and the related tax adjustment.

         The  tax  withholding  portion  of  each  tax  adjustment  payment,  as
         described  in  Section  5.3(a)  (above),  shall be paid by the  Company
         directly to the applicable federal tax authorities.  The excess portion
         of each tax adjustment payment, as described in Section 5.3(b) (above),
         shall be paid in cash to the  Participant  (or if he or she is not then
         living,  to his or her estate).  The  Company's  obligation to make tax
         adjustment  payments with respect to a Participant shall cease upon the
         termination of the Participant's  participation in the Program pursuant
         to the provisions of Section 6.0.

5.4      Beneficiary  Designations.  A Policyholder  or, if the Policyholder has
         assigned the Insurance Policy pursuant to Section 4.2, the Assignee may
         designate a Beneficiary  to receive life  insurance  proceeds under the
         Insurance  Policy upon the death of the  Participant,  or may change an
         existing  designation  of the  Beneficiary  to receive  such  insurance
         proceeds.  Any  designation  of Beneficiary or change in the designated
         Beneficiary  shall be  accomplished  in accordance  with the applicable
         terms of the Insurance Policy using forms approved by the Insurer.  If,
         for any reason,  no valid  Beneficiary  designation is on file with the
         Insurer  at the time of the  Participant's  death,  the life  insurance
         proceeds payable under the Insurance Policy shall be paid in accordance
         with the terms of the Insurance Policy.

5.5      No Company or  Employer  Obligation.  Neither the Company nor any other
         Employer  shall  have any  obligation  of any  nature  whatsoever  to a
         Policyholder  or his or her Assignee or Beneficiary  under this Program
         if  the  circumstances  of  the  Participant's  death,  the  terms  and
         conditions of this Program,  or any other reason,  precludes payment of
         life  insurance  proceeds  or any other  benefits  under the  Insurance
         Policy or Program.

5.6      No Affect on Other Company Benefits:  No portion of any premium payment
         on any Insurance Policy or any tax adjustment payment made with respect
         to a  Participant  as provided  in this  Section 5 shall be included or
         otherwise taken into  consideration as pay,  compensation or income for
         purposes  of any other  "employee  welfare  benefit  plan"  (within the
         meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA),  any "employee pension benefit plan"
         (within  the  meaning  of  Section   3(2)  of  ERISA),   or  any  other
         compensation  or benefit plan,  program or  arrangement of any Employer
         covering the Participant  unless  expressly  provided for in such plan,
         program or arrangement.

                  Date;

         (g)      The Policyholder or his or her Assignee,  if any, takes any of

                  senior manager-level position (or equivalent salary grade), as
                  determined by the Administrator; or

         (i)      The   Participant   is  determined   by  the  Executive   Vice

                  violates the provisions of the AT&T Non-Competition Guideline,
                  as  amended  from time to time,  or any other  non-competition
                  commitment of the Participant to any Employer.

         Termination of a  Participant's  participation  in the Program upon the
         occurrence  of any of the events  described  in this  Section 6.0 shall

                  (e.g., loans and withdrawals) shall no longer apply.

6.2      Attainment of Normal  Termination  Date. If a Participant  continues to

         termination of participation:

                  coverage   throughout   the   Participant's   remaining   life
                  expectancy.

         (c)      The  restrictions  in  Section  4.1  on  the  Policyholder  or

                  (e.g., loans and withdrawals) shall no longer apply.

6.3      Discontinuance of Participation  Prior to Normal Termination Date. If a
         Participant's  participation  in  the  Program  terminates  due  to the
         occurrence  of any of the events  described in Section  6.0(c)  through

                  value so as to provide cash values  sufficient to continue any
                  level of coverage  under the Insurance  Policy  throughout the

                               Claims and Appeals

7.0      Claims.  A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit
         to which he or she is entitled under this Program (hereinafter referred
         to as a  "Claimant")  may file a written  request for such benefit with
         the Company's Executive Human Resources  Department,  setting forth his
         or her claim. The request must be addressed to the Company's  Executive
         Human  Resources  Department at its then  principal  place of business.
         Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any Beneficiary's claim for payment of
         life  insurance  proceeds from an Insurance  Policy on a  Participant's
         life shall not be  considered a claim for benefits  under this Program.
         Any such  claim for life  insurance  proceeds  should be filed with the
         Insurer in accordance  with the terms and  provisions of the applicable
         Insurance Policy.

7.1      Claim Decision.  Upon receipt of a claim, the Company's Executive Human
         Resources  Department  shall advise the  Claimant  that a reply will be
         forthcoming  within ninety (90) days and shall,  in fact,  deliver such
         reply within such  period.  The  Company's  Executive  Human  Resources
         Department  may,  however,  extend  the  reply  period  for  up  to  an
         additional ninety (90) days for reasonable cause.

         If the claim is  denied  by the  Company's  Executive  Human  Resources
         Department,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  Company's  Executive  Human
         Resources  Department  shall provide a written  response using language
         calculated to be understood by the Claimant and setting forth:  (a) the
         specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b) specific  references to
         pertinent provisions of this Program on which such denial is based; (c)
         a description of any additional  material or information  necessary for
         the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such
         material or such information is necessary;  (d) appropriate information
         as to the steps to be taken if the Claimant  wishes to submit the claim
         for  review;  and (e) the time  limits for  requesting  a review  under
         Section 7.2 and for review under Section 7.3.

7.2      Request  for  Review.  Within  sixty (60) days after the receipt by the
         Claimant of the written  opinion  described  above,  the  Claimant  may
         request in writing that the  Administrator  review the determination of
         the Company's Executive Human Resources  Department.  Such request must
         be addressed to the  Administrator  at the address for giving notice to
         the Administrator designated in Section 9.3. The Claimant or his or her
         duly authorized  representative may, but need not, review the pertinent
         documents and submit  issues and comments in writing for  consideration
         by the Administrator.  If the Claimant does not request a review of the
         Company's Executive Human Resources  Department's  determination by the
         Administrator  within such sixty (60) day period, the Claimant shall be
         barred and estopped from challenging the determination of the Company's
         Executive Human Resources Department.

7.3      Review of Decision.  Within  sixty (60) days after the  Administrator's
         receipt of a request  for  review,  the  Administrator  will review the
         determination  of the Company's  Executive Human Resources  Department.
         After  considering  all  materials  presented  by  the  Claimant,   the
         Administrator  will  render  a  written  opinion,  written  in a manner
         designed to be understood  by the Claimant,  setting forth the specific
         reasons for the  decision and  containing  specific  references  to the
         pertinent provisions of this Program on which the decision is based. If
         special  circumstances  require  that the sixty (60) day time period be
         extended, the Administrator will so notify the Claimant and will render
         the decision as soon as possible,  but no later than one hundred twenty
         (120) days after receipt of the request for review.
<PAGE>
         The  Administrator  shall serve as the final review committee under the
         Program and shall have sole and  complete  discretionary  authority  to
         determine  conclusively  for all parties,  and in  accordance  with the
         terms of the documents or  instruments  governing the Program,  any and
         all  questions   arising  from   administration   of  the  Program  and
         interpretation  of  all  Program   provisions,   determination  of  all
         questions   relating  to  participation  of  Eligible   Executives  and
         eligibility  for benefits,  determination  of all relevant  facts,  the
         amount and type of  benefits  payable to any  Participant,  Assignee or
         Beneficiary,  and  the  construction  of  all  terms  of  the  Program.
         Decisions by the  Administrator  shall be conclusive and binding on all
         parties and not subject to further review.

         In any case, a  Participant  may have further  rights under ERISA.  The
         Program  provisions  require  that  Participants  pursue  all claim and
         appeal rights described above before they seek any other legal recourse
         regarding claims for benefits.

                            Amendment and Termination

8.0      Continuation   of  Program.   The  Company  does  not   guarantee   the
         continuation of the Program or any benefits during  employment or at or
         during retirement, nor does the Company guarantee any specific level of
         benefits.  Benefits  are  provided  under the Program at the  Company's
         discretion  and do not create a contract  of  employment.  Neither  the
         establishment  nor the  continuance  of the Plan shall be  construed as
         conferring  any legal rights upon any  Eligible  Executive or any other
         person for continuation of employment,  nor shall such establishment or
         continuance  interfere  with the right of the Company to discharge  any
         Eligible Executive without regard to the existence of the Program.  The
         Company  intends to continue  the Program  indefinitely;  however,  the
         Board  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Program at any time
         pursuant to Section 8.1.

8.1      Amendment or Termination. The Board or pursuant to delegated authority,
         the  Chairman  of the  Board  (or in his  absence  the  Executive  Vice
         President - Human Resources)  ("Delegate"),  may amend, modify, suspend
         or  change  the  Program  from  time to  time,  and the  Board  (or its
         Delegate) may terminate the Program at any time. Program amendments may
         include,  but are not limited to, elimination or reduction in the level
         or type of benefits provided to any class or classes of employees.

                          Eligibility and Participation

2.0      Eligibility   Conditions.   Upon  becoming  an  Eligible  Director,  an
         individual may become a Participant by:

         (a)      Completing,  executing,  and returning  all of the  enrollment

         Eligible  Director  shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
         Program until the occurrence of any event described in Section 6.0 that
         causes the termination of his or her participation in the Program.

         Participant becomes disabled,  and (b) the Participant  continues to be
         disabled  until his or her Normal  Termination  Date,  the  Participant
         shall be eligible to continue to  participate  in the Program until his
         or her Normal  Termination  Date. If, for any reason,  the  Participant
         ceases to be disabled  prior to reaching his or her Normal  Termination
         Date  and  the  Participant   does  not  resume  active  service  as  a
         non-employee  member of the Board, the  Participant's  participation in
         the  Program  shall  terminate  as of the  date  of  cessation  of such
         disability status.

2.2      Retirement  Prior to  Normal  Termination  Date.  In the  event  that a
         Participant  retires from service as a non-employee member of the Board
         prior to his or her Normal  Termination  Date, the Participant shall be
         eligible  to continue to  participate  in the Program  until his or her
         Normal   Termination   Date.   Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,   the
         Participant's  participation  in the  Program may cease prior to his or
         her  Normal  Termination  Date upon the  occurrence  of  another  event
         described in Section 6.0. For purposes of this  Program,  a Participant
         will be deemed to retire as a  non-employee  member of the Board on the
         effective date of his or her resignation from the Board or the last day
         of a Participant's term as a non-employee  member of the Board if he or
         she is not re-elected for a subsequent term on the Board.

2.3      Recommencement of Participation.  Once a Participant's participation in
         the Program has  terminated  as provided in Section 6.0 (other than due
         to the  occurrence  of an event  described in Sections  6.0(a),  (b) or
         (c)), he or she may  recommence  participation  in the Program if he or
         she is an Eligible Director at the time participation is to recommence.

         applicable Benefit Amount for the Eligible Director.

3.1      Cooperation  Requirement for Eligible  Director.  An Eligible  Director
         shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in its efforts to apply for
         and obtain the Insurance Policy on his or her life by:

         (a)      Furnishing  such  information  as the  Insurer may require for
                  completion of the insurance  application and related forms and
                  documents;

         (b)      Taking  such  physical   examinations  and  supplying  medical
                  history as may be requested by the Insurer;

         (c)      Signing  the  application  for  the  Insurance  Policy  as the

         (d)      Doing any other act to comply with the underwriting and policy
                  issuance requirements which may reasonably be requested by the
                  Insurer or the Administrator.

3.2      Cooperation   Requirement  for  Policyholder.   A  Policyholder   shall
         reasonably  cooperate  with the Company in its efforts to apply for and
         obtain the Insurance Policy on the life of an Eligible Director by:

         (a)      Furnishing  such  information  as the  Insurer may require for
                  completion of the insurance  application and related forms and
                  documents;

         (b)      Signing  the  application  for  the  Insurance  Policy  as the
                  proposed policy owner; and

         (c)      Doing any other act to comply with the underwriting and policy
                  issuance requirements which may reasonably be requested by the
                  Insurer or the Administrator.

3.3      Consequences  of  Failure  to  Cooperate.  The  Company  shall  have no
         obligation  to  the  Eligible   Director,   the   Policyholder  or  the
         Policyholder's   Beneficiary   under  the  Program  and  the   Eligible
         Director's  participation in the Program shall become null, void and of
         no force or effect if:

         (a)      The Administrator,  in his or her sole discretion,  determines
                  that  an  Eligible   Director  or  the  Policyholder  has  not
                  adequately   cooperated   in  the  process  of  procuring  the
                  Insurance  Policy on the Eligible  Director's life as required
                  by Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively; or

         (b)      The Company is, for any reason,  unable to obtain insurance in
                  the  specified  amount  on  an  Eligible  Director's  life  at
                  standard rates or rates otherwise acceptable to the Company.

                             Incidents of Ownership

4.0      Policy  Ownership.  The Insurance  Policy shall, at all times, be owned
         solely and  absolutely by the  Policyholder,  except in the event of an
         assignment  to an Assignee as provided  for in Section 4.2. The person,
         trust,  entity  or  organization  that  will be the  Policyholder  with
         respect to a Participant shall be determined as follows:

         (a)      Eligible  Director Who Was Covered Under A Prior Policy. If an
                  Eligible  Director was a participant  in the Prior Program and
                  was  covered  as an  insured  under a Prior  Policy on May 31,
                  2000,  the policy owner (or  assignee) of such Prior Policy on
                  May 31,  2000 shall be the  Eligible  Director's  Policyholder
                  under the  Program  of the  Insurance  Policy on the  Eligible
                  Director's life to be procured in accordance with Section 3.0.

         (b)      Eligible Director Who Was Not Covered Under A Prior Policy. If
                  an Eligible  Director  was not  covered as an insured  under a
                  Prior  Policy  on  May  31,  2000,  the  Eligible   Director's
                  Policyholder  under the Program shall be the person (including
                  the Eligible Director), trust, entity or organization that the
                  Eligible Director  designates to be his or her Policyholder in
                  the Eligible  Director's  written  enrollment  application for
                  participation in the Program.  If, for any reason, an Eligible
                  Director  who  was not  covered  as an  insured  under a Prior
                  Policy on May 31,  2000,  fails to  designate  a  Policyholder
                  under  the  Program,   the  Eligible  Director  shall  be  the
                  Policyholder  with respect to the  Insurance  Policy on his or
                  her life.

4.1      Rights of Policyholder  and Company.  Prior to a  Participant's  Normal
         Termination Date, the Policyholder or his or her Assignee shall control
         all  incidents  of  ownership  with  respect  to the  Insurance  Policy
         including all policy cash values and death benefits under the Insurance
         Policy  on  the  Participant's   life.   However,   in  the  event  the
         Policyholder  or his or her Assignee  surrenders the Insurance  Policy,
         withdraws  any cash value from the  Insurance  Policy or obtains a loan
         from the  Insurance  Policy,  the  Participant's  participation  in the
         Program shall  immediately  cease and the Company will not be obligated
         to  continue  to make any further  premium  payments  on the  Insurance
         Policy as otherwise provided for by Section 5.1.

4.2      Assignment of Insurance  Policy by Policyholder.  A Policyholder  shall
         have the right, at any time, to absolutely and  irrevocably  assign his
         or her rights,  title,  interest,  and incidents of ownership in and to
         the Insurance Policy and any other assignable  rights to benefits under
         this  Program  to  any  person,  trust,  entity  or  organization.  Any
         assignment  shall be subject to the  consent of the  Insurer.  Any such
         assignment shall be on a form approved by the Insurer. No assignment by
         a Policyholder  shall be effective until acknowledged in writing by the
         Insurer. A copy of the written  acknowledgment shall be returned to the
         Policyholder  and the  Assignee.  Once the  assignment of the Insurance
         Policy has been  acknowledged by the Insurer,  the  Policyholder  shall
         have no further rights, title, interest or incidents of ownership, both
         present and future,  in or under the  Insurance  Policy or to any other
         rights to benefits under the Program covered by the assignment, and the
         Assignee  shall have all such assigned  rights,  title,  interest,  and
         incidents of  ownership,  both present and future,  under the Insurance
         Policy and the Program.
<PAGE>
4.3      Beneficiary  Elections and Settlement Options. A Policyholder or his or
         her Assignee, if any, may exercise (a) the right to designate or change
         the Beneficiary of life insurance  proceeds under the Insurance  Policy
         pursuant to Section 5.4;  and (b) the right to elect any optional  mode
         of  settlement  with  respect  to such life  insurance  proceeds.  Upon
         request  of a  Policyholder  or  his  or  her  Assignee,  if  any,  the
         applicable  form for any  designation  or change of  Beneficiary or any
         election  of  an  optional  mode  of  settlement  shall  be  sent  to a
         Policyholder, an Assignee or a Beneficiary, as appropriate.

4.4      No Ownership Interest by the Company. No provision in the Program shall
         be construed or  interpreted  to permit or provide the Company with any
         present or future rights,  title, interest or incidents of ownership to
         the Insurance Policy.

                              Payment of Benefits

5.0      Source  of  Benefits.   The  sole  benefits  under  the  Program  to  a
         Participant  shall be (a) the premium  payments  made by the Company to
         the Insurer pursuant to Section 5.1 to maintain the Insurance Policy on
         his or her life; and (b) the tax  adjustments  made pursuant to Section
         5.3. A Beneficiary's sole source of benefits under the Program shall be
         the  Insurance  Policy  under  which  the  Policyholder,  or his or her
         Assignee, designates a Beneficiary to receive benefits payable upon the
         Participant's death.

5.1      Payment of Insurance  Premiums.  The Company shall pay the premiums (if
         any)  determined to be due on the  Insurance  Policy from time to time.
         While  the  Eligible  Director  is a  Participant,  the  amount  of the
         premiums  paid  by  the  Company  on  the  Insurance  Policy  shall  be
         sufficient,  as  determined by the Company in its sole  discretion,  to
         maintain life insurance  coverage on the life of the Participant  equal
         to the  Benefit  Amount.  The  Company's  obligation  to  make  premium
         payments on the  Insurance  Policy  covering the life of a  Participant
         shall cease upon the termination of the Participant's participation, as
         provided for in Section 6.0.

5.2      Benefit Amount.

         (a)      Active  Non-Employee  Directors  Prior to Age 70: The  Benefit
                  Amount  for  a  Participant  who  is  actively  serving  as  a
                  non-employee member of the Board prior to attainment of age 70

                           her Transition Benefit Amount,  increased annually by
                           seven percent (7%)  beginning on January 1, 2001, and
                           on  January  1  of  each  successive  year  occurring
                           thereafter  prior  to  the  first  to  occur  of  the
                           Participant's   (A)  Normal   Termination  Date;  (B)
                           attainment of age 70; or (C) death.

                  (ii)     Individuals Who Become Active Non-Employee  Directors

                           Participant  who first  becomes an Eligible  Director

                           increased by seven percent (7%)  annually  thereafter
                           on January 1 of each  successive year occurring after
                           he or she first  becomes  an  Eligible  Director  and
                           prior to the first to occur of the  Participant's (A)

                           annual  percentage  increase  in the  Benefit  Amount
                           under Section 5.2(a)(i) and Section  5.2(a)(ii) shall
                           be based on the  Participant's  Benefit  Amount as of
                           the immediately preceding December 31.
<PAGE>
         (b)      Individuals Who Are Active  Non-Employee  Directors Age 70 and
                  Older:  The  Benefit  Amount  for a  Participant  who  (i)  is
                  actively serving as a non-employee  member of the Board,  (ii)
                  is age 70 or  older,  and (iii)  has not  attained  his or her
                  Normal  Termination Date, shall be equal to his or her Benefit
                  Amount  determined  under  Section  5.2(a)  on the  January  1
                  coinciding  with or  immediately  preceding the  Participant's
                  attainment of age 70.

                  Participant who has ceased to be an active non-employee member
                  of the Board but who is eligible for  continued  participation
                  in the Program  (pursuant to the  provisions of either Section
                  2.1 or Section 2.2 due to retirement  or  disability  prior to
                  attainment  of his or her  Normal  Termination  Date)  will be
                  equal  to his or  her  Benefit  Amount  as of  the  January  1
                  immediately  preceding  his or her  cessation of service as an
                  active non-employee member of the Board.

5.3      Tax Adjustment. The Company shall make a tax adjustment with respect to
         each premium payment made to the Insurer pursuant to Section 5.1 on the
         Insurance  Policy  covering the life of a  Participant.  The amount and
         frequency of each tax  adjustment,  as determined by the Company in its
         sole  discretion,  is intended to be  sufficient to cover the estimated
         amount of federal income taxes that will be incurred by the Participant
         on the sum of the premium payment plus the tax adjustment itself.  Each
         tax adjustment  payment shall be paid in cash to the Participant (or if
         he or she is not then  living,  to his or her  estate).  The  Company's
         obligation  to  make  tax   adjustment   payments  with  respect  to  a
         Participant  shall  cease  upon the  termination  of the  Participant's
         participation in the Program pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.0.

5.4      Beneficiary  Designations.  A Policyholder  or, if the Policyholder has
         assigned the Insurance Policy pursuant to Section 4.2, the Assignee may
         designate a Beneficiary  to receive life  insurance  proceeds under the
         Insurance  Policy upon the death of the  Participant,  or may change an
         existing  designation  of the  Beneficiary  to receive  such  insurance
         proceeds.  Any  designation  of Beneficiary or change in the designated
         Beneficiary  shall be  accomplished  in accordance  with the applicable
         terms of the Insurance Policy using forms approved by the Insurer.  If,
         for any reason,  no valid  Beneficiary  designation is on file with the
         Insurer  at the time of the  Participant's  death,  the life  insurance
         proceeds payable under the Insurance Policy shall be paid in accordance
         with the terms of the Insurance Policy.

5.5      No Company  Obligation.  The Company  shall have no  obligation  of any
         nature  whatsoever  to  a  Policyholder  or  his  or  her  Assignee  or
         Beneficiary   under   this   Program  if  the   circumstances   of  the
         Participant's  death, the terms and conditions of this Program,  or any
         other reason, precludes payment of life insurance proceeds or any other
         benefits under the Insurance Policy or Program.

5.6      No Affect on Other Company Benefits.  No portion of any premium payment
         on any Insurance Policy or any tax adjustment payment made with respect
         to a  Participant  as provided  in this  Section 5 shall be included or
         otherwise taken into  consideration as pay,  compensation or income for
         purposes  of  any  other  compensation  or  benefit  plan,  program  or
         arrangement  of the Company (if any)  covering the  Participant  unless
         expressly provided for in such plan, program or arrangement.

                  premium  payments with respect to the Insurance  Policy on the
                  Participant's life pursuant to Section 5.1.

         (b)      The  Policyholder's  Beneficiary  shall be entitled to receive

6.2      Attainment of Normal  Termination  Date. If a Participant  continues to

                  coverage   throughout   the   Participant's   remaining   life
                  expectancy  at a  level  amount  equal  to  the  Participant's

                  Normal Termination Date.

         (c)      The  restrictions  in  Section  4.1  on  the  Policyholder  or

                  retain  the  Insurance  Policy  with the cash value and policy
                  rights  and  options  as  of  the  date  of   termination   of
                  participation  in the  Program.  The  Company  shall  have  no
                  obligation  to pay  additional  premiums or increase  the cash
                  value so as to provide cash values  sufficient to continue any
                  level of coverage  under the Insurance  Policy  throughout the
                  Participant's   remaining  life   expectancy.   The  Insurance
                  Policy's  cash value  (whether  above or below any  estimates,
                  projections or  illustrations)  shall be limited solely to the
                  cash  value  of  the  Insurance  Policy  on  the  date  of the
                  Participant's termination of participation in the Program.

         (c)      The  restrictions  in  Section  4.1  on  the  Policyholder  or
                  Assignee  pertaining  to the exercise of certain  incidents of
                  ownership of the Insurance  Policy on the  Participant's  life
                  (e.g., loans and withdrawals) shall no longer apply.

                                       7.
                               Claims and Appeals

7.0      Claims.  A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit
         to which he or she is entitled under this Program (hereinafter referred
         to as a  "Claimant")  may file a written  request for such benefit with
         the Company's  Executive  Compensation & Benefits  Department,  setting
         forth his or her claim.  The request must be addressed to the Company's
         Executive  Compensation  & Benefits  Department  at its then  principal
         place of business.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any  Beneficiary's
         claim for payment of life insurance  proceeds from an Insurance  Policy
         on a  Participant's  life shall not be  considered a claim for benefits
         under this Program.  Any such claim for life insurance  proceeds should
         be filed with the Insurer in accordance  with the terms and  provisions
         of the applicable Insurance Policy.

7.1      Claim  Decision.  Upon  receipt  of a claim,  the  Company's  Executive
         Compensation  & Benefits  Department  shall advise the Claimant  that a
         reply will be forthcoming  within ninety (90) days and shall,  in fact,
         deliver  such  reply  within  such  period.  The  Company's   Executive
         Compensation  &  Benefits  Department  may,  however,  extend the reply
         period for up to an additional ninety (90) days for reasonable cause.

         If the  claim is  denied  by the  Company's  Executive  Compensation  &
         Benefits  Department,  in  whole or in part,  the  Company's  Executive
         Compensation  & Benefits  Department  shall provide a written  response
         using  language  designed to be  understood by the Claimant and setting
         forth: (a) the specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b) specific
         references to pertinent provisions of this Program on which such denial
         is based;  (c) a description of any additional  material or information
         necessary  for  the  Claimant  to  perfect  his  or  her  claim  and an
         explanation of why such material or such information is necessary;  (d)
         appropriate  information  as to the  steps to be taken if the  Claimant
         wishes to submit  the claim for  review;  and (e) the time  limits  for
         requesting a review under Section 7.2 and for performance of the review
         under Section 7.3.

7.2      Request  for  Review.  Within  sixty (60) days after the receipt by the
         Claimant of the written  opinion  described  above,  the  Claimant  may
         request in writing that the  Administrator  review the determination of
         the  Company's  Executive  Compensation  &  Benefits  Department.  Such
         request  must be  addressed  to the  Administrator  at the  address for
         giving  notice to the  Administrator  designated  in Section  9.3.  The
         Claimant or his or her duly  authorized  representative  may,  but need
         not,  review the pertinent  documents and submit issues and comments in
         writing for  consideration by the  Administrator.  If the Claimant does
         not request a review of the Company's Executive Compensation & Benefits
         Department's  determination by the Administrator within such sixty (60)
         day period,  the Claimant shall be barred and estopped from challenging
         the  determination of the Company's  Executive  Compensation & Benefits
         Department.

7.3      Review of Decision.  Within  sixty (60) days after the  Administrator's
         receipt of a request  for  review,  the  Administrator  will review the
         determination  of  the  Company's  Executive  Compensation  &  Benefits
         Department.  After considering all materials presented by the Claimant,
         the  Administrator  will render a written opinion,  written in a manner
<PAGE>
         designed to be understood  by the Claimant,  setting forth the specific
         reasons for the  decision and  containing  specific  references  to the
         pertinent provisions of this Program on which the decision is based. If
         special  circumstances  require  that the sixty (60) day time period be
         extended, the Administrator will so notify the Claimant and will render
         the decision as soon as possible,  but no later than one hundred twenty
         (120) days after receipt of the request for review.

         The  Administrator  shall serve as the final review committee under the
         Program and shall have sole and  complete  discretionary  authority  to
         determine  conclusively  for all parties,  and in  accordance  with the
         terms of the documents or  instruments  governing the Program,  any and
         all  questions   arising  from   administration   of  the  Program  and
         interpretation  of  all  Program   provisions,   determination  of  all
         questions   relating  to  participation   of  Eligible   Directors  and
         eligibility  for benefits,  determination  of all relevant  facts,  the
         amount and type of  benefits  payable to any  Participant,  Assignee or
         Beneficiary,  and  the  construction  of  all  terms  of  the  Program.
         Decisions by the  Administrator  shall be conclusive and binding on all
         parties and not subject to further review.

         The Program provisions  require that Participants  pursue all claim and
         appeal rights described above before they seek any other legal recourse
         regarding claims for benefits.

                            Amendment and Termination

8.0      Continuation   of  Program.   The  Company  does  not   guarantee   the
         continuation  of  the  Program  or  any  benefits  during  an  Eligible
         Director's  period of service as a non-employee  member of the Board or
         at or during  retirement,  nor does the Company  guarantee any specific
         level of  benefits.  Benefits  are  provided  under the  Program at the
         Company's  discretion  and do not  create  a  contract  of  employment.
         Neither  the  establishment  nor the  continuance  of the Plan shall be
         construed as conferring any legal rights upon any Eligible  Director or
         any other person, nor shall such establishment or continuance interfere
         with the right to discharge any Eligible Director.  The Company intends
         to continue the Program  indefinitely;  however, the Board reserves the
         right to amend or terminate the Program at any time pursuant to Section
         8.1.

8.1      Amendment or Termination. The Board or pursuant to delegated authority,
         the  Chairman  of the  Board  (or in his  absence  the  Executive  Vice
         President - Human Resources)  ("Delegate"),  may amend, modify, suspend
         or  change  the  Program  from  time to  time,  and the  Board  (or its
         Delegate) may terminate the Program at any time. Program amendments may
         include,  but are not limited to, elimination or reduction in the level
         or type of benefits  provided  to any class or classes of  non-employee
         members of the Board.

         application  of any  provision  of the  Program to any other  person or

                             Incidents of Ownership

4.0      Policy  Ownership.  The Insurance  Policy shall, at all times, be owned
         solely and  absolutely by the  Policyholder,  except in the event of an
         assignment  to an Assignee as provided  for in Section 4.2. The person,
         trust,  entity  or  organization  that  will be the  Policyholder  with
         respect to a Participant shall be determined as follows:

         (a)      Eligible Former  Executive Who  Participated in Prior Programs
                  with Single  Policy  Owner.  If on  September  30, 1999 (i) an
                  Eligible Former  Executive was covered as an insured under one
                  or  more  life  insurance  policies  that  are  subject  to  a
                  collateral  assignment  with the Company  under one or both of
                  the Prior Programs,  and (ii) all such life insurance policies
                  were owned by a single policy owner (or assignee), such policy
                  owner (or assignee) shall be the Eligible  Former  Executive's
                  Policyholder under the Program.

         (b)      Eligible Former  Executive Who  Participated in Prior Programs
                  with Multiple  Policy Owners.  If on September 30, 1999 (i) an
                  Eligible Former  Executive was covered as an insured under one
                  or  more  life  insurance  policies  that  are  subject  to  a
                  collateral  assignment agreement with the Company under one or
                  both of the Prior  Programs,  and (ii) all such life insurance
                  policies were owned by two or more different policy owners (or
                  assignees), the Eligible Former Executive's Policyholder under
                  the Program shall be the person, trust, entity or organization
                  that all of such policy  owners or  assignees  (excluding  the
                  Eligible  Former  Executive  if he or she is one of the policy
                  owners)  agree upon and  designate  as the  Policyholder  with
                  respect to the Eligible Former Executive.  If, for any reason,
                  an agreement among such policy owners (or assignees) cannot be
                  reached  by  October  1,  1999,   and/or  no   designation  of
                  Policyholder  is received by the  Administrator  by October 1,
                  1999, the Eligible Former  Executive shall be the Policyholder
                  unless  the  Administrator,  in his or  her  sole  discretion,
                  determines that one or more other persons, trusts, entities or
                  organizations  should be the Policyholder  with respect to the
                  Insurance Policy on the Eligible Former Executive's life.

4.1      Rights of Policyholder  and Company.  Prior to a  Participant's  Normal
         Termination Date, the Policyholder or his or her Assignee shall control
         all  incidents  of  ownership  with  respect  to the  Insurance  Policy
         including all policy cash values and death benefits under the Insurance
         Policy  on  the  Participant's   life.   However,   in  the  event  the
         Policyholder  or his or her Assignee  surrenders the Insurance  Policy,
         withdraws  any cash value from the  Insurance  Policy or obtains a loan
         from the  Insurance  Policy,  the  Participant's  participation  in the
         Program  shall  immediately  cease and Company will not be obligated to
         continue  to make any further  premium  payments as provided by Section
         5.1 for the Insurance Policy.

4.2      Assignment of Insurance  Policy by Policyholder.  A Policyholder  shall
         have the right, at any time, to absolutely and  irrevocably  assign his
         or her rights,  title,  interest,  and incidents of ownership in and to
         the Insurance Policy and any other assignable  rights to benefits under
         this  Program  to  any  person,  trust,  entity  or  organization.  Any
         assignment  shall be subject to the  consent of the  Insurer.  Any such
<PAGE>
         assignment shall be on a form approved by the Insurer. No assignment by
         a Policyholder  shall be effective until acknowledged in writing by the
         Insurer. A copy of the written  acknowledgment shall be returned to the
         Policyholder  and the  Assignee.  Once the  assignment of the Insurance
         Policy has been  acknowledged by the Insurer,  the  Policyholder  shall
         have no further rights, title, interest or incidents of ownership, both
         present and future,  in or under the  Insurance  Policy or to any other
         rights to benefits under the Program covered by the assignment, and the
         Assignee  shall have all such assigned  rights,  title,  interest,  and
         incidents of  ownership,  both present and future,  under the Insurance
         Policy and the Program.

4.3      Beneficiary  Elections and Settlement Options. A Policyholder or his or
         her Assignee, if any, may exercise (a) the right to designate or change
         the Beneficiary of life insurance  proceeds under the Insurance  Policy
         pursuant to Section 5.4;  and (b) the right to elect any optional  mode
         of  settlement  with  respect  to such life  insurance  proceeds.  Upon
         request  of a  Policyholder  or  his  or  her  Assignee,  if  any,  the
         applicable  form for any  designation  or change of  Beneficiary or any
         election  of  an  optional  mode  of  settlement  shall  be  sent  to a
         Policyholder, an Assignee or a Beneficiary, as appropriate.

4.4      No Ownership Interest by the Company. No provision in the Program shall
         be construed or  interpreted  to permit or provide the Company with any
         rights,  title,  interest or  incidents of  ownership,  both present or
         future, to the Insurance Policy.

                              Payment of Benefits

5.0      Source of Benefits. The sole benefit under the Program to a Participant
         shall  be the  premium  payments  made by the  Company  to the  Insurer
         pursuant to Section 5.1 to maintain the Insurance  Policy on his or her
         life and the tax adjustment to be made in accordance  with Section 5.3.
         A Beneficiary's  sole source of benefits under the Program shall be the
         Insurance Policy under which the Policyholder,  or his or her Assignee,
         designates  a  Beneficiary  to  receive   benefits   payable  upon  the
         Participant's death.

5.1      Payment of Insurance Premiums.  When the Company submits an application
         for the Insurance  Policy on the life of an Eligible Former  Executive,
         or as soon thereafter as is required by the Insurer,  the Company shall
         pay  the  initial  premium  on the  Insurance  Policy  to the  Insurer.
         Thereafter,  the Company shall annually (or more frequently as required
         by the  Insurer)  pay  the  premiums  determined  to be due  under  the
         Insurance Policy. While the Eligible Former Executive is a Participant,
         the amount of the premiums paid by the Company shall be sufficient,  as
         determined  by the Company in its sole  discretion,  to  maintain  life
         insurance  coverage on the life of the Participant equal to the Benefit
         Amount.  The  Company's  obligation  to make  premium  payments  on the
         Insurance  Policy  covering the life of a Participant  shall cease upon
         the termination of the Participant's participation,  as provided for in
         Section 6.0.

5.2      Benefit Amount.  The Benefit Amount under the Program with respect to a
         Participant  shall  be  equal  to  the  Participant's   aggregate  life
         insurance  benefit  amount under the Prior  Programs on  September  30,
         1999.

5.3      Tax Adjustment. The Company shall make a tax adjustment with respect to
         each premium payment made to the Insurer pursuant to Section 5.1 on the
         Insurance  Policy  covering the life of a  Participant.  The amount and
         frequency of each tax  adjustment,  as determined by the Company in its
         sole  discretion,  is intended to be  sufficient to cover the estimated
         amount of federal  income taxes and FICA taxes that will be incurred by
         the  Participant  on the  sum of  the  premium  payment  plus  the  tax
         adjustment itself. Each tax adjustment shall be equal to the sum of two
         amounts that are described below and referred to herein respectively as
         the "tax withholding portion" and the "excess portion":

         (a)      Tax Withholding Portion of Tax Adjustment: The tax withholding
                  portion of each tax adjustment  shall be equal to the combined
                  total amount of federal  income taxes and FICA taxes  required
                  to be withheld  with respect to (i) each premium  payment made
                  by the Company; and (ii) each corresponding tax adjustment.

          (b)     Excess Portion of Tax  Adjustment:  The excess portion of each
                  tax   adjustment   shall  be  equal  to  the   applicable  tax
                  adjustment,  reduced by the related tax withholding portion of
                  such tax  adjustment  determined  under  Section  5.3(a)  with
                  respect to the premium payment and the related tax adjustment.

         The  tax  withholding  portion  of  each  tax  adjustment  payment,  as
         described  in  Section  5.3(a)  (above),  shall be paid by the  Company
<PAGE>
         directly to the applicable federal tax authorities.  The excess portion
         of each tax adjustment payment, as described in Section 5.3(b) (above),
         shall be paid in cash to the  Participant  (or if he or she is not then
         living,  to his or her estate).  The  Company's  obligation to make tax
         adjustment  payments with respect to a Participant shall cease upon the
         termination of the Participant's  participation in the Program pursuant
         to the provisions of Section 6.0.

5.4      Beneficiary  Designations.  A Policyholder  or, if the Policyholder has
         assigned the Insurance Policy pursuant to Section 4.2, the Assignee may
         designate a Beneficiary  to receive life  insurance  proceeds under the
         Insurance  Policy upon the death of the  Participant,  or may change an
         existing  designation  of the  Beneficiary  to receive  such  insurance
         proceeds.  Any  designation  of Beneficiary or change in the designated
         Beneficiary  shall be  accomplished  in accordance  with the applicable
         terms of the Insurance Policy using forms approved by the Insurer.  If,
         for any reason,  no valid  Beneficiary  designation is on file with the
         Insurer  at the time of the  Participant's  death,  the life  insurance
         proceeds payable under the Insurance Policy shall be paid in accordance
         with the terms of the Insurance Policy.

5.5      No Company or  Employer  Obligation.  Neither the Company nor any other
         Employer  shall  have any  obligation  of any  nature  whatsoever  to a
         Policyholder  or his or her Assignee or Beneficiary  under this Program
         if  the  circumstances  of  the  Participant's  death,  the  terms  and
         conditions of this Program,  or any other reason  precludes  payment of
         life  insurance  proceeds  or any other  benefits  under the  Insurance
         Policy or Program.

5.6      No Affect on Other Company Benefits:  No portion of any premium payment
         on any Insurance Policy or any tax adjustment payment made with respect
         to a  Participant  as provided  in this  Section 5 shall be included or
         otherwise taken into  consideration as pay,  compensation or income for
         purposes  of any other  "employee  welfare  benefit  plan"  (within the
         meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA),  any "employee pension benefit plan"
         (within  the  meaning  of  Section   3(2)  of  ERISA),   or  any  other
         compensation  or benefit plan,  program or  arrangement  of the Company
         covering the Participant  unless  expressly  provided for in such plan,
         program or arrangement.

6.0      Events  that  Cause  Termination  of  Participation.   A  Participant's
         participation  in the Program shall  terminate when the first of any of

                  Date (unless otherwise agreed to by the Company in writing);

         (e)      The Policyholder or his or her Assignee,  if any, takes any of
                  the  actions   described  in  Section  4.1  (e.g.,   loans  or
                  withdrawals)  that  cause  termination  of  the  Participant's
                  participation in the Program; or

         (f)      The   Participant   is  determined   by  the  Executive   Vice
                  President-Human  Resources of the Company,  in his or her sole
                  discretion,  to have engaged in any competitive  activity that

         terminates  due to death  (as  provided  in  Section  6.0(a))  prior to
         attainment of his or her Normal  Termination Date, then effective as of
         the date of death:

         (a)      The  Company  shall  have no  further  obligation  to make any
                  premium  payments with respect to the Insurance  Policy on the

                  coverage   throughout   the   Participant's   remaining   life
                  expectancy.

         (c)      The  restrictions  in  Section  4.1  on  the  Policyholder  or

                  value so as to provide cash values  sufficient to continue any
                  level of coverage  under the Insurance  Policy  throughout the
                  Participant's remaining life expectancy.

                                       7.
                               Claims and Appeals

7.0      Claims.  A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit
         to which he or she is entitled under this Program (hereinafter referred
         to as a  "Claimant")  may file a written  request for such benefit with
         the Company's Executive Human Resources  Department,  setting forth his
         or her claim. The request must be addressed to the Company's  Executive
         Human  Resources  Department at its then  principal  place of business.
         Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any Beneficiary's claim for payment of
         life  insurance  proceeds from an Insurance  Policy on a  Participant's
         life shall not be  considered a claim for benefits  under this Program.
         Any such  claim for life  insurance  proceeds  should be filed with the
         Insurer in accordance  with the terms and  provisions of the applicable
         Insurance Policy.

7.1      Claim Decision.  Upon receipt of a claim, the Company's Executive Human
         Resources  Department  shall advise the  Claimant  that a reply will be
         forthcoming  within ninety (90) days and shall,  in fact,  deliver such
         reply within such  period.  The  Company's  Executive  Human  Resources
         Department  may,  however,  extend  the  reply  period  for  up  to  an
         additional ninety (90) days for reasonable cause.

         If the claim is  denied  by the  Company's  Executive  Human  Resources
         Department,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  Company's  Executive  Human
         Resources  Department  shall provide a written  response using language
         calculated to be understood by the Claimant and setting forth:  (a) the
         specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b) specific  references to
         pertinent provisions of this Program on which such denial is based; (c)
         a description of any additional  material or information  necessary for
         the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such
         material or such information is necessary;  (d) appropriate information
         as to the steps to be taken if the Claimant  wishes to submit the claim
         for  review;  and (e) the time  limits for  requesting  a review  under
         Section 7.2 and for review under Section 7.3.

7.2      Request  for  Review.  Within  sixty (60) days after the receipt by the
         Claimant of the written  opinion  described  above,  the  Claimant  may
         request in writing that the  Administrator  review the determination of
         the Company's Executive Human Resources  Department.  Such request must
         be addressed to the  Administrator  at the address for giving notice to
         the Administrator designated in Section 9.3. The Claimant or his or her
         duly authorized  representative may, but need not, review the pertinent
         documents and submit  issues and comments in writing for  consideration
         by the Administrator.  If the Claimant does not request a review of the
         Company's Executive Human Resources  Department's  determination by the
         Administrator  within such sixty (60) day period, the Claimant shall be
         barred and estopped from challenging the determination of the Company's
         Executive Human Resources Department.

7.3      Review of Decision.  Within  sixty (60) days after the  Administrator's
         receipt of a request  for  review,  the  Administrator  will review the
         determination  of the Company's  Executive Human Resources  Department.
         After  considering  all  materials  presented  by  the  Claimant,   the
         Administrator  will  render  a  written  opinion,  written  in a manner
         designed to be understood  by the Claimant,  setting forth the specific
         reasons for the  decision and  containing  specific  references  to the
<PAGE>
         pertinent provisions of this Program on which the decision is based. If
         special  circumstances  require  that the sixty (60) day time period be
         extended, the Administrator will so notify the Claimant and will render
         the decision as soon as possible,  but no later than one hundred twenty
         (120) days after receipt of the request for review.

         The  Administrator  shall serve as the final review committee under the
         Program and shall have sole and  complete  discretionary  authority  to
         determine  conclusively  for all parties,  and in  accordance  with the
         terms of the documents or  instruments  governing the Program,  any and
         all  questions   arising  from   administration   of  the  Program  and
         interpretation  of  all  Program   provisions,   determination  of  all
         questions  relating to participation of Eligible Former  Executives and
         eligibility  for benefits,  determination  of all relevant  facts,  the
         amount and type of  benefits  payable to any  Participant,  Assignee or
         Beneficiary,  and  the  construction  of  all  terms  of  the  Program.
         Decisions by the  Administrator  shall be conclusive and binding on all
         parties and not subject to further review.

         In any case, a  Participant  may have further  rights under ERISA.  The
         Program  provisions  require  that  Participants  pursue  all claim and
         appeal rights described above before they seek any other legal recourse
         regarding claims for benefits.

         or type of benefits provided to any class or classes of employees.

Charles H. Noski
c/o AT&T Corp.

295 North Maple Avenue
Basking Ridge, NJ 07920

Dear Chuck:

         It gives me great  pleasure to offer you a Senior  Management  position
within AT&T (the  "Company").  In addition to confirming  my offer,  this letter
will detail the terms and conditions of your  employment and outline the current
major features of AT&T's compensation and benefit plans and practices.

Assumption of Duties: Effective no later than December 31, 1999, ("the Effective
Date") you will assume the position of Senior  Executive  Vice President & Chief
Financial  Officer - AT&T.  You will report to the Chairman and Chief  Executive
Officer - AT&T (currently Mike Armstrong) and your work location will be Basking
Ridge, New Jersey.

Base Salary:  Your initial base salary will be $750,000 per year. This rate will
be reviewed  annually for increase to reflect  individual  performance  and base
salary structure  changes  applicable to Senior Managers.  Your first review for
your base salary level will be effective March, 2001. Your base salary shall not
be reduced at any time.

Annual  Bonus:  The  Annual  Bonus for Senior  Managers  is  currently  based on
measures of Company,  unit, and individual  performance and is paid in cash. The
2000 target (not  actual)  Annual  Bonus for your  position is 100% of your base
salary or $750,000. While the 2000 Annual Bonus will be prorated for any partial
service in 2000, you will be provided a special lump sum amount at the time 2000
bonuses are paid such that the sum of your actual earned prorated bonus plus the
special  lump sum amount will equal what a full year  earned  2000 Annual  Bonus
would have been for you if not for the  prorate.  In no event  will your  annual
bonus for 2000 be less than $750,000.

In the event any  portion of your 1999 Annual  Bonus to be paid by your  current
employer  is  forfeited,  you will be  provided  a lump sum amount no later than
March 30, 2000 equal to the difference  between $650,000 and any amount actually
paid by your  current  employer.  This  payment  will not be credited for AT&T's
Qualified  Pension  Plan,  but will be considered  compensation  for purposes of
calculating the Special Supplemental Pension.

Hiring  Bonus:  You will be provided  with a special,  one-time  hiring bonus of
$2,000,000.  This bonus will be paid 50% within 30 days from your effective date
of hire and the  remaining  50% will be paid after 6 months  from your hire date
whether or not you are then  employed by AT&T (other than if you are  terminated
for Cause or voluntarily resign without Good Reason).

Long Term Incentives

Under the current guidelines for long-term incentives for comparable executives,
your annual target long-term incentive  opportunity is 3 times your base salary,
or $2,250,000.  This incentive is currently awarded in two forms;  non-qualified
stock  options and  performance  share units and is calculated at 60% and 40% of
the  total  long-term  incentive,   respectively.   According  to  this  current
methodology the value of your stock option award equals  $1,350,000.  That value
is divided by the AT&T  Black-Scholes  value of 33% of the stock price to derive
the number of options.  Likewise,  the target  value of your  performance  share
award equals $900,000 and is converted into performance  shares by dividing this
value by the fair market value of a share of AT&T common stock. These awards are
made as follows:

AT&T Performance Shares:  Effective on the regularly scheduled annual grant date
for AT&T and subject to approval by the  Compensation  Committee of the Board of
Directors,  you  will  receive  18,900  AT&T  Performance  Shares  covering  the
2000-2002  performance period (payout, if any, is in the first quarter of 2003).
Performance   Shares  are   equivalent  in  value  to  AT&T  common  shares  and
historically, such awards have been made annually.

o    Assuming  continued Company  employment,  payout of from 0% to 200% of such
     Performance  Shares is made in the form of cash and AT&T  shares at the end
     of the  performance  period  based on a measure  of AT&T's  EPS and  EBITDA
     versus  commitment   targets  and  Total   Shareholder   Return  vs.  Total
     Shareholder Return for the S&P500 companies (where Total Shareholder Return
     is  defined  as share  price  appreciation  and  dividends),  or such other
     measure of financial  performance  as the Board may  determine,  during the
     three year performance period.

o Dividend  equivalents  are paid  quarterly  on all  undistributed  Performance
Shares.

AT&T Stock Options:  You will be awarded 86,000 AT&T Stock Options  effective on
your  hire  date as  consideration  for your  2000  long-term  incentive  award.
Historically,  standard  stock  option  grants have been made in January of each
year to Senior  Managers.  Currently,  the term of the stock option grant is ten
years.  Assuming continued Company employment,  stock options vest one-third per
year beginning on the third  anniversary of the grant.  The option price is 100%
of market price on date of grant. As with the Annual Bonus, Long-Term Incentives
are closely linked with the Company's strategy to meet the challenges of an ever
changing  marketplace.  Accordingly,  other than the Initial grant,  the Company
cannot  guarantee  continuation  of the Long Term  Incentive Plan in its current
format, nor can it guarantee annual grant levels to individual participants.

In order to mitigate forfeitures  associated with your departure from your prior

amount at least equal to the value at grant of the awards  referenced  above. In
the event that the above AT&T Seasoned Performance Shares pay out an amount less
than the value at grant of the awards referenced above, additional cash payments
will be immediately made to offset that difference.

each year for three years from date of grant,  with a term of 10 years,  will be

appreciation  opportunity on your current  employer's  vested and unvested stock

o    The Restricted Stock will vest contingent upon continued Company employment
     (there  are  no  performance  criteria)  or  otherwise  as  provided  under
     "Severance  Benefit"  below.  Dividends on these shares are currently  paid
     each quarter as part of the normal company dividend.

Stock  Units will be made on the date of hire to replace the  forfeited  bargain

o    These Units will vest contingent upon continued  Company  employment (there
     are no  performance  criteria) or otherwise  as provided  under  "Severance
     Benefit" below. Dividend equivalents on these Units are currently paid each
     quarter coincident with the normal company dividend.

o    The Restricted Stock and Stock Unit agreements (Attachment E as an example)
     will provide that certain  activities  which are detrimental to the Company
     (e.g.,  competing,  raiding,  suing) during  employment or within 24 months
     after termination may result in forfeiture of unvested  Restricted Stock or
     Restricted Stock Units, as provided in the AT&T Non-Competition Guidelines.
     Notwithstanding Attachment E, there shall be no forfeiture or clawback with
     regard to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that have vested.
<PAGE>
It is understood that you will exercise your currently vested  outstanding stock
options from your  current  employer,  except  those shares  subject to clawback
under your current  long-term  incentive  plan  (136,609 of the  10/17/97  Stock
Options  granted at $37.87/share as retention and vesting 25% per year beginning
10/17/98).  To mitigate  forfeitures  associated  with the vested portion of the
above-referenced  award subject to clawback, the Company will provide you with a
special lump sum cash payment of $1,561,250 payable 30 days after your hire date
and will grant you 96,274 Shares of  Restricted  Stock vesting 100% on the first
anniversary of your hire date. The Restricted  Stock will vest  contingent  upon
continued Company employment (there are no performance criteria) or otherwise as
provided  under  "Severance  Benefit"  below.  Dividends  on  these  shares  are
currently paid each quarter as part of the normal company dividend. In the event
your current employer tries to clawback or otherwise prevent realization of your
exercised  long-term  incentive plan awards,  any additional  forfeited  bargain
spread on your  vested  options or value of your  vested  restricted  stock that
cannot be recovered  through mutually  agreeable  remedies  available under your
existing  agreements will be replaced with an additional  restricted stock award
or a  combination  of  deferred  cash  and  restricted  stock  with  a  targeted
replacement  split of 25% cash with immediate  vesting and 75% restricted  stock
vesting 12 months from the grant.

In the event that your current employer's  policies preclude you from a cashless
exercise of certain vested options,  for a period not to exceed 12 months,  AT&T
will protect the bargain  spread (based on the average of the high and low stock
prices  recorded by the NYSE  ("FMV")) on such options  effective on the date of
the stock option exercise, provided the exercise is no later than your last date
of employment with your prior employer. In the event that the stock price on the
Date of Sale is less than the protected price, AT&T will provide you with a lump
sum payment equal to the difference between the "protected" price and the FMV on
the Date of Sale  multiplied  by the number of  options.  For  purposes  of this
protection  provision  only, the Date of Sale represents the date of actual sale
or, if earlier,  the date two (2) weeks  after the first date after  February 1,
2000 on which you may sell your  former  employer's  stock  (i.e.,  a new window
initially opens). The Company shall also reimburse you for the carrying costs of
exercising and holding these shares, including any applicable tax gross up.

Severance Benefit

(I) In the event of any Company-initiated termination, including termination for
Good Reason,  other than for "Long Term  Disability"  (as defined  below) or for
"Cause" (as defined below), you will be entitled to the following:

         1.       A "Severance Payment" equal to 200% of your annual base salary
                  and  target  annual  bonus  in  effect  on the  date  of  such
                  termination,  payable  in the  month  following  the  month of
                  termination  or such  greater  amount as then being paid under
                  the then existing  policies and/or practices  regarding Senior
                  Manager Severance Benefits.

         2.       Bonuses:  To  the extent all or a  portion of your cash hiring
                  bonus has not been  paid,  the  Company  will pay such  unpaid
                  amount  within  30  days  of  your  date  of  termination.  In
                  addition,  to the  extent  all or a  portion  of  your  annual
                  incentive  bonus for the current year and/or prior year if not
                  yet paid has not been  paid,  the  Company  will pay an amount
                  equal to the target  bonus  prorated  for the total  period of
                  eligibility  based on a  formula,  the  numerator  of which is
                  equal to the number of days in the  applicable  calendar  year
                  for which the bonus is being paid and the denominator of which
                  is 365 within 30 days of your  termination,  provided that, if
                  the bonus for the prior  year has been  declared  before  your
                  termination  and is higher than the target bonus,  it shall be
                  paid in lieu of the target bonus for the prior year.
<PAGE>
         3.       Long Term Incentive Awards:

                  -        Outstanding Performance Shares/Stock Units, including
                           those  granted  upon  your  hire,  are  retained  and
                           distributed at the end of each 3-year cycle. Dividend
                           equivalents  continue  to be paid until all units are
                           paid out.

                  -        Outstanding  Stock Options,  including  those granted
                           upon your hire,  are retained  and  unvested  options
                           continue  to  vest  as  if  active  and  will  remain
                           exercisable until expiration of the original term.

         4.       Restricted Stock/Unit Hire Grants:

                  -        Any outstanding  unvested  restricted  stock or stock
                           units (including any associated cash or deferred cash
                           amounts),  including  those granted upon your date of
                           hire,  will  continue  to vest as though  you were an
                           active employee.  Dividend equivalents continue to be
                           paid until all units are vested and paid out.

         5.       Cash Grants:

                  - Any  unvested  cash  awards  or other  cash  make-ups  shall
                    continue to vest as if you were an active employee.

(II) In the event of any  Company-initiated  termination,  including termination
for  "Good  Reason",  prior  to the  vesting  of your  benefits  under  the AT&T
Management Pension Plan and the AT&T  Non-Qualified  Pension Plan (including the
Special  Supplemental  Pension)  and the vesting of the Company  match under the
AT&T Long Term Savings Plan for Management Employees,  other than for "Long Term
Disability"  (as defined below) or for "Cause" (as defined  below),  you will be
entitled to the amount of the benefits  accrued,  but not vested, to the date of
your  termination  under the  above-mentioned  plans (but with credit  under the
Special  Supplemental Pension through age 57 if the termination is prior to that
date) will be paid out under an  individual  pension  arrangement  from  company
operating  income on the same basis as if you had  remained  in the  plans.  The
Severance  Benefits above due under this Severance  Benefit  provision (I AND II
ABOVE) will be  conditioned  upon your signing (and not  revoking) a release and
agreement not to sue the Company,  within 30 days of your termination.  The form
of this release and agreement will be that then in use for AT&T Senior Managers,
but will cover no items  except  those  purely  related to the  release  and the
release will not cover rights of  indemnification  or amounts due under  benefit
plans or programs.

(III) At the time of termination of employment,  relocation  expenses associated
with a move back to California,  including home sale and tax assistance  will be
provided  in  accordance  with the  Relocation  Policy in the same  manner as it
applies to your move to New Jersey.

(IV) In the event of your death or disability termination,  you will be entitled
to items I (other than 1), II and III above.

(V) In the event of your voluntary termination of employment within 12 months of
a material  restructuring of the executive  leadership of the Company, or a good
faith determination by you of an adverse change in the relationship  between the
CEO and CFO, any then vested and  outstanding  Stock  Options,  including  those
granted upon hire, will remain  exercisable until the sooner of three years from
the date of termination or until their original expiration date.
<PAGE>
(VI) In the event of your  voluntary  termination  of employment for reasons not
covered  by  the  above-referenced  provisions,  and in  acknowledgement  of the
material nature of Company  information you will possess,  you will have 30 days
after the end of any prohibited  trading period (to be determined by the General
Counsel  Office of the  Company) to exercise  any  outstanding  and vested stock
options otherwise  forfeitable  after 90 days from termination,  provided you in
good faith  believe the  prohibited  period  precludes  your ability to sell the
shares issued upon an exercise  within the 90 days and you so notify the General
Counsel's Office.

For purposes of this employment letter:

"Cause" shall be defined as follows:  (1) your  conviction  (including a plea of
guilty or nolo  contendere)  of a felony  involving  theft,  moral  turpitude or
relating to the business of the Company  other than a felony  predicated on your
vicarious  liability.  Vicarious liability means any liability which is based on
acts of the Company for which you are charged  solely as a result of your office
with the Company  and in which:  (i) you were not  directly  involved or did not
have prior  knowledge of such actions or inactions,  or (ii) counsel had advised
that the action or inaction was  permissible,  or (2) you engage in conduct that
constitutes  willful gross  neglect or willful gross  misconduct in carrying out

economic harm to the Company, its subsidiaries and divisions.

                         compensation  (i.e.,  annual base salary  rate,  target
                         annual  incentive and "Long Term  Incentive" (as valued
                         below)) to less than  $3,750,000.  For  purposes of the
                         prior sentence,  the dollar value of Employee's  annual
                         "Long Term  Incentive"  grants shall be  determined  by
                         valuing  Performance  Shares,  Performance Units, Stock
                         Units,  Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, etc.,
                         at the fair market  value  price when the  Compensation
                         Committee  approves  such  grants,  and  assuming  100%
                         performance   achievement   if  such   grants   include
                         performance criteria,  and by valuing Stock Options and
                         SARs at 33% of the fair  market  price of the shares or
                         related shares when the Compensation Committee approves
                         such grants, as applicable.


                  (ii)   The   assignment  to  you  of  any  duties inconsistent
                         with,   or,  any  substantial   alteration   in,   your
                         status or responsibilities  (other  than as a result of
                         your   mental  or  physical incapacity)  as  in  effect
                         immediately prior thereto.

                 (iii)   A change in your  reporting  relationship  that differs
                         from the reporting relationship described herein.

                  (iv)   A change  in your work  location  of more than 35 miles
                         from the work location as of the Effective Date.
<PAGE>
                   (v)   A diminution  in  title or  a  material  diminution  in
                         duties, authority or responsibilities.

                  (vi)   A  material  breach of  any  provisions  hereof  by the
                         Company.

All severance  amounts  shall be paid without any  obligation to mitigate or any
offset for other amounts earned.

Benefits and Special Mid-Career  Benefits:  You will, of course, be eligible for
the benefit programs  currently  available to all AT&T executives at your level,
and you will be eligible for future  compensation and benefit plans  established
for executives at your level based on the then current eligibility  requirements
established for participation in such future benefits. In addition,  you will be
entitled to a one-time  payment  (grossed-up  to reflect  taxes),  equivalent to
premiums  you will be charged for the Company  Medical  Expense  Plan and Dental
Plan during the period from your first  eligibility  (you are eligible to enroll
effective the first of the month following your one month service  anniversary),
until you become  eligible to  participate  in the AT&T  flexible  benefits plan
after six months of service.  In the event you want to continue  coverage  under
COBRA from your prior  employer  for this six month  period in lieu of the above
provided  payment,  the  Company  will  reimburse  you for your  COBRA  premiums
(grossed-up  to reflect  taxes) for up to six  months.  Until you are  initially
eligible to  participate  (as  described  above) in the AT&T  Medical and Dental
plans, you will need to make your own arrangements for medical and dental. After
the initial six-month period,  you will be eligible for the Company paid medical
and dental care coverage provided to all management employees.  In addition, you
will be entitled to five weeks annual vacation.

         In the event of your  termination  by the  Company  for other  than (a)
Cause,  (b)  death,  or (c)  Long  Term  Disability,  or in the  event  of  your
termination  of  employment  for Good Reason or your  voluntary  termination  of
employment  within  12  months  of a  material  restructuring  of the  executive
leadership of the Company,  or a good faith  determination  by you of an adverse
change in the  relationship  between the CEO and CFO,  and to the extent you are
not eligible to receive  retiree  medical  benefits from AT&T, you and your then
eligible  dependents  will be eligible  for coverage  under the AT&T  Separation
Medical Plan offered by the Company to certain  former Senior  Managers,  who at
the time of their  separation of employment,  are not eligible to participate in
the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for Retired Employees. You will be responsible for
a portion (30%  currently) of the annual premium for this medical care coverage.
As is the case  under  the AT&T  Medical  Expense  Plan for  Retired  Employees,
continuation of coverage under the AT&T Separation Medical Plan after your death
is  available  to your spouse by her paying 100% of the annual  premium for this
coverage.

         In the event of your  voluntary  termination  of employment for reasons
not covered in the  above-referenced  provisions,  and to the extent you are not
eligible  to receive  retiree  medical  benefits  from  AT&T,  you and your then
eligible  dependents  will be eligible  for coverage  under the AT&T  Separation
Medical Plan offered by the Company to certain  former Senior  Managers,  who at
the time of their  separation of employment,  are not eligible to participate in
the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for Retired Employees. You will be responsible for
100% of the annual premium for this medical care coverage.  As is the case under
the AT&T Medical  Expense Plan for Retired  Employees,  continuation of coverage
under the AT&T  Separation  Medical  Plan after your death is  available to your
spouse by her paying 100% of the annual premium for this coverage.

         Attachment  A outlines  the  benefits  available  to you under  various
Senior  Management,   mid-career  and  employee  benefit  plans,   programs  and
practices.
<PAGE>
         Special Pension:  AT&T will establish a Special Supplemental Pension to
address  forfeitures  from  your  current  retirement   benefit.   This  Special
Supplemental  Pension  will be subject to the terms and  conditions  detailed in
Attachment B.

         Relocation Plan:  You will be provided relocation assistance under Plan
B of the AT&T Management Relocation Plan as detailed in Attachment C.

         Special Temporary Allowance:  In order to mitigate the costs associated
with  temporarily  maintaining two residences and the commute required from your
primary  residence,  the  Company  will  pay  you a  monthly  Special  Temporary
Allowance   (STA)   equivalent  to  the  monthly  rent  you  pay  for  the  home
(house/apartment/townhouse) you rent in the Basking Ridge, New Jersey area or an
equivalent  hotel up to a maximum of $4,500 per month or  accommodations  at the
Short Hills,  NJ Hilton hotel  beginning with the first month of such rental and
continuing  as mutually  agreed  upon  between  you and the  Company.  The above
monthly STA  payments  will be  grossed-up  for taxes,  since such  payments are
taxable  income subject to tax  withholding.  These STA payments are only during
your continued  employment  with the Company and will not be included in the pay
base for calculating any employee or Senior Manager benefits.

         Other Travel  Related  Expenses:  In addition,  you will have access to
first  class  air  travel  or the  corporate  aircraft  for  travel to your home
location  during your interim living,  provided the flight schedule  permits and
normal  regularly  scheduled  flights  are not  disrupted  as a  result  of your
non-business  travel.  The Company will also reimburse you for reasonable travel
expenses  for you and/or  your family for up to a maximum of one (1) visit every
two (2) months during your interim living period.  In the event any of the above
travel expenses result in imputed income, the Company will provide tax gross-up.

         Other  Provisions:  It is  agreed  and  understood  that  you  will not
disclose the specific terms of this employment letter or any fact concerning its
negotiation or implementation, except in compliance with legal process, prior to
the information being made public by the Company. You may, however,  discuss the
contents of this letter with your spouse,  legal and/or financial  counselor and
the forfeiture provisions with any potential future employer.

         The Company  agrees to indemnify  you for all costs  (including  losses
specifically  associated with the  compensation and benefits  contained  herein)
relating to any action  brought by your  current  employer  related to: (1) your
termination of employment  with such employer,  and/or (2) your  employment with
the Company.

         As indicated in the attached AT&T Non-Competition Guideline (Attachment
D), a number  of AT&T  incentive  arrangements  and  non-qualified  pension  and
benefit  plans are  subject to  non-competition  constraints  that result in the
forfeiture of future amounts, benefits or rights if the Guidelines are violated.
In no event will the Guidelines or any incentive  arrangements or  non-qualified
benefits  as it  applies  to you  require  you to agree to a  prohibition  as to
certain  activities as a condition of receiving (as opposed to the forfeiture if
you  violate  the  Guidelines),  permit  recapture  of any  amounts or  benefits
previously  paid or provided to you or be broader than as currently set forth in
the Guidelines as modified  herein.  This provision shall override any provision
in any plan, program or grant.
<PAGE>
The Guidelines (and any "non-competition clause") shall be modified as follows:

(1)      Section  4  Subpart  2(c)(i)  shall  be  deemed  violated  only  if the
         violation is willful,  with intent to damage,  in a public forum (i.e.,
         lectures,  to the media,  in  published  materials,  to  analysts or in
         comparable forums) and is of a material nature.

(2)      Section 4 Subpart  2(c)(2)  shall only be violated if you,  directly or
         indirectly,  (i)  recruit,  solicit,  induce or attempt  to induce,  or
         encourage others to recruit, solicit or induce, any employee of AT&T or
         an  affiliate of AT&T to terminate  their  employment  with AT&T or any
         affiliate,  to join an entity  with  which you are  affiliated  or (ii)
         offer  employment to any employee of AT&T,  provided that the foregoing
         shall not be violated by the general  advertising  for employees or the
         hiring of employees by entities  with which you are  affiliated so long
         as you are not involved,  either directly or indirectly, in recruiting,
         soliciting,  inducing or attempting to induce, or in encouraging others
         in the  recruiting,  soliciting  or inducing  of, any employee to leave
         AT&T and join any entity with which you are affiliated.

(3)      Section 4 subpart 2(a) shall be modified by deleting  "but shall not be
         limited  to" and it shall not be violated by you owning less than three
         percent (3%) of the debt or equity of a publicly  traded  entity or you
         investing in private  equity funds,  investment  pools or other similar
         vehicles so long as you own less than five  percent  (5%) of the equity
         in the vehicle.

(4)      The  Guidelines  shall not be violated  by any  activity or action more
         than two (2) years after any termination of employment (one (1) year in
         the  case of  "establishing  a  relationship  with"  limitation)  or by
         establishment  of  a  relationship   with  an  entity  that  becomes  a
         "competitor  of the Company"  after you  established  the  relationship
         unless you were hired to assist the entity in becoming a competitor.

(5)      Section 4 Subpart  2(b) shall be  modified  so that it only  applies to
         significant  and direct  competitors  (such as currently  MCI Worldcom,
         Sprint,  any of the regional  Bell  operating  companies and any of the
         major cable companies).

(6)      Notwithstanding   anything  in  the  Guidelines  to  the  contrary,  no
         forfeiture  or  cancellation  shall take place  unless  AT&T shall have
         first given you written  notice of its intent to so forfeit,  or cancel
         or pay out and you have not,  within 30 calendar days of giving of such
         notice to you, ceased such unpermitted  competitive activity,  provided
         that the foregoing  prior notice  procedure  shall not be required with
         respect  to a  competitive  activity  which you  instituted  after AT&T
         informed you in writing  that it believed  such  activity  violated the
         Guidelines.

Indemnification

         The Company  will  indemnify  and hold  harmless to the fullest  extent
permissible by applicable law with regard to any action or inaction of you as an
officer or  director of the Company or any  affiliate  or as a fiduciary  of any
benefit plan of the Company or any affiliate  both during and after your term of
employment.  The  Company  shall cover you under  director or officer  liability
insurance to the same extent it covers other  officers and directors both during
and after the term of employment.
<PAGE>
Dispute Resolution

         At your option or the Company's, any dispute,  controversy, or question
arising under,  out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof shall
be referred for decision by  arbitration in the State of New Jersey by a neutral
arbitrator  selected by the parties hereto.  The proceeding shall be governed by
the Rules of the American  Arbitration  Association then in effect or such rules
last in effect (in the event such Association is no longer in existence). If the
parties are unable to agree upon such a neutral  arbitrator  within  thirty (30)
days  after  either  party has given the other  written  notice of the desire to
submit the dispute,  controversy  or question for  decision as  aforesaid,  then
either  party  may  apply  to  the  American  Arbitration   Association  for  an
appointment  of a  neutral  arbitrator,  or if such  Association  is not then in
existence or does not act in the matter  within 30 days of  application,  either
party may apply to the  Presiding  Judge of the Superior  Court of any county in
New Jersey for an  appointment  of a neutral  arbitrator to hear the parties and
settle the dispute, controversy or question, and such Judge is hereby authorized
to make such appointment.  In the event that either party exercises the right to
submit a dispute arising  hereunder to arbitration,  the decision of the neutral
arbitrator shall be final,  conclusive and binding on all interested persons and
no action at law or  equity  shall be  instituted  or,  if  instituted,  further
prosecuted  by either  party  other  than to  enforce  the award of the  neutral
arbitrator. The award of the neutral arbitrator may be entered in any court that
has jurisdiction.  In the event that you are successful in pursuing any material
claims or disputes  arising out of this Agreement,  the Company shall pay all of
your attorneys' fees and costs reasonably  incurred,  including the compensation
and expenses of any  Arbitrator.  In any other case,  you and the Company  shall
each bear all their own costs and  attorneys  fees,  except the Company shall in
all events pay the costs of any arbitrator appointed hereunder.

Assignment

         This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be binding  upon the
Company and its successors and assigns, provided that the Company may not assign
this Agreement  except in connection with an assignment or disposition of all or
substantially  all of the assets or stock of the Company,  or by law as a result
of a merger or consolidation.  In the event of such assignment, a failure by the
successor to specifically  assume in writing,  delivered to you, the obligations
and  liabilities of the Company  hereunder  shall be deemed a material breach of
this Agreement.

         This  letter  reflects  the entire  agreement  regarding  the terms and
conditions  of  your  employment.  Accordingly,  it  supersedes  and  completely
replaces any prior oral or written communication on this subject. This letter is
not an  employment  contract  and  should not be  construed  or  interpreted  as
containing any guarantee of continued employment. The employment relationship at
AT&T is by mutual consent ("Employment-At-Will").  This means that managers have
the  right  to  terminate  their  employment  at any  time  and for any  reason.
Likewise,  the Company reserves the right to discontinue your employment with or
without cause at any time and for any reason.

         The  incentive  plans as well as the  employee  and  Senior  Management
benefit  plans,  programs  and  practices  as briefly  outlined in this  letter,
reflect  their  current  provisions.  Payments and  benefits  under these plans,
programs,  and practices,  as well as other payments referred to in this letter,
are subject to IRS rules and regulations with respect to withholding, reporting,
and taxation, and will not be grossed-up unless specifically stated. The Company
reserves  the  right to  discontinue  or modify  any such  plans,  programs  and
practices  and to assign any  obligations  under this  agreement  to a successor
company.  Moreover,  the summaries  contained herein are subject to the terms of
such plans, programs and practices.
<PAGE>
         For purposes of the Senior  Management and employee  benefit plans, the
definition of  compensation is as stated in the plans.  Currently,  pensions are
based on base salary and annual  incentives.  Other benefits are based on either
base salary or base salary plus annual  incentives.  All other  compensation and
payments  reflected  in this offer are not  included in the  calculation  of any
employee or Senior Management  benefits (except for the AT&T Incentive  Deferral
Award Plan,  which  currently  permits the  deferral  of Annual  Incentives  and
Performance Shares).

         By  acceptance  of this  offer,  you agree that (1) no trade  secret or
proprietary information belonging to your previous employer will be disclosed or
used by you at  AT&T,  and  that no such  information,  whether  in the  form of
documents,  memoranda,  software,  drawings,  etc.,  will be  retained by you or
brought  with you to AT&T,  and (2) you have  brought  to AT&T's  attention  and
provided it with a copy of any agreement which may impact your future employment
at  AT&T,  including  non-disclosure,   non-competition,   invention  assignment
agreements  or agreements  containing  future work  restrictions.  AT&T will not
require or request  you to do  anything  that would  intentionally  violate  (1)
above.

         Chuck,  I feel the package we have  developed for you is attractive and
anticipates that you will make a critical  contribution to AT&T. We look forward
to having you join us. If you have any questions,  please don't hesitate to call
me or Brad Fusco.

         If you agree with the  foregoing,  and affirm that, to the best of your
knowledge,  there are no agreements or other  impediments that would prevent you
from providing exclusive service to the Company,  please sign this letter in the
space provided below and return the original executed copy to me.

                                   Sincerely,

Mr. Charles Noski

Dear Chuck,

         Pursuant to the terms of your  employment  agreement  dated December 8,
1999, in the event that your 1998-2000 AT&T Seasoned Performance Shares pays out
an amount  less than the target  award of your  previous  employer  for the same
performance  period,  you will be entitled to an additional amount to offset the
difference.  In such event AT&T will  establish  a special  individual  deferred
account  ("Deferred  Account") in your name for such additional  amount, if any.
The  maintenance,  vesting and distribution of this Deferred Account shall be in
accordance  with the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  below  in this  letter
("Agreement").

         As of February  20,  2001,  (hereinafter  the  "Effective  Date"),  the
Company shall credit the Deferred  Account with an initial  balance equal to the
additional amount, if any, as described above.

         Commencing as of the Effective  Date, the Company shall credit interest
to the Deferred  Account,  compounded as of the end of each calendar  quarter at
the rate of the sum of (x)  one-quarter  (1/4) of the average rate applicable to
the 10-year Treasury Note for the prior calendar quarter, plus (y) .50%.

         The Deferred Account will be maintained as a bookkeeping account on the
records of the Company and you will have no present  ownership right or interest
in the Deferred  Account,  or in any assets of the Company with respect thereto.
You shall not have any right to receive any payment with respect to the Deferred
Account,  except as expressly  provided below.  The Deferred  Account may not be
assigned, pledged or otherwise alienated by you and any attempt to do so, or any
garnishment, execution or levy of any kind with respect to the Deferred Account,
will not be recognized.

         The Deferred  Account  shall vest 100%  immediately  upon the effective
date. The vested Deferred Account,  including interest, shall be paid in one (1)
lump  sum  as  soon  as  administratively   feasible  in  the  calendar  quarter
immediately following your retirement/termination date from AT&T.

         In the event of Long Term Disability or your death, prior to receipt of
the Deferred  Account  balance,  the entire amount then credited to the Deferred
Account shall be distributed to you or your named beneficiary (or your estate if
no  beneficiary  has  been  named),  in a lump  sum as soon as  administratively
feasible in the calendar quarter  immediately  following the calendar quarter in
which your death, or Long Term Disability occurs.

           Since the amount  credited  to the  Deferred  Account is  immediately
vested as of the  Effective  Date,  it is subject to FICA taxes at vesting under
current IRS  regulations.  You will be notified of the amount of FICA taxes due.
Payments from the Deferred  Account are subject to payroll tax  withholding  and
reporting,  and  are  in  addition  to and  not in  lieu  of  any  qualified  or
non-qualified pension, savings, or other retirement plan, program or arrangement
covering you.  Amounts  credited to the Deferred Account are not included in the
base for  calculating  benefits under the employee  benefit  plans,  programs or
practices of the Company or its affiliates.
<PAGE>
           The December 8, 1999 employment  agreement,  as amended herein, shall
remain in full force and effect.

         This  Agreement  may not be amended or waived,  unless the amendment or
waiver is in a writing,  signed by you and AT&T's  Executive  Vice  President  -
Human Resources.

         It is agreed and  understood  that you will not  disclose  the specific
terms of this letter or any fact concerning its  negotiation or  implementation,
except in compliance  with legal process,  prior to the  information  being made
public by the  Company.  You may,  however,  discuss the contents of this letter
with your spouse, legal and/or financial counselor and the forfeiture provisions
with any potential future employer.

         The  construction,  interpretation  and  performance  of this Agreement
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey,  without regard to its
conflict of laws rule.

         If you agree with the terms and conditions  detailed above, please sign
in the space provided below and return the executed copy to me.

                                       Sincerely,

                                                           January 16, 2001


Mr. Frank Ianna

Dear Frank:

         In recognition of the role AT&T Corp. (the "Company")  anticipates that
you will play  during the AT&T  restructuring  and  pursuant to the terms of the
Executive  Term  Sheet  signed  by you on  ----------------,  the  Company  will
establish a special  individual  deferred  account  (hereinafter  the  "Deferred
Account") for you. The maintenance,  vesting, forfeiture and distribution of the
Deferred Account shall be in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

         The Company shall credit the Deferred  Account with an initial  balance
of  one  million  dollars  ($1,000,000.00)   retroactive  to  January  1,  2001,
(hereinafter the "Effective  Date").  The Deferred Account will be credited with
an annual  rate of  interest  equal to the annual  rate  applicable  to actively
traded 30-Year Treasury Bonds plus 2%, compounded  quarterly  (one-quarter (1/4)
of the average rate for the prior calendar quarter plus .5%), retroactive to the
Effective Date, and will be calculated in accordance with procedures  determined
by AT&T in its sole and absolute discretion.

         The Deferred Account will be maintained as a bookkeeping account on the
records of the Company and you will have no present  ownership right or interest
in the Deferred Account,  nor in any assets of the Company with respect thereto.
You shall not have any right to receive any payment with respect to the Deferred
Account,  except as expressly  provided below.  The Deferred  Account may not be
assigned, pledged or otherwise alienated by you and any attempt to do so, or any
garnishment, execution or levy of any kind with respect to the Deferred Account,
will not be recognized.

         This  Agreement  may not be amended or waived,  unless the amendment or
waiver is in a writing signed by you and AT&T's Executive Vice President - Human
Resources.

         The Deferred  Account  will vest 50%  (including  interest  thereon) on
December 31, 2001,  and 50% (including  interest  thereon) on December 31, 2002,
contingent upon your continued Company  employment through each vesting date. As
of each vesting date you will be responsible  for  applicable  FICA and Medicare
taxes on the amount vested on such date.

         In the event of your  termination  of  employment  for any reason on or
after December 31, 2002, the entire amount then credited to the Deferred Account
shall be  distributed  to you in a lump sum payment as soon as  administratively
feasible in the calendar quarter  immediately  following the calendar quarter in
which your termination occurs.

         If,  prior to  December  31,  2001,  you resign from the Company or are
terminated for Cause,  as defined below,  the entire amount then credited to the
Deferred Account shall be forfeited.

         If, on or after  December 31, 2001, but prior to December 31, 2002, you
resign from the  Company or are  terminated  for Cause,  as defined  below,  the
unvested  amount  (including  interest  thereon)  then  credited to the Deferred
Account shall be forfeited.  The vested amount (including interest thereon) then
credited  to the  Deferred  Account  shall be  distributed  to you in a lump sum
payment as soon as administratively feasible in the calendar quarter immediately
following the calendar quarter in which your termination occurs.
<PAGE>
         In the event of your  termination of employment from the Company due to
Long Term  Disability  as defined  below,  or your death,  prior to December 31,
2002,  the entire  amount then  credited to the  Deferred  Account  shall become
vested and be distributed to you or your named beneficiary (or your estate if no
beneficiary has been named),  in a lump sum payment as soon as  administratively
feasible in the calendar quarter  immediately  following the calendar quarter in
which your termination of employment occurs.

         In the event of your  resignation for Good Reason (as defined below) or
a Company-initiated termination for other than Cause (as defined below) prior to
December 31, 2002, the entire amount then credited to the Deferred Account shall
become  vested  and be  distributed  to you in a lump  sum  payment  as  soon as
administratively  feasible in the calendar  quarter  immediately  following  the
calendar quarter in which your termination occurs.

         For purposes of this Agreement:

         a)       "Cause" termination shall mean:

                  (i)      your  conviction  (including a plea of guilty or nolo
                           contendere)  of  a  crime  involving  theft,   fraud,
                           dishonesty or moral turpitude;

                  (ii)     violation by you of the Company's  Code of Conduct or
                           Non-Competition Guideline;

                  (iii)    gross omission or gross dereliction of any statutory,
                           common law or other duty of loyalty to the Company or
                           any of its affiliates; or

                  (iv)     repeated  failure  to carry  out the  duties  of your
                           position despite specific instruction to do so.

         b)       "Good Reason" shall mean the  occurrence  without your express
                  written consent of any of the following events:

                  (i)      Your  demotion  to a position  which is not of a rank
                           and  responsibility  comparable  to  members  of  the
                           current    Operations    Group    or   those   of   a
                           similar/replacing governance body; provided, however,
                           that  the  Company's  decision  not  to  continue  an
                           Operations  Group  shall  not  be  Good  Reason,  and
                           provided,  further,  that (1)  changes  in  reporting
                           relationships  shall  not,  alone,   constitute  Good
                           Reason and/or (2) a reduction in your business unit's
                           budget  or a  reduction  your  business  unit's  head
                           count, by themselves,  do not constitute Good Reason;
                           or

                  (ii)     A  reduction  in  your  "Total  Annual  Compensation"
                           (defined as the sum of your Annual Base Salary  Rate,
                           Target Annual  Incentive and "Target Annual Long Term
                           Incentive  Grants")  for any calendar or fiscal year,
                           as  applicable,  to an  amount  that is less than the
                           Total Annual  Compensation  that existed in the prior
                           calendar or fiscal year, as applicable.  For purposes
                           of this  Paragraph  (b)(ii)  the dollar  value of the
                           "Target  Annual  Long Term  Incentive  Grants"  shall
                           exclude the value of any special one-time or periodic
                           long-term  incentive grants,  and shall be determined
<PAGE>

         provide that, as of the date an Eligible Employee terminates employment
         (for  purposes  of these  resolutions,  the  Eligible  Employee's  "CIC
         termination date"):

                  (1)  the Eligible Employee shall be one hundred percent vested

         balance,  the Eligible  Employee  shall be deemed to have completed any
         minimum  period  of net  credited  service  that  is  required  for the
         conversion;
<PAGE>

credit") in an amount equal to the Eligible  Employee's  eligible pay (up to the
applicable limit under Section  401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended  (the  "Code"))  for the  calendar  year  immediately  preceding  the

service as of the last day of the month in which the  Change in Control  occurs,
or (2) one hundred percent;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&TMPP is hereby amended to

determined  in  accordance  with the  Excess  Plan then in effect  that would be
derived only from the portion of his or her cash balance account attributable to
the special excess CIC credit;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&TMPP is hereby amended to
provide  that an  Eligible  Employee  may elect to  receive  his or her  pension
benefit  after  termination  of  employment  under  the  forms of  benefit  then

commencement  date under the applicable pay base formula and shall be calculated
using the immediate  annuity factors  determined in accordance with Code Section

derived from any portion of the Eligible  Employee's  cash balance account shall
equal the greater of the lump sum  determined in accordance  with AT&TMPP (which
is generally  equal to that  portion of his or her cash balance  account) or the
present value of his or her accrued  benefit  payable at normal  retirement  age
<PAGE>

Treasury  regulations with the "stability period" being the plan year containing
the Eligible Employee's pension commencement date and the "lookback month" being
the fifth calendar month preceding the stability period;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&TMPP is hereby amended to

other form of written  agreement with the Company,  such Eligible Employee shall
be entitled to receive,  as determined by the Executive  Vice  President - Human
Resources, in her sole discretion,  prior to a Change in Control, the greater of
(1) the aggregate value of the benefits provided to such Eligible Employee under
the  plans  and  programs  identified  in  Schedule  "A",  as  amended  by these
resolutions,  or (2) the value of the  aggregate  "change  in  control"  benefit
provided  under  his or her  employment,  retention  or  other  form of  written
agreement.  As determined by the Executive Vice President - Human Resources,  in
her sole  discretion,  prior to a  Change  in  Control,  no  provision  of these
resolutions shall duplicate  benefits under any other plan or arrangement of the
Company;

                           RESOLVED:  that the Company shall provide a cash
payment to the Eligible Employee  (following a Change in Control),  in an amount
necessary  to  completely  eliminate  the  adverse  tax  effect on the  Eligible
Employee of any excise  taxes that the  Eligible  Employee  may incur under Code
Section 4999(a) as the recipient of an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Code Section  280G(b)(1)  and Proposed  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.280G-1,
Q&A-3)  and  related  gross-up  payments;  the  amount to be  reimbursed  to the
Eligible  Employee shall be determined by the Company's  independent  accounting
firm  responsible  for  the  Company's  financial   statements  for  the  period
immediately prior to the Change in Control;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Special Executive
Separation  Plan is hereby amended to provide that if an Eligible  Employee is a
participant  (an "EBLIP  Participant")  in the AT&T Corp.  Executive  Basic Life
Insurance  Program  (the  "EBLIP")  and  has  not  attained  his or  her  normal
termination date (as defined in the EBLIP) at the time of his or her termination
of employment from the Company,  the Company shall make a lump sum present value
payment to the EBLIP  Participant (or his or her assignee,  as applicable) equal
<PAGE>
to the sum of (1) the excess (if any) (the "EBLIP Payment") of (a) the estimated
(but not guaranteed) amount (for purposes of these resolutions,  the "EBLIP Paid
Up Policy Amount") of the EBLIP life insurance  policy (the "EBLIP Policy") cash
value that would be sufficient to provide for continuation of insurance coverage
under the EBLIP Policy (based on assumptions  consistent with  assumptions  used
under the EBLIP  immediately  prior to the Change in  Control),  with  projected
coverage equal to the applicable  benefit amount (as defined in the EBLIP) as if
the EBLIP Participant had continued to be an active  management  employee of the
Company until attainment of his or her normal  termination date (assuming annual
base  pay is  fixed  at  his  or her  highest  rate  of  pay as of the  date  of
termination of  employment),  over (b) the cash value of the EBLIP Policy at the
time of transfer to the EBLIP  Participant  or his or her  assignee;  and (2) as
determined by the Company's Executive Vice President - Human Resources, prior to
the  occurrence of a Change in Control,  a tax  adjustment  payment on the EBLIP
Payment consistent with the tax adjustment  provisions of the SMULIP (as defined
below and as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control);

                           RESOLVED:  that the EBLIP is hereby amended to
provide that if an EBLIP Participant who is an Eligible Employee has not reached
his or her normal  termination date (as defined in the EBLIP) at the time of his
or her  termination of  employment,  then  notwithstanding  any provision of the
EBLIP to the  contrary,  the  EBLIP  Policy  shall be  transferred  to the EBLIP
Participant (or his or her assignee,  as applicable) as soon as administratively
possible after the EBLIP  Participant's  employment  termination date; the EBLIP
Policy shall, at the time of transfer,  have a cash value equal to the lesser of
(1) the  amount  of the  cash  value  of the  EBLIP  Policy  at the  time of the
transfer,  or (2) the EBLIP Paid Up Policy  Amount (as described in a resolution
that appears above). If the cash value of the EBLIP Policy  immediately prior to
the time of transfer to the EBLIP Participant or his or her assignee exceeds the
EBLIP Paid Up Policy  Amount,  the Company shall withdraw such excess cash value
before transferring the EBLIP Policy;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Senior Officer Severance
Plan and the AT&T  Senior  Management  Separation  Plan are  hereby  amended  to

Program (the "SMULIP") has not attained his or her normal  termination  date (as
defined in the SMULIP) at the time of his or her  termination of employment from
the  Company,  the Company  shall make a lump sum present  value  payment to the
policyholder (as defined in the SMULIP) for the insurance policy on the Eligible
Employee's life (the "SMULIP Policy") (or the policyholder's  assignee,  if any)
equal to the sum of (1) the excess,  if any,  (the "SMULIP  Payment") of (a) the
estimated (but not guaranteed)  amount (for purposes of these  resolutions,  the
"SMULIP  Paid Up Policy  Amount")  of SMULIP  Policy  cash  value  that would be
sufficient to provide for  continuation  of insurance  coverage under the SMULIP
Policy (based on assumptions  consistent with  assumptions used under the SMULIP
immediately  prior to the Change in Control),  with projected  coverage equal to
the  applicable  benefit  amount (as defined in the SMULIP) that would have been
applicable if the Eligible Employee had continued to be an active senior manager
of the Company until attainment of his or her normal  termination date (assuming
annual  base pay is fixed  at his or her  highest  rate of pay as of the date of
termination of  employment)  over (b) the cash value of the SMULIP Policy on the
Eligible  Employee's  employment  termination  date,  and  (2) a tax  adjustment
payment on the SMULIP Payment (to be determined in an manner consistent with the
tax  adjustment  provisions  of the  SMULIP in effect  immediately  prior to the
Change in Control);
<PAGE>
                           RESOLVED:  that the EBLIP and the SMULIP are each
hereby  amended to provide that the Company will  continue to maintain the EBLIP
and the  SMULIP  in  accordance  with  their  respective  terms  and  conditions

premium  payments to the  applicable  insurance  company),  without any material
reduction in any benefits,  features or plan participant or policyholder  rights
for a minimum of two years after a Change in Control occurs;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Senior Officer Severance
Plan, the AT&T Senior  Management  Separation  Plan, the AT&T Special  Executive
Separation  Plan and the AT&T Separation Plan are each hereby amended to provide
for an Eligible  Employee to receive a reimbursement  for reasonable  legal fees
incurred in any dispute  arising from the  Eligible  Employee's  termination  of
employment  with the Company if a final  decision in connection  with a material
issue of the litigation (or arbitration) involving the termination of employment
is  issued  in the  Eligible  Employee's  favor  by an  arbitrator  or  court of
competent jurisdiction;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Senior Officer Severance
Plan, the AT&T Senior Management Separation Plan, and the AT&T Special Executive
Separation  Plan are each hereby amended to provide for an Eligible  Employee to
receive  a lump sum cash  payment  in an  amount  sufficient,  after  taxes  (as
determined  by the  Company  in its sole  discretion),  to pay for two  years of
financial counseling from a qualified financial counselor;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Senior Management Incentive
Award Deferral Plan  ("Deferral  Plan") shall hereby be amended to provide that,
upon the occurrence of a potential  change in control or a change in control (as
those  terms are  defined  in the AT&T Corp.  Benefits  Protection  Trust),  the
Deferral Plan shall (1) include the individual  deferral agreements made between
the  Company  and the  senior  managers  as  identified  by the  Executive  Vice
President  - Human  Resources,  and (2) cause each of such  individual  deferral
agreements to be treated in a manner consistent with their respective terms;

                           RESOLVED:  that the Deferral Plan is hereby amended
to provide  that the  interest  rate to be applied to an  employee's  (or former
employee's) deferred account balance under the Deferral Plan at any time after a
Change in Control  occurs  shall in no event be less than the rates of  interest
that were being  applied to the  respective  employee's  (or former  employee's)
deferred account balance under the terms of the Deferral Plan (or any individual
deferral  agreements)  immediately  prior to the  occurrence  of such  Change in
Control;

                           RESOLVED:  that the Deferral Plan (including any
individual deferral  agreements) is hereby amended to provide that any non-fully
vested deferred  account balance of any employee (or former  employee) under the
Deferral Plan shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable  immediately upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control;

                           RESOLVED:  that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary  in the  resolutions  of the  Board  adopted  at its  meetings  held on
December 18, 1991 and November 17, 1993, once a determination is made that Trust
Account "A" is fully funded (i.e.,  the "Full Funding  Amount" as defined in the
AT&T Corp. Benefits  Protection Trust ("the "Trust")),  Trust Account "B" of the
Trust  (currently  covering  the  Deferral  Plan,  and for  periods  following a
potential  change in control or a change in control,  as those terms are defined
in the Trust, also covering the individual deferral  agreements) shall be funded
on a systematic  actuarial  basis,  subject to the terms and  conditions  of the
Trust  (including the immediate  funding  obligations upon a potential change in
<PAGE>
control and a change in control). For purposes of this resolution, a "systematic
actuarial  basis" shall be determined as the net present value of benefits under
the Deferral Plan based on active and retired plan  participants'  Deferral Plan
account  balances,  projected  to future  payout  dates in  accordance  with the
payment schedule applicable to each plan participant,  discounted to the date of
the potential change in control or change in control (as those terms are defined
in the Trust)  using the  interest  rate  assumptions  (on an  after-tax  basis)
utilized by the Company under the AT&TMPP as of the date of the potential change
in control or change in control.  For purposes of  projecting  current  Deferral
Plan account  balances to future payout  dates,  a rate or set of rates equal to
the interest crediting rate or rates (in use on the date of the potential change
in control or change in control)  applied to various balances under the Deferral
Plan shall be used.  In cases where a plan  participant's  date of retirement or
termination  or employment was elected as the future initial payout date for one
or more deferral  elections made under the Deferral Plan, the later of age 60 or
the plan  participant's age as of the date of the potential change in control or
change in control shall be used;

                           RESOLVED:  that the terms and conditions of all
outstanding  performance share awards and other stock unit awards under the 1987
Long Term Incentive  Program and the AT&T 1997 Long Term Incentive Program shall
be amended to clarify that provisions  stating that performance awards of shares
shall be  payable  in full and  immediately  settled in the event of a Change in
Control  are not  intended to infer that a pro rata  settlement  be made for the
expired portion of any open performance  period during which a Change in Control
occurs,  but rather are  intended to provide that the payout and  settlement  of
performance  shares for any open performance  periods at the time of a Change in
Control shall be based on the greater of:

          (1) the target number of performance  shares multiplied by the greater
     of (a) the fair market  value of the shares on the grant  date,  or (b) the
     fair market value of the shares at time of the Change in Control, or

          (2) the number or performance  shares based on the performance  factor
     to date  multiplied  by the  greater  of (a) the fair  market  value of the
     shares on the grant  date,  or (b) the fair  market  value of the shares at
     time of the Change in Control;

                           RESOLVED:  that the Executive Vice President - Human

Resources is hereby instructed and empowered to determine the specific terms and
conditions of an amendment to each outstanding performance share award and other
stock unit grant to effect the intent of the preceding resolution.

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Short Term Incentive Plan
(the  "AT&TSTIP")  is hereby  amended to provide that an  employee's  short term
incentive  awards (if any) under the  AT&TSTIP for the  performance  year during
which a Change in Control  occurs  shall be pro rated  through the date on which
the Change in Control occurs and paid out as soon as  administratively  possible
after the  occurrence  of the Change in Control (and the Deferral Plan is hereby
amended to preclude the deferral of any such payment under the Deferral Plan) at
the  greater of (1) the target  award (as defined in the  AT&TSTIP),  or (2) the
current performance factor;

                           RESOLVED:  that AT&T's ancillary retirement-related
benefit plans and programs (as identified in the resolutions  that appear below)
are each hereby amended to provide that, in addition to those  employees who are
otherwise  eligible to participate in the plans, based on the plans' eligibility
criteria, an Eligible Employee of a Participating Company (for purposes of these
<PAGE>
resolutions,  a  "Participating  Company" is AT&T Corp.  and any  subsidiary  or
affiliated  company  of AT&T Corp.  that is a  participating  company  under the
applicable  terms of the  respective  plan  immediately  prior to the  Change in
Control) shall be eligible to  participate in those plans and programs  (subject

          (1) the sum of the Eligible  Employee's  age and net credited  service
     (both  expressed  in  days)  determined  as  of  the  Eligible   Employee's
     termination  date is no less than 23,725 days (which  equals the product of
     65 years and 365 days per year),

          (2) the  Eligible  Employee  has at least five  years of net  credited
     service as of the Eligible Employee's termination date, and

          (3) with respect to eligibility for Company-paid postretirement health
     benefits under the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for Retired  Employees and the
     AT&T  Dental  Expense  Plan for  Retired  Employees,  and  eligibility  for
     postretirement  life insurance benefits under the AT&T Group Life Insurance
     Plan,   the  Eligible   Employee  (a)  was  on  the  active  payroll  of  a

     and  (b)  had  five  or  more  years  of  net  credited  service  with  any
     Participating Company as of December 31, 1999;

                           RESOLVED:  that, for purposes of the CIC Rule of 65
(as stated in the preceding  resolution),  an Eligible  Employee's  net credited
service shall be as determined  in accordance  with the terms and  conditions of
AT&T's  ancillary  retirement-related  benefit  plans  and  programs,  provided,
however,  that net credited service shall not include any service resulting from
a transition leave of absence;

                           RESOLVED:  that the CIC Rule of 65 (as stated in a
resolution  that appears above) shall apply to the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for
Retired Employees,  the AT&T Dental Expense Plan for Retired Employees, the AT&T
Group Life  Insurance  Plan  (subject  to the  existing  maximum  limitation  on
benefits for employees  terminating  employment  after December 31, 2000),  and,
upon the approval of the  Executive  Vice  President - Human  Resources,  may be
extended,  in her  sole  discretion,  prior  to a Change  in  Control,  to other
applicable  ancillary  retirement-related  benefit  plans  and  programs  of the
Company;

                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for
Management Employees and the AT&T Dental Expense Plan for Active Employees,  are
each hereby amended to provide that (1) the Company shall pay the full amount of
an Eligible  Employee's premium payments for the cost of continuation of medical
coverage or dental  coverage under the AT&T Medical  Expense Plan for Management
Employees or the AT&T Dental  Expense Plan for Active  Employees,  respectively,
for the  Eligible  Employee,  his or her lawful  spouse,  and  eligible  Class I
dependents  (provided  that the lawful  spouse  and/or Class I  dependents  were
covered under the respective plan immediately  prior to the Eligible  Employee's
termination of employment) for a period of up to eighteen  months  following the
end of the month during which the Eligible Employee's  termination of employment
occurs,   and  (2)  such   Company-paid   continuation  of  coverage  shall  run
concurrently with any rights to continuation of coverage the Eligible  Employee,
his or her lawful  spouse,  and eligible  Class I dependents  may otherwise have
under the portions of the AT&T Medical Expense Plan for Management Employees and
the AT&T Dental Expense Plan for Active  Employees that implement the applicable
provisions  of the  Consolidated  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1985
("COBRA");
<PAGE>
                           RESOLVED:  that the AT&T Group Life Insurance Plan
is hereby  amended to provide  that if an Eligible  Employee is not eligible for
postretirement life insurance benefits under the AT&T Group Life Insurance Plan,
as  amended to  include  the CIC Rule of 65, the amount of basic life  insurance
coverage for such Eligible  Employee in effect  immediately  prior to his or her
termination of employment shall be continued,  at Company expense,  for a period
of twelve months after the Eligible Employee's termination date;

                           RESOLVED:  that, unless required by applicable law,
each of the above-referenced employee benefit plans, programs and perquisites of
the Company are each hereby  amended to provide  that upon the  occurrence  of a
Change in Control, no amendment may be made by the Board, the Company (including
any successor to the Company),  any committee,  any officer, any employee of the
Company or any other  party to  suspend,  modify,  or  eliminate  the  severance
provisions and the severance-related benefit provisions that are applicable upon
the occurrence of a Change in Control;

                          RESOLVED:        that, the foregoing amendments to the
above-referenced  plans,  programs  and  perquisites  shall be  subject  to such
changes,  including  retroactive  changes, as may be necessary to conform to the
above  resolutions and, when  applicable,  to obtain an Internal Revenue Service
(IRS)  determination  that such plans are qualified and their associated  trusts
tax exempt (the "Qualified Plans"), under the Code and such other changes as may
be necessary to comply with applicable law; however,  if the IRS determines that
one or more of the Qualified Plans are not qualified and exempt by reason of any
such amendment, then such amendment shall be of no force and effect;

As  discussed in note 1 to the  aforementioned  combined  financial  statements,
effective  March 9, 1999,  AT&T Corp.,  the owner of the assets  comprising  New
Liberty, acquired Tele-Communications,  Inc., the owner of the assets comprising
Old Liberty, in a business combination  accounted for as a purchase. As a result
of the acquisition, the combined financial information for the periods after the
acquisition  is  presented  on a different  cost basis than that for the periods
before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable.

                         AT&T WIRELESS GROUP FINANCIALS

                        (an integrated business of AT&T)

          AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated  business of AT&T Corp. and not a
      stand-alone  entity.  As AT&T Wireless  Group is a tracking stock of AT&T,
      separate  financial  statements  are  not  required  to be  filed.  We are
      providing these financial statements to provide additional  disclosures to
      investors  to allow  them to  assess  the  financial  performance  of AT&T
      Wireless Group. Presenting separate financial statements for AT&T Wireless
      Group  does not  indicate  that we have  changed  title to any  assets  or
      responsibility  for any  liabilities,  and does not  purport to affect the
      rights of any of AT&T's creditors. Holders of AT&T Wireless Group tracking
      stock do not have  claims  against  the  assets  of AT&T  Wireless  Group.
      instead,  AT&T Wireless  Group  shareholders  own a separate class of AT&T
      common  stock that is intended to reflect the  financial  performance  and
      economic value of AT&T's wireless services' businesses.

                          Report of Independent Accountants

      To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of AT&T Corp.:

          In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  combined  balance  sheets and the
      related  combined   statements  of  operations  and  changes  in  combined
      attributed  net assets and of cash flows present  fairly,  in all material
      respects,  the financial  position of AT&T Wireless  Group at December 31,
      2000 and 1999,  and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows
      for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2000,  in
      conformity with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
      States of America.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility of
      AT&T Wireless  Group's  management;  our  responsibility  is to express an
      opinion on these financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted
      our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards
      generally accepted in the United States of America,  which require that we
      plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether
      the  financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An audit
      includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and
      disclosures  in  the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting
      principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,   and
      evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that
      our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          AT&T Wireless Group is a fully integrated business unit of AT&T Corp.;
      consequently,  as indicated in Note 1, these combined financial statements
      have  been  derived  from  the  consolidated   financial   statements  and
      accounting  records of AT&T Corp.  and  reflect  certain  assumptions  and
      allocations.  Moreover, as indicated in Note 1, AT&T Wireless Group relies
      on AT&T Corp.  for  administrative,  management  and other  services.  The
      financial position,  results of operations and cash flows of AT&T Wireless
      Group could differ from those that would have  resulted had AT&T  Wireless
      Group operated  autonomously or as an entity  independent of AT&T Corp. As
      more fully discussed in Note 1, the combined financial  statements of AT&T
      Wireless Group should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
      financial statements of AT&T Corp.

      Background

          AT&T  Wireless  Group is an  integrated  business of AT&T and is not a
      separate  legal entity.  On April 27, 2000,  AT&T completed an offering of
      15.6%, or 360 million shares,  of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an
      offering price of $29.50 per share.  AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock is
      a class of AT&T common  stock,  which is intended to provide  holders with
      financial returns based on the financial performance and economic value of
      AT&T's wireless services'  businesses.  AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
      issued in the offering  reflected only a portion of the authorized shares.
      The remaining 84.4% has been reserved for the benefit of AT&T Common Stock
      Group  (which  consists  of  the  operations  of  AT&T  other  than  those
      attributed  to AT&T  tracking  stocks) and is intended to be  reflected in
      AT&T common stock.

          On  October  25,  2000,  AT&T  announced  its  decision  to present an
      exchange  offer to AT&T common  shareowners  to allow them to exchange any
      portion of shares of AT&T common stock for shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group
      tracking stock. On December 22, 2000, AT&T filed a registration  statement
      for the exchange offer with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  which
      was amended on February 23, 2001. AT&T anticipates that the exchange offer
      will be completed  during the second quarter of 2001.  AT&T Wireless Group
      will  continue  to be a part  of  AT&T  following  the  completion  of the
      exchange offer.

          Also on October 25, 2000,  AT&T announced its  restructuring  plan. In
      connection with its  restructuring  plan,  following the completion of the
      exchange  offer  and  subject  to  certain  conditions,  AT&T  intends  to
      split-off  AT&T Wireless  Group from AT&T.  These  conditions  include the
      receipt of a favorable  ruling on the split-off from the Internal  Revenue
      Service (IRS) and  satisfaction of conditions  contained in AT&T's new $25
      billion credit agreement, including the repayment of AT&T Wireless Group's
      intercompany  obligations to AT&T. The split-off,  which is anticipated to
      be completed in mid-2001, would include several steps. These steps include
      transferring  substantially  all of the  assets  and  liabilities  of AT&T
      Wireless Group to AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., mandatorily exchanging all
      issued and  outstanding  shares of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,
      including those issued in the exchange offer,  for shares of AT&T Wireless
      Services common stock,  and  distributing a majority of the shares of AT&T
      Wireless Services common stock held by AT&T Common Stock Group, to holders
      of AT&T common  stock on a pro rata  basis.  On February  14,  2001,  AT&T
      announced  its  intention  to  retain up to $3  billion  of shares of AT&T
      Wireless  Services  for its own account  for sale or  exchange  within six
      months of the split-off, subject to receipt of a satisfactory IRS ruling.

          In  January   2001,   NTT   DoCoMo,   a  leading   Japanese   wireless
      communications company,  invested $9.8 billion in a security of AT&T that,
      like AT&T Wireless Group tracking  stock, is intended to reflect a portion
      of the financial  performance  and economic value of AT&T Wireless  Group.
      AT&T Wireless Group,  through AT&T Wireless Group, LLC, was allocated $6.2
      billion of the proceeds  from  DoCoMo's  $9.8 billion  investment in AT&T.
<PAGE>
          AT&T  retained  the remaining  $3.6  billion of the DoCoMo  investment
      proceeds as consideration  for the reduction in AT&T's retained portion of
      AT&T Wireless Group's value. Following the split-off, this investment will
      be converted  into  approximately  16% of AT&T Wireless  Services'  common
      shares. DoCoMo also received warrants at an exercise price of $35 per AT&T
      Wireless  Group  tracking  share   equivalent   that  would  represent  an
      approximate additional 1.6% of AT&T Wireless Services' common shares after
      the split-off.  As part of this investment,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through
      AT&T Wireless  Services,  Inc., has entered into a strategic alliance with
      DoCoMo  to  develop  mobile  multimedia  services  on  a  global-standard,
      high-speed  wireless  network.  DoCoMo may require the  repurchase  of its
      investment at DoCoMo's  original  purchase price,  plus interest,  if AT&T
      does not complete the split-off by specified  dates  beginning  January 1,
      2002,  or if AT&T  Wireless  Group fails to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.

      Basis of Presentation

          AT&T Wireless Group is an integrated  business of AT&T.  AT&T Wireless
      Group includes the results of its mobility and fixed wireless  businesses,
      as well as its  international  operations,  which  primarily  include  the
      earnings or losses  associated  with  equity  interests  in  international
      wireless communications ventures and partnerships.  The combined financial
      statements reflect the results of operations,  financial position, changes
      in combined attributed net assets and cash flows of AT&T Wireless Group as
      if it were a separate  entity for all  periods  presented.  The  financial
      information  included  herein may not  necessarily  reflect  the  combined
      results  of  operations,  financial  position,  changes in equity and cash
      flows of AT&T Wireless  Group had it been a separate,  stand-alone  entity
      during the periods presented.  The combined  financial  statements of AT&T
      Wireless Group should be read in conjunction with AT&T's Form 10-K for the
      year ended December 31, 2000.

          The combined  financial  statements of AT&T Wireless  Group conform to
      generally   accepted   accounting   principles.   The  combined  financial
      statements reflect the assets, liabilities,  revenue and expenses directly
      attributable  to  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  as well  as  allocations  deemed
      reasonable by management, to present the results of operations,  financial
      position and cash flows of AT&T Wireless Group on a stand-alone basis. The
      allocation  methodologies  have  been  described  within  the notes to the
      combined financial statements where appropriate.

          The combined  financial  statements of AT&T Wireless  Group  primarily
      include the legal entity results of AT&T Wireless  Services,  Inc. and its
      subsidiaries (AWS), AT&T Wireless Group, LLC (AWG), AT&T Wireless PCS, LLC
      and its  subsidiaries  (AWPCS),  and Winston,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries
      (Winston),  all of which were direct  subsidiaries  of AT&T  Corp.,  as of
      December 31, 2000.  In February  2001,  the legal  entities of Winston and
      AWPCS as well as  certain  assets  of AWG  were  transferred  to AWS.  The
      remaining  assets and liabilities of AWG will be transferred  prior to the
      split-off.

          The April 2000 offering of AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted
      in net  proceeds  to AT&T,  after  deducting  underwriter's  discount  and
      related fees and expenses,  of $10.3 billion. AT&T attributed $7.0 billion
      of the  net  proceeds  to  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  in the  form  of a note
      receivable,  which was repaid by  December  31,  2000,  primarily  to fund
      acquisitions and capital expenditures. Interest on the note receivable was
      calculated  based upon the average  daily  balance  outstanding  at a rate
      equal to the one month London  InterBank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR)  minus six
      basis  points,  a rate intended to be equivalent to the rate AT&T Wireless
      Group would receive if it were a stand-alone entity.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                      (In Millions Unless Otherwise Noted)

      1. Background and Basis of Presentation (Continued)

          Prior to the  offering of  AT&T wireless  group  tracking  stock,  the
      capital  structure  of AT&T  Wireless  Group had been  assumed  based upon
      AT&T's historical capital ratio adjusted for certain items. In determining
      the allocation  between short- and long-term debt and preferred  stock, we
      considered  factors such as  prospective  financing  requirements  for the
      business,  working capital commitments and future  requirements,  and peer
      group  analysis.  This  resulted in $3.4 billion in long-term  debt due to
      AT&T at December 31, 1999,  paying annual  interest at 7.25%. In addition,
      as of December 31, 1999,  AT&T Wireless Group had issued and  outstanding,
      $1.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred stock held by AT&T that,  subject
      to the  approval  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  capital  stock  committee,  is
      redeemable at the option of AT&T. The preferred  stock is included  within
      "Combined  attributed  net assets" on the  accompanying  combined  balance
      sheets.  On May 1, 2000,  following  the offering of AT&T  Wireless  Group
      tracking  stock,  $2.0  billion  of  AT&T  Wireless  Group's   outstanding
      long-term debt to AT&T was  recapitalized  into an additional $2.0 billion
      of 9% cumulative  preferred stock issued to AT&T. In conjunction  with the
      recapitalization, the remaining long-term debt due to AT&T of $1.8 billion
      was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a fixed
      rate of 8.1% per annum.  The interest rate is intended to be substantially
      equivalent to the interest rate that AT&T Wireless  Group would be able to
      obtain  from  third   parties,   including  the  public   markets,   as  a
      non-affiliate of AT&T without the benefit of any guaranty by AT&T.

          During  December 2000, AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWS,  obtained a
      short-term revolving loan from AT&T, which is included in "Short-term debt
      due to AT&T" in the accompanying  combined balance sheets. At December 31,
      2000,  the amount  outstanding  under the loan was $638,  paying  interest
      monthly at the average seven-day commercial paper rate, which was 8.37% at
      December 31, 2000.  The revolving  loan matures on December 29, 2001.  The
      loan was repaid in full in January 2001.

          Changes  in  combined  attributed  net  assets  prior to the  offering
      primarily  represented net transfers to or from AT&T,  after giving effect
      to the net income or loss of AT&T  Wireless  Group during the period,  and
      were  assumed to be  settled in cash.  AT&T's  capital  contributions  for
      purchase business  combinations and initial  investments in joint ventures
      and  partnerships  which AT&T  attributed to AT&T Wireless Group have been
      treated as noncash transactions prior to the offering.

          AT&T performs cash management functions on behalf of the AT&T Wireless
      Group.  Substantially  all of the AT&T Wireless  Group's cash balances are
      swept to AT&T on a daily  basis,  where they are managed  and  invested by
      AT&T.  Prior to the offering of the AT&T Wireless  Group  tracking  stock,
      transfers  of cash to and from  AT&T  were  reflected  as a  component  of
      combined  attributed  net  assets,  with no  interest  income  or  expense
      reflected. Subsequent to the offering, transfers were reflected as changes
      in the note  receivable  from or  short-term  debt  payable to AT&T.  Cash
      balances  maintained  and reported by the AT&T  Wireless  Group  primarily
      represent cash balances for which no right of offset exists with AT&T.

                      (In Millions Unless Otherwise Noted)

      1. Background and Basis of Presentation (Continued)

          General  corporate  overhead related to AT&T's corporate  headquarters
      and common support  divisions has been allocated to AT&T Wireless Group as
      it was not deemed  practicable to specifically  identify such common costs
      to AT&T Wireless Group.  These allocations were based on the ratio of AT&T
      Wireless  Group's  external  costs and  expenses  to  AT&T's  consolidated
      external costs and expenses, adjusted for any functions that AT&T Wireless
      Group performs on its own. However, the costs of these services charged to
      AT&T Wireless Group are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would
      have been incurred if AT&T Wireless  Group had performed  these  functions
      entirely as a stand-alone  entity,  nor are they  indicative of costs that
      will be charged or incurred in the future.

          Consolidated  income tax provision,  related tax payments or  refunds,
      and  deferred tax  balances of AT&T have been  allocated to AT&T  Wireless
      Group based  principally  on the taxable  income and tax credits  directly
      attributable  to AT&T  Wireless  Group.  These  allocations  reflect  AT&T
      Wireless Group's  contribution to AT&T's  consolidated  taxable income and
      the consolidated  tax liability and tax credit  position.  The AT&T Common
      Stock  Group and AT&T  Wireless  Group  have  entered  into a tax  sharing
      agreement that provides for tax sharing payments based on the taxes or tax
      benefits of a  hypothetical  affiliated  group  consisting  of AT&T Common
      Stock  Group  and  AT&T  Wireless  Group.  Based  on this  agreement,  the
      consolidated tax liability before credits is allocated between the groups,
      based on each group's  contribution to consolidated  taxable income of the
      hypothetical  group.  For  purposes of the tax sharing  agreement,  the 9%
      cumulative  preferred  stock  held  by AT&T  is  treated  as if it were an
      intercompany  debt instrument and,  accordingly,  tax sharing payments are
      calculated by treating  coupon payments on the preferred stock as interest
      expense to AT&T  Wireless  Group and interest  income to AT&T Common Stock
      Group.  Consolidated tax credits of the  hypothetical  group are allocated
      between groups based on each group's contribution to each tax credit.

      2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash Equivalents

          All highly liquid  investments  with original  maturities of generally
      three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

      Cash Flows

          For  purposes  of  the  combined   statements   of  cash  flows,   all
      transactions  between AT&T  Wireless  Group and AT&T,  except for purchase
      business  combinations  and  initial  investments  in joint  ventures  and
      partnerships  which were  funded by AT&T and  contributed  by AT&T to AT&T
      Wireless  Group prior to the offering,  have been  accounted for as having
      been  settled in cash at the time the  transaction  was  recorded  by AT&T
      Wireless Group.

      Inventories

          Inventories,  which consist  principally of handsets and  accessories,
      are  recorded  at the  lower  of  cost  or  market.  Cost  is  principally
      determined by the first-in,  first-out (FIFO) method. Market is determined
      using replacement cost.

      Property, Plant and Equipment

          Property,  plant and equipment are recorded at cost,  unless impaired,
      and  depreciation is determined  based upon the assets'  estimated  useful
      lives.  Depreciation is calculated on a  straight-line  basis according to
      the following useful lives:

          Wireless communications systems and other equipment         3-15 years
          Building and improvements                                   5-20 years

          When  AT&T  Wireless  Group sells,  disposes  or retires  assets,  the
      related  gains or losses are included in operating  results.

          During 1998,  AT&T Wireless Group completed  a review of the estimated
      service lives of certain wireless  communications  equipment. As a result,
      effective  January 1, 1998, the estimated  service lives of such equipment
      were changed from 12 years to varying periods ranging primarily from seven
      to ten years, with certain assets being changed to 15 years,  depending on
      the  nature of the  equipment.  The net  impact of these  changes  to 1998
      results was an annual  increase in depreciation  expense of  approximately
      $42 and an annual reduction in net income of  approximately  $26. See Note
      14  for  further  discussion  associated  with  an  additional  change  in
      depreciable lives.

      Software Capitalization

          AT&T Wireless  Group  capitalizes  certain  direct  development  costs
      associated with internal-use software,  including external direct costs of
      materials and services,  and payroll costs for employees  devoting time to
      the software  projects.  These costs are included  within other assets and
      are amortized  over a period not to exceed five years  beginning  when the
      asset  is   substantially   ready  for  use.  Costs  incurred  during  the
      preliminary  project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are
      expensed  as  incurred.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  also  capitalizes  initial
      operating-system  software  costs and amortizes  them over the life of the
      associated hardware.

          AT&T  Wireless  Group  also  capitalizes  costs  associated  with  the
      development of application  software incurred from the time  technological
      feasibility is established  until the software is ready to provide service
      to customers.  These capitalized costs are included in property, plant and
      equipment and are amortized over a useful life not to exceed five years.

      Licensing Costs

          Licensing  costs are  primarily  incurred  to  acquire  cellular  (850
      megahertz) and PCS (1900 megahertz) licenses. In addition, licensing costs
      include costs incurred to acquire 38 gigahertz and 2.3 gigahertz licenses.
      Amortization  begins with the  commencement of service to customers and is
      computed using the straight-line method over periods of 35 or 40 years.

      2.  Summary  of  Significant   Accounting  Policies  (Continued)

      Capitalized Interest

          AT&T Wireless  Group  capitalizes  interest which is applicable to the
      construction  of additions  to  property,  plant,  and  equipment  and the
      acquisitions  of licenses until the assets are placed into service.  These
      costs are amortized over the related assets' estimated useful lives.

      Investments

          Investments  in which AT&T Wireless  Group,  primarily held by AWS and
      AWPCS,  exercises significant influence but which AT&T Wireless Group does
      not control are  accounted for under the equity  method.  Under the equity
      method,  investments  are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for AT&T
      Wireless  Group's  subsequent  contributions  and its share of earnings or
      losses, and distributions.  The excess of the carrying value of investment
      over the  underlying  book  value of the  investee's  net  assets is being
      amortized over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years.

            Investments   in  which  AT&T  Wireless  Group  has  no  significant
      influence  over the  investee  are  accounted  for under the cost  method.
      Investments  covered under the scope of Statement of Financial  Accounting
      Standards (SFAS) No. 115,  "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
      Equity Securities," are classified as "available for sale" and are carried
      at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, are included within
      combined attributed net assets as "Net revaluation of investments".

      Goodwill

          Goodwill  is the excess of the  purchase  price over the fair value of
      net assets acquired in business combinations  accounted for as a purchase.
      Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods not exceeding
      40 years.

      Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

          Long-lived  assets such as property,  plant and  equipment,  licensing
      costs,  goodwill,  investments and  capitalized  software are reviewed for
      impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the
      carrying  amount may not be  recoverable.  It is reasonably  possible that
      these assets could become impaired as a result of  technological  or other
      industry changes.  For assets AT&T Wireless Group intends to hold for use,
      if the total of the expected future  undiscounted  cash flows is less than
      the carrying  amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference
      between the fair value and  carrying  value of the asset.  For assets AT&T
      Wireless  Group intends to dispose of, a loss is recognized for the amount
      that the  estimated  fair  value,  less  costs to sell,  is less  than the
      carrying value of the assets.  In addition,  in accordance with Accounting
      Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible  Assets", AT&T Wireless Group
      continues to evaluate the amortization periods to determine whether events
      or circumstances warrant revised amortization periods. Additionally,  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  periodically  evaluates  the useful lives of its wireless
      communications   systems   and  other   equipment   based  on  changes  in
      technological and industry conditions.

      2.  Summary  of  Significant   Accounting  Policies  (Continued)

      Revenue Recognition

          Wireless  services revenue is recognized based upon minutes of traffic
      processed and contracted  fees.  Customer  activation fees, along with the
      related costs,  are deferred and amortized over the customer  relationship
      period.  The  revenue  and related  expenses  associated  with the sale of
      wireless  handsets and  accessories  are recognized  when the products are
      delivered  and accepted by the  customer,  as this is  considered  to be a
      separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services. During 2000,
      we adopted  Securities and Exchange  Commission Staff Accounting  Bulletin
      No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements".  The adoption did
      not have a material  impact on our  results  of  operations  or  financial
      condition.

      Advertising and Promotional Costs

          Costs  of  advertising   and  promotions  are  expensed  as  incurred.
      Advertising and promotional  expenses were $618,  $386, and $344, in 2000,
      1999 and 1998, respectively.

      Income Taxes

         AT&T Wireless  Group is not a separate  taxable  entity for federal and
      state income tax purposes  and its results of  operations  are included in
      the  consolidated  federal  and state  income tax  returns of AT&T and its
      affiliates. AT&T Wireless Group's provision or benefit for income taxes is
      based upon its  contribution  to the overall  income tax liability of AT&T
      and its affiliates as described in Note 1.

      Issuance of Common Stock By Affiliates

          Changes in AT&T Wireless Group's proportionate share of the underlying
      equity of a subsidiary  or equity method  investee,  which result from the
      issuance of additional equity securities by such entity, are recognized as
      increases or decreases in combined attributed net assets.

      Use of Estimates

          The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally
      accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the
      financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the period reported.
      Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Estimates are used when
      accounting for certain items such as the allowance for doubtful  accounts,
      depreciation and amortization,  taxes,  valuation of investments and asset
      impairment and restructuring charges.

      Reclassifications

          Certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior  year  amounts  to
      conform with current year presentations.

      Concentrations

          AT&T Wireless  Group  purchases a substantial  portion of its wireless
      infrastructure  equipment from three major suppliers.  Additionally,  four
      primary  vendors  provide AT&T Wireless  Group's  multi-network  handsets.
      Further, AT&T Wireless Group relies on one vendor to provide substantially
      all  of its  billing  services.  Loss  of any  of  these  suppliers  could
      adversely  impact  operations  temporarily  until a comparable  substitute
      could be found.  AT&T  Wireless  Group  does not have a  concentration  of
      available sources of labor or services,  nor does AT&T Wireless Group have
      any  significant  concentration  of business  transacted with a particular
      customer, that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact operations.

      3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

          In September  2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
      issued SFAS No. 140,  "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
      Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities--A Replacement of FASB No. 125".
      This statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
      and  servicing of financial  assets and  extinguishments  of  liabilities.
      Under these  standards,  after a transfer of financial  assets,  an entity
      recognizes  the  financial  and  servicing  assets  it  controls  and  the
      liabilities it has incurred,  derecognizes  financial  assets when control
      has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. This
      statement provides  consistent  standards for distinguishing  transfers of
      financial   assets  that  are  sales  from   transfers  that  are  secured
      borrowings.  This  statement is effective  for  transfers and servicing of
      financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring after March
      31, 2001.  AT&T  Wireless  Group does not expect that the adoption of SFAS
      No.  140  will  have a  material  impact  on its  results  of  operations,
      financial position or cash flows.

          In  June  1998,  the   FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  133,  "Accounting  for
      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". Among other provisions, it
      requires  that  entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either assets or
      liabilities  in the  statement  of financial  position  and measure  those
      instruments at fair value.  Gains and losses resulting from changes in the
      fair values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the
      use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge  accounting.  The
      effective  date of this  standard was delayed via the issuance of SFAS No.
      137. The effective date for SFAS No. 133 is now for fiscal years beginning
      after June 15, 2000, though earlier adoption is encouraged and retroactive
      application is prohibited.  For AT&T Wireless  Group,  this means that the
      standard must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001. In June 2000,  the
      FASB issued SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain Derivative  Instruments
      and Certain  Hedging  Activities"  as an amendment  to SFAS No. 133.  This
      statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
      issues  under SFAS No. 133 on specific  types of hedges.  The  adoption of
      SFAS No. 133 in January 2001,  did not have a material  impact to the AT&T
      Wireless Group's results of operations,  financial position or cash flows.
      In  addition,  based on the types of contracts  we  currently  have,  AT&T
      Wireless Group does not anticipate that this standard will have a material
      impact on future results of AT&T Wireless Group.

      4. Acquisitions and Dispositions

          During 2000, 1999 and 1998,  AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWS, AWPCS
      and  Winston,  completed  certain  transactions  as  part  of its  overall
      strategy to expand its wireless  footprint  and divest  itself of non core
      interests.  The net pretax  gains  recognized  were $362,  $99 and $600 in
      2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The pretax gains and losses from the
      sale and  exchange  transactions  are  included  in "Other  income" in the
      accompanying   combined  statements  of  operations.   A  summary  of  the
      significant transactions follows.

          In November  1998,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through AWS, and BellSouth
      combined their jointly owned cellular  properties in Los Angeles,  Houston
      and  Galveston,  Texas,  plus cash, to form AB Cellular  Holding,  LLC (AB
      Cellular),  which owned,  controlled and supervised all three  properties.
      AT&T Wireless Group held a 55.62% equity interest in AB Cellular, however,
      held a 50% voting interest,  therefore,  this investment was accounted for
      under the equity  method.  Pursuant to the AB Cellular  Limited  Liability
      Company   Agreement,   there  were  redemption   provisions  that  allowed
      BellSouth,  commencing in December 2000, to alter the ownership  structure
      of AB  Cellular  pursuant  to one of three  options.  On December 4, 2000,
      BellSouth  announced its election to have AB Cellular  exercise its option
      to redeem AT&T Wireless  Group's 55.62% equity  interest.  On December 29,
      2000, AB Cellular completed the redemption of AT&T Wireless Group's 55.62%
      equity  interest in AB Cellular,  and in exchange,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,
      through AWS,  received 100% of the net assets of the Los Angeles  cellular
      property.  As a  result  of  the  redemption,  AB  Cellular  recognized  a
      significant  gain on the transaction  based on the estimated fair value of
      the net  assets  of the  Los  Angeles  cellular  property  on the  date of
      redemption.  AT&T Wireless  Group's net equity earnings for the year ended
      December 31, 2000, included $372 reflecting its proportionate share of the
      gain. The net assets of the Los Angeles cellular property were recorded at
      fair value and resulted in a pretax loss of $184 to AT&T  Wireless  Group.
      The excess of the fair value of the Los Angeles cellular property over the
      fair  value  of net  tangible  assets  received,  based  on a  preliminary
      allocation,  totaled  $3,174 and has been  assigned  to  licensing  costs,
      goodwill and other  intangible  assets and is being amortized over periods
      of five to 40 years. We may make refinements to the allocation of the fair
      value of assets  acquired  in future  periods  as the  related  fair value
      appraisals of certain assets and liabilities are finalized. As a result of
      this  transaction,  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  include  a  non-cash
      reduction to investments of $3,756,  associated with the redemption of its
      equity interest in AB Cellular.

          On  November 13, 2000,  TeleCorp PCS, Inc.  (Telecorp)  completed  its
      merger  agreement  with  Tritel,  Inc.,  as part  of a stock  transaction.
      Pursuant  to the  terms  of the  agreement,  each  company  merged  with a
      separate newly formed  subsidiary of a new holding  company named TeleCorp
      PCS, Inc., upon consummation of the transaction. Prior to the merger, AT&T
      Wireless Group,  through AWPCS,  held equity interests in each of TeleCorp
      and  Tritel  which  were  both  affiliates  of  AT&T  Wireless  Group.  In
      connection  with the merger,  AT&T Wireless Group  contributed to TeleCorp
      PCS, Inc., rights to acquire wireless licenses in Wisconsin and Iowa, paid
      approximately  $20 in cash  and  extended  the term of its  brand  license
      agreement  through July 2005,  in exchange for  approximately  9.3 million

      additional common shares in the newly combined  company.  This transaction
      brought AT&T  Wireless  Group's  equity  stake in the combined  company to
      approximately  23%,  assuming the conversion of all currently  convertible
      preferred stock to common stock. In a separate  transaction with TeleCorp,
      AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWPCS,  completed  an exchange of certain
      wireless  licenses  and  rights  to  acquire  additional  licenses  in the
      Wisconsin  and  Iowa   markets,   as  well  as  made  a  cash  payment  of
      approximately $80. In return,  AT&T Wireless Group received TeleCorp's PCS
      licenses  and  wireless  systems  in  several  New  England  markets.  The
      acquisition   of  the  wireless   systems  was  recorded  as  a  purchase.
      Accordingly,  the operating results have been included in the accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of
      aggregate  fair value of total assets  acquired over the fair value of net
      tangible assets acquired, based on a preliminary allocation,  totaled $268
      and has been assigned to licensing  costs,  goodwill and other  intangible
      assets  and is being  amortized  over  periods  of five to 40 years.  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  recognized  a pretax gain of $379  associated  with these
      transactions.

          On October 2, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWPCS,  completed its
      acquisition of a wireless system in Indianapolis for approximately $530 in
      cash.  The  transaction  was  recorded  as a  purchase.  Accordingly,  the
      operating  results of Indianapolis  have been included in the accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of
      aggregate  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of net  tangible  assets
      acquired,  based on a  preliminary  allocation,  totaled $494 and has been
      assigned to licensing costs,  goodwill and other intangible  assets and is
      being amortized over periods of five to 40 years. We may make  refinements
      to the allocations of the purchase prices in future periods as the related
      fair value appraisals of certain assets and liabilities are finalized.

          On June 19, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group  announced  that it had signed
      definitive agreements to acquire wireless systems in the San Francisco Bay
      Area, San Diego and Houston.  On December 29, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group,
      through AWS and AWPCS, completed the acquisition of the wireless system in
      Houston for  approximately  $1.0 billion in cash.  On September  29, 2000,
      AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWS,  completed  the  acquisition  of the
      wireless system in San Diego, for approximately  $500 in cash. On June 29,
      2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWS,  completed the  acquisition  of
      Vodafone Airtouch plc's 50% partnership  interest in CMT Partners (the Bay
      Area  Properties),  which  holds a  controlling  interest in five Bay Area
      markets  including  San  Francisco and San Jose,  for  approximately  $1.8
      billion in cash,  thereby  giving  AT&T  Wireless  Group a 100%  ownership
      interest  in  this  partnership.   These  transactions  were  recorded  as
      purchases.  Accordingly,  the operating  results of the acquired  entities
      have been included in the accompanying combined financial statements since
      their dates of  acquisition.  The excess of aggregate  purchase price over
      the fair  value of net  tangible  assets  acquired,  based on  preliminary
      allocations,  totaled  $3,082 and has been  assigned to  licensing  costs,
      goodwill and other  intangible  assets and is being amortized over periods
      of five to 40 years.  We may make  refinements  to the  allocations of the
      purchase prices in future periods as the related fair value  appraisals of
      certain assets and  liabilities  are finalized.  Prior to  consummation of
      this  transaction,  AT&T Wireless  Group's 50%  ownership  interest in CMT

      Partners was  accounted  for as an equity  investment.  As a result of the
      transaction,  $190 was  reclassified  from  investments to goodwill on the
      accompanying combined balance sheet.

            On June 1, 2000,  AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWS,  completed its
      acquisition of the assets of Wireless One Network, L.P., for $859 in cash,
      acquiring  wireless  systems  in  Northwest  and  Southwest  Florida.  The
      transaction was recorded as a purchase. Accordingly, the operating results
      of Wireless  One Network,  L.P.,  have been  included in the  accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of
      aggregate  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of net  tangible  assets
      acquired totaled $792 and has been assigned to licensing  costs,  goodwill
      and other intangible assets and is being amortized over periods of five to
      40 years.

          In June 2000, AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWS, sold its interest in
      two equity investments for cash resulting in pretax gains of approximately
      $141.

          On August 2, 1999, AT&T,  through AWPCS,  completed its acquisition of
      Honolulu Cellular Telephone Company for $194 in cash. AT&T contributed its
      interest in Honolulu Cellular to AT&T Wireless Group as of the acquisition
      date. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase.  Accordingly,  the
      operating  results  of  Honolulu  Cellular  Telephone  Company  have  been
      included in the accompanying  combined financial statements since the date
      of acquisition. The excess of aggregate purchase price over the fair value
      of net tangible  assets  acquired  totaled $154, and has been allocated to
      licensing costs and goodwill and is being amortized over 40 years.

          On May 3, 1999, AT&T,  through  Winston,  acquired  Vanguard  Cellular
      Systems,  Inc.  (Vanguard) and has contributed its interest in Vanguard to
      AT&T Wireless  Group as of the date of  acquisition.  Under the agreement,
      each Vanguard  shareholder was entitled to elect to receive either cash or
      AT&T stock in exchange for their Vanguard shares subject to the limitation
      that the  overall  consideration  would  consist of 50% AT&T stock and 50%
      cash. Consummation of the merger resulted in the issuance of approximately
      12.6  million  AT&T  shares  and  payment  of $485 in cash.  In  addition,
      Vanguard had approximately $550 in debt, which was subsequently  repaid by
      AT&T. The merger with Vanguard was recorded as a purchase. Accordingly the
      operating  results of  Vanguard  have been  included  in the  accompanying
      combined financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of
      aggregate  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of net  tangible  assets
      acquired totaled $1,436 and has been assigned to licensing costs, goodwill
      and other intangible assets and is being amortized over periods of five to
      40 years. Additionally,  AT&T Wireless Group recorded $241 in deferred tax
      liabilities associated with this transaction.

          In April 1999, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, acquired Bakersfield
      Cellular  Telephone  Company in exchange for several  cellular  markets in
      Texas and cash of $77. The  acquisition  was  accounted for as a purchase.
      The excess of aggregate purchase price, including markets exchanged,  over
      the fair value of net tangible assets acquired  totaled $104, and has been
      allocated to licensing  costs and goodwill and is being  amortized over 40
      years.

      4. Acquisitions and Dispositions (Continued)

          In addition to the  acquisitions  of Honolulu  Cellular,  Vanguard and
      Bakersfield  Cellular,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS and other direct
      subsidiaries  of AT&T,  acquired other cellular  markets in Utah,  Oregon,
      California,  Idaho, and Louisiana  during 1999. All of these  acquisitions
      were accounted for as purchases.  The excess of aggregate  purchase prices
      over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired  totaled $220, and has
      been allocated to licensing costs and is being amortized over 40 years.

          In June 1999, AT&T  Wireless Group, through AWS, sold  its interest in
      WOOD-TV for cash resulting in a pretax gain of $88.

          In May 1999, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWPCS,  sold its net assets
      in the geographic  area of San Juan,  Puerto Rico,  including a portion of
      the PCS license,  to TeleCorp PCS,  Inc. for cash and  preferred  stock of
      TeleCorp resulting in a pretax gain of $11.

          In the fourth  quarter of 1998,  AT&T Wireless  Group,  through AWPCS,
      sold its net assets in the geographic area of Norfolk, Virginia, including
      a portion of the PCS license,  to Triton PCS  Holdings,  Inc. for cash and
      preferred stock of Triton resulting in a pretax gain of $29.

          Also in the  fourth  quarter of 1998,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through
      AWPCS,  sold a  portion  of its net  assets  in the  geographic  areas  of
      Cincinnati and Dayton,  Ohio,  including portions of the PCS licenses,  to
      Cincinnati Bell Wireless, LLC for cash and an ownership interest. A pretax
      gain of $24 was recognized on this transaction.

          On October 2,1998, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, sold its one-way
      messaging  services  business and a narrowband  PCS license to  Metrocall,
      Inc. in exchange for cash and preferred stock of Metrocall.  A pretax loss
      of $5 was recognized on this transaction. AT&T Wireless Group subsequently
      distributed its investment in the preferred stock of Metrocall to AT&T.

          In the second quarter of 1998, AT&T Wireless Group, through AWS, sold,
      for cash, its interest in two equity  investments  and  recognized  pretax
      gains of $195.

          In the first quarter of 1998, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, sold,
      for cash,  its equity  interest in LIN  Television  Corp. and recognized a
      pretax gain of $342.

          As a result of our  evaluation  of recent  changes in our industry and
      the views of regulatory authorities,  AT&T Wireless Group expects that the
      amortization  period for all licensing costs and goodwill  associated with
      newly acquired wireless operations will not exceed 25 years.


      5. Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges

          During the fourth quarter of 1999, AT&T Wireless Group recorded a $531
      asset impairment charge primarily  associated with the planned disposal of
      certain  wireless  communications  equipment  resulting  from a program to
      increase  capacity and operating  efficiency of the wireless  network.  As
      part of a multi-vendor program,  contracts have been executed with certain
      vendors to replace  significant  portions of the  wireless  infrastructure
      equipment  in the  Western  United  States and the  metropolitan  New York
      markets.  The program is intended to provide AT&T Wireless  Group with the
      newest technology  available and allow it to evolve to new next-generation
      digital   technology,   which  is  designed  to  provide  high-speed  data
      capabilities.

      5. Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges (Continued)

          The planned disposal of the existing wireless infrastructure equipment
      required an  evaluation of asset  impairment  in accordance  with SFAS No.
      121,   "Accounting  for  the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets  and  for
      Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed Of," to write-down these assets to their
      fair value,  which was estimated by discounting  the expected  future cash
      flows  to be  generated  by  these  assets  from  their  use and  eventual
      disposition through the date of disposal.  Since the assets will remain in
      service  from the date of the  decision to dispose of these  assets to the
      disposal   date,   the   impairment   has  been  recorded  as  accumulated
      depreciation  and the  remaining  net  book  value of the  assets  will be
      depreciated  over  this  shortened   period.  As  of  December  31,  2000,
      approximately  $320 of the asset impairment  reserve has been utilized for
      assets that have been  disposed of and written off. The remaining net book
      value of these assets was  approximately  $23 at December 31, 2000,  which
      will be depreciated over an estimated remaining useful life of 3 months.

          During 1998,  AT&T Wireless Group  recorded a pretax asset  impairment
      charge of $120, which  represented the write-down of unrecoverable  assets
      associated with nonstrategic businesses.

      7. Investments

          AT&T  Wireless  Group,   primarily   through  AWS  and  AWPCS,   holds
      investments in ventures and partnerships  that provide AT&T Wireless Group
      access  to  additional   domestic  and  international   wireless  markets.
      Substantially  all of these investments are accounted for under the equity
      method.

          At December 31, 2000 and 1999,  AT&T Wireless  Group had equity method
      investments  of $3,080 and $4,409,  respectively.  Amortization  of excess
      carrying value of $25, $19 and $52 in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively,
      is  reflected as a component  of net equity  earnings in the  accompanying
      combined  statements  of  operations.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999,  the
      carrying  value of  investments  accounted  for  under the  equity  method
      exceeded our share of the underlying  reported net assets by approximately
      $446 and $551,  respectively.  AT&T Wireless Group received  distributions
      based on its equity  interest in these  investments of $201, $232 and $233
      for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

          Ownership of significant equity investments is as follows:

      (3) On  February  28,  2000,  AWS and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation
          (Dobson)  acquired  American  Cellular  Corporation,  through  a joint
          venture, ACC Acquisitions,  LLC, for approximately $2.4 billion.  AT&T
          contributed  cash equal to AWS'  interest in the joint venture to AT&T
          Wireless Group as of the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition was
          funded  with  non-recourse  bank  debt by the joint  venture  and cash
          equity  contributions  of  approximately  $400  from  each  of the two
          partners. Dobson is responsible for day-to-day management of the joint
          venture,  which is equally owned and jointly  controlled by Dobson and
          AT&T Wireless Group. Accordingly,  this investment is accounted for as
          an equity method  investment in the  accompanying  combined  financial
          statements.

      7. Investments (Continued)

      (4) During  1998,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWPCS,  entered into a
          venture with Triton PCS  Holdings,  Inc. to build and operate  digital
          wireless networks in the Southeast and MidAtlantic areas of the United
          States.  AT&T Wireless  Group  contributed  licenses to the venture in
          exchange  for  preferred  stock.  The effect of the above  transaction
          resulted  in  a  non-cash  reclassification  of  license  balances  of
          approximately  $101 to  investments.  Additionally  during  the fourth
          quarter of 1998,  AT&T Wireless  Group,  through  AWPCS,  sold its net
          assets  in the  geographic  area of  Norfolk,  Virginia,  including  a
          portion of the PCS license,  to Triton for cash and  preferred  stock.
          Ownership  percentages  reflect  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ownership of
          common  stock,   assuming  conversion  of  all  currently  convertible
          preferred  shares to common stock.  In addition,  AT&T Wireless Group,
          through AWPCS,  holds redeemable  preferred shares in this investment,
          which are not currently  convertible to common stock.  These preferred
          shares have certain liquidation preference rights.

      (5) During  1998,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWPCS,  entered into a
          venture with TeleCorp PCS, Inc. to build and operate digital  wireless
          networks  in  portions   of  New  England  and  the   Midwestern   and
          Southeastern United States.  AT&T Wireless Group contributed  licenses
          to the  venture in exchange  for  preferred  stock.  The effect of the
          above transaction  resulted in a non-cash  reclassification of license
          balances of  approximately  $40 to  investments.  Additionally  in May
          1999, AT&T Wireless Group sold,  through AWPCS,  its net assets in the
          geographic area of San Juan,  Puerto Rico,  including a portion of the
          PCS license,  to TeleCorp for cash and  preferred  stock.  In November
          2000,  Telecorp  completed a merger with Tritel.  See Note 4 regarding
          the  discussion  of the merger.  Ownership  percentages  reflect  AT&T
          Wireless Group's ownership of common stock, assuming conversion of all
          currently  convertible  preferred shares to common stock. In addition,
          AT&T Wireless Group holds, through AWPCS,  redeemable preferred shares
          in this  investment,  which are not  currently  convertible  to common
          stock.  These  preferred  shares have certain  liquidation  preference
          rights.

      (6) In January 1999,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWPCS,  entered into a
          venture  with  Tritel,  Inc. to build and  operate a digital  wireless
          network across parts of the Southwestern  United States. AT&T Wireless
          Group  contributed  licenses to the venture in exchange for  preferred
          stock.  The  effect of the above  transaction  resulted  in a non-cash
          reclassification   of  license  balances  of   approximately   $94  to
          investments.  In  November  2000,  Telecorp  completed  a merger  with
          Tritel.  See  Note 4  regarding  the  discussion  of the  merger.  The
          December  31,  1999,  ownership  percentage  reflected  AT&T  Wireless
          Group's  ownership  of  common  stock,   assuming  conversion  of  all
          convertible  preferred  shares,  as of December  31,  1999,  to common
          stock.  In addition,  the AT&T Wireless  Group,  through  AWPCS,  held
          redeemable   preferred  shares  as  of  December  31,  1999,  in  this
          investment,   which  were  not  convertible  to  common  stock.  These
          preferred shares had certain liquidation preference rights.

      7. Investments (Continued)

      (7) During the fourth quarter of 1998,  AT&T Wireless Group sold,  through
          AWPCS,  a  portion  of its  net  assets  in the  geographic  areas  of
          Cincinnati and Dayton,  Ohio,  including portions of the PCS licenses,
          to Cincinnati Bell Wireless,  LLC for cash and an ownership  interest.
          The effect of this transaction resulted in a non-cash reclassification
          of license balances of approximately $20 to investments.

      (8) During November 2000, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWPCS, joined with
          others in the  formation of a venture,  Alaska Native  Wireless,  LLC,
          which  participated in the Federal  Communication  Commissions' recent
          auction of license  spectrum in the 1900 megahertz band, which is used
          to provide wireless services.  AT&T Wireless Group provided funding to
          the joint venture  through a combination of a  non-controlling  equity
          interest  and debt  securities  of  Alaska  Native  Wireless  totaling
          approximately  $229 as of December 31, 2000.  AT&T Wireless  Group has
          made certain future  commitments  related to this joint  venture.  See
          Note 12 for further discussion of outstanding commitments.

      (9) In August  1999,  AT&T and  British  Telecommunications  plc through a
          newly  created joint venture  acquired a 33.3%  ownership  interest in
          Rogers Wireless  Communications,  Inc.,  formerly Rogers Cantel Mobile
          Communications, Inc., for approximately $934 in cash. AT&T contributed
          its  interest in the joint  venture to AT&T  Wireless  Group as of the
          date of acquisition.  The investment is owned equally by AT&T Wireless
          Group,   through  AWS,  and  British   Telecommunications   plc.  This
          investment  is accounted  for under the equity  method  because of our
          ability to elect  certain  members of the board of  directors  of this
          entity, which we believe provides us with significant influence.

      (10)In the first  quarter  of 2000,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  was  allocated
          one-half of AT&T's interest in Japan Telecom,  which is held through a
          joint venture with British  Telecommunications plc. This investment is
          accounted for under the equity method  because of our ability to elect
          certain  members of the board of directors  of this  entity,  which we
          believe  provides  us  with  significant  influence.  See  Note 14 for
          discussion of subsequent events associated with Japan Telecom.

      (11)On October 2, 2000,  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS,  completed its
          acquisition of several interests in international ventures,  including
          Eurotel Praha in the Czech  Republic,  acquired by AT&T as a result of
          its acquisition of MediaOne in June 2000. AT&T Wireless Group acquired
          these interests from AT&T for  approximately $1 billion in cash, which
          was determined based upon a third party valuation.  Additionally, AT&T
          Wireless Group assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately
          $200 which were transferred from AT&T.

      (12)On December 8, 2000, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS,  exercised its
          options  to  purchase   additional  shares  of  stock  in  its  equity
          investment in Far EasTone Telecommunications, ltd. AT&T Wireless Group
          paid  approximately  $205 for the additional  shares and increased its
          ownership percentage to 22.70%.

      excess of  accumulated  earnings  are  recognized  as a  reduction  of our
      investment balance.  These investments,  which are covered under the scope
      of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting  for Certain  Investments in  Debt and Equity
      Securities,"  are  classified as  "available-for-sale"  and are carried at
      fair value with any  unrealized  gain or loss,  net of tax, being included
      within  our  other  comprehensive   income  as  a  component  of  combined

      8. Income Taxes

          AT&T Wireless Group is  not a separate taxable  entity for federal and
      state income tax purposes  and its results of  operations  are included in
      the  consolidated  federal  and state  income tax  returns of AT&T and its
      affiliates,  as  described  in Note  1.  The  following  table  shows  the
      principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate
      and the United States federal statutory income tax rate:

          Deferred  income tax liabilities are taxes AT&T Wireless Group expects
      to pay in future  periods.  Similarly,  deferred  income  tax  assets  are
      recorded  for  expected  reductions  in taxes  payable in future  periods.
      Deferred  income taxes arise  because of  differences  in the book and tax
      bases of certain assets and liabilities.

</TABLE>
          At December 31,  2000,  AT&T  Wireless  Group had net  operating  loss
      carryforwards  for federal and state  income tax purposes of $21 and $619,
      respectively,  expiring through 2019. AT&T Wireless Group also has federal
      tax credit carryforwards of $29 which are not subject to expiration.  AT&T
      Wireless  Group  recorded a valuation  allowance to reflect the  estimated
      amount of deferred  tax assets  which,  more likely than not,  will not be
      realized by AT&T Wireless Group.

          The  realization of AT&T Wireless  Group's  deferred tax assets is not
      dependent  upon the  consolidated  tax  group of AT&T.  On a stand  alone,
      separate  company  basis,  AT&T Wireless  Group has  sufficient  reversing
      taxable temporary  differences to warrant  recognition of its deferred tax
      assets  without  the need for any  additional  valuation  allowance.  AT&T
      Wireless Group received  payments under its tax sharing  arrangement  with
      AT&T for the net domestic tax losses and credits it had  generated.  These
      payments were recorded as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

      8. Income Taxes (Continued)

          AT&T  previously  announced that it intends to split-off AT&T Wireless
      Group (see Note 1). If it were  determined  that the  split-off  failed to
      qualify as a tax-free transaction,  a tax liability would be created which
      would have a material effect on AT&T Wireless  Group.  In addition,  there
      may be tax costs  associated  with the  split-off  that  result  from AT&T
      Wireless Group ceasing to be a member of the AT&T  consolidated tax return
      group, as well as from pre-split  transactions,  If incurred,  these costs
      could be material to AT&T Wireless Group's results.

      9. Employee Benefit Plan

          AT&T  Wireless  Group  sponsors a savings plan for the majority of its
      employees.  The plan allows  employees  to  contribute  a portion of their
      pretax income in accordance with specified guidelines.  The plan matches a
      percentage of employee  contributions  up to certain limits.  In addition,
      AT&T   Wireless   Group  may  make   discretionary   or   profit   sharing
      contributions.  Contributions  amounted to $60, $37 and $31 in 2000,  1999
      and 1998, respectively.

      10. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

          Under the AT&T 1997 Long-term  Incentive Program (Program),  which was
      effective June 1, 1997, and amended on May 19, 1999 and on March 14, 2000,
      AT&T grants stock options,  performance shares, restricted stock and other
      awards on AT&T  common  stock as well as stock  options  on AT&T  Wireless
      Group tracking stock.

          Under the  Program,  there  were 150  million  shares of common  stock
      available  for grant with a maximum of 22.5  million  common  shares  that
      could be used for awards other than stock options.  Beginning with January
      1, 2000, the remaining  shares  available for grant at December 31, of the
      prior year,  plus 1.75% of the shares of AT&T common stock  outstanding on
      January 1 of each year become  available for grant.  There is a maximum of
      37.5 million  shares that may be used for awards other than stock options.
      The  exercise  price of any stock  option is equal to the stock price when
      the option is  granted.  Generally,  the  options  vest over three or four
      years and are exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant.

          Under  the  Program,  performance  share  units  are  awarded  to  key
      employees  in the  form of  either  common  stock  or cash at the end of a
      three-year  period  based on AT&T's total  shareholder  return and certain
      financial performance targets. Under the 1987 Long-term Incentive Program,
      performance  share  units  with the same  terms  were also  awarded to key
      employees  based on AT&T's  return-to-equity  performance  compared with a
      target.

      10. Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued)

          On April 27, 2000 AT&T  created a new class of stock and  completed an
      offering  of AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock.  Under the Program as
      amended on March 14,  2000,  5% of the  outstanding  AT&T  Wireless  Group
      tracking shares became  available for grant with a maximum of 1.25% of the
      outstanding  shares  that  may be used  for  awards  other  than  options.
      Beginning  with January 1, 2001 the remaining  AT&T Wireless  Group shares
      available  for  grant  at  December  31 of the  prior  year  plus  2.0% of
      outstanding  AT&T Wireless Group tracking shares on January 1 of each year
      become  available  for grant.  The  exercise  price of any stock option is
      equal to the stock  price  when the  option  is  granted.  Generally,  the
      options vest over two to three and one half years and are  exercisable  up
      to 10 years from the date of grant. In 2000 there were no grants of awards
      other than stock  options.  On April 27, 2000,  AT&T granted AT&T Wireless
      Group tracking stock options to  substantially  all AT&T and AT&T Wireless
      Group employees.

          Under the AT&T 1996 Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (Plan),  which was
      effective  July 1,  1996,  AT&T is  authorized  to issue up to 75  million
      shares of AT&T common stock to its eligible employees.  Under the terms of
      the  Plan,  employees  may have up to 10% of their  earnings  withheld  to
      purchase AT&T's common stock.  The purchase price of the stock on the date
      of exercise  is 85% of the  average  high and low sale prices of shares on
      the New York  Stock  Exchange  for that day.  Under  the  Plan,  AT&T sold
      approximately  1,127 thousand  shares to AT&T Wireless Group  employees in
      2000,  approximately  424 thousand  shares in 1999 and  approximately  535
      thousand shares in 1998.

          AT&T and AT&T Wireless Group apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion
      No.  25,   "Accounting   for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
      interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly,  no compensation
      expense has been recognized for its stock-based  compensation  plans other
      than  for   performance-based   and  restricted  stock  awards  and  stock
      appreciation  rights  (SARs).  Compensation  costs  charged  against  AT&T
      Wireless Group's results of operations for AT&T performance-based  awards,
      restricted  stock awards and SARs for AT&T Wireless  Group  employees were
      not material in any periods presented.

          AT&T  and  AT&T  Wireless  Group  have  adopted  the   disclosure-only
      provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation." If
      AT&T Wireless Group had elected to recognize  compensation  costs based on
      the  fair  value at the date of grant  for  AT&T  awards  granted  to AT&T
      Wireless  Group  employees in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  and for AT&T Wireless
      Group awards granted to AT&T Wireless Group employees in 2000,  consistent
      with the  provisions  of SFAS No. 123,  AT&T  Wireless  Group's net income
      (loss) would have been adjusted to reflect additional compensation expense
      resulting in the following pro forma amounts:

      10. Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued)


          The pro forma effect on net income for 1998 may not be  representative
      of the pro forma effect on net income  (loss) of future years  because the
      SFAS No. 123 method of accounting for pro forma  compensation  expense has
      not been applied to options  granted prior to January 1, 1995, as all such
      options were fully vested by the end of 1998.

          There were  approximately  53,308  thousand AT&T Wireless  Group stock
      options granted to AT&T Wireless Group employees  during 2000. At the date
      of grant the weighted- average exercise price of these options granted was
      $29.23.  The  weighted-average  fair value at date of grant was $14.43 and
      was estimated using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model. The following
      weighted-average assumptions were applied: (i) expected volatility rate of
      55.0%, (ii) expected life of 4 years and (iii) risk-free  interest rate of
      6.52%.

          AT&T granted  approximately 1,082 thousand, 9,438 thousand  and 10,503
      thousand stock options to AT&T Wireless Group employees  during 2000, 1999
      and  1998,  respectively.  At the  date  of  grant,  the  weighted-average
      exercise price for AT&T options  granted to AT&T Wireless Group  employees
      during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $48.05,  $59.35 and $41.86,  respectively.
      The weighted-average fair values at date of grant for AT&T options granted
      to AT&T Wireless Group  employees  during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $14.26,
      $15.36 and $9.80, respectively, and were estimated using the Black-Scholes
      option-pricing  model.  The following  weighted-average  assumptions  were
      applied  for 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively:  (i)  expected  dividend
      yields of 1.7%,  1.7% and 2.1%, (ii) expected  volatility  rates of 31.2%,
      27.2% and 23.8%,  and (iii) risk-free  interest rates of 6.69%,  4.71% and
      5.27% and (iv) expected lives of 3.9 years, 4.9 years and 4.5 years.

      11. Fair Values of Financial Instruments

          The  carrying   amounts  of  cash  and  cash   equivalents,   accounts
      receivable,   accounts  payable  and  other  current   liabilities  are  a
      reasonable  estimate of their fair value due to the  short-term  nature of
      these instruments. The fair value of the short-term and long-term debt due
      to AT&T approximates its carrying value.

      12.Commitments and Contingencies

          In the normal course of business,  AT&T  Wireless  Group is subject to
      proceedings,  lawsuits and other claims.  Such matters are subject to many
      uncertainties   and  outcomes   are  not   predictable   with   assurance.
      Consequently,  AT&T  Wireless  Group is unable to  ascertain  the ultimate
      aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to
      these matters at December 31, 2000. AT&T Wireless Group also makes routine
      filings with the Federal  Communications  Commission and state  regulatory
      authorities.  These matters could affect the operating  results of any one
      quarter when resolved in future  periods.  However,  AT&T  Wireless  Group
      believes that after final disposition any monetary  liability or financial
      impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end would not be material to
      our annual combined financial statements.

      12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

          During January 2001,  AT&T closed its previously  announced  agreement
      with DoCoMo. Pursuant to this agreement, DoCoMo may require the repurchase
      of its investment at DoCoMo's original  purchase price, plus interest,  if
      AT&T does not complete the split-off by specified dates beginning  January
      1, 2002, or if AT&T Wireless Group fails to meet  specified  technological
      milestones.  See  Note 1 for  further  discussion  related  to the  DoCoMo
      investment.

          AT&T Wireless Group has entered into various purchase  commitments for
      network  equipment as well as handsets,  related to the development of its
      next-generation  strategy.  Those commitments  totaled $432 as of December
      31, 2000. These commitments expire between 2001 and 2004.

          During  November  2000,  AT&T Wireless Group joined with others in the
      formation of a venture, Alaska Native Wireless,  which participated in the
      Federal  Communication  Commission's recent auction of license spectrum in
      the 1900 megahertz band,  which is used to provide wireless  services.  In
      January 2001,  the auction was completed,  and Alaska Native  Wireless was
      the high bidder on approximately  $2.9 billion in licenses.  AT&T Wireless
      Group has committed to fund $2.6 billion to Alaska Native Wireless to fund
      Alaska  Native  Wireless'  purchase of licenses.  As of December 31, 2000,
      AT&T Wireless Group funded  approximately $229 of the commitment through a
      combination of a  non-controlling  equity  interest and debt securities of
      Alaska Native  Wireless.  Additionally,  in February  2001,  AT&T Wireless
      Group funded an additional $80. The remaining  approximate $2.3 billion of
      additional  funding will be made when such licenses are granted,  and will
      take the form of non-convertible  notes of Alaska Native Wireless.  At the
      fifth  anniversary  of the first date on which licenses won in the auction
      are granted to Alaska Native  Wireless,  and in addition to other means by
      which they may transfer their interests, the other owners of Alaska Native
      Wireless have the right to require AT&T Wireless  Group to purchase  their
      equity  interests.  If this right were  exercised five years after license
      grant, the purchase price could be as much as approximately $950 and would
      be  payable,  at AT&T  Wireless  Group's  option,  in  cash or  marketable
      securities.  The right to require AT&T  Wireless  Group to purchase  these
      interests may be exercised before the five-year anniversary of the license
      grant if the conditions of certain FCC  regulations  restricting  the free
      transferability  of  certain  licenses  offered  in this  auction  are met
      earlier. If the right were exercised earlier,  the purchase price would be
      calculated in generally the same way as if exercised at five years, except
      that a discount would be applied. In certain  circumstances,  if a winning
      bid of Alaska Native  Wireless is rejected or if any license granted to it
      is revoked,  AT&T Wireless  Group would be obligated to  compensate  other
      owners  for  making   capital   available  to  the  venture.   In  certain
      circumstances,  if the grant of the licenses is challenged,  AT&T Wireless
      Group  may be  obligated  to  purchase  the  interests  of  other  owners.
      Depending on when such revocation or challenge takes place, the amount may
      be material but will be less than the $950 purchase price described above.

          AT&T Wireless  Group  leases land,  buildings  and  equipment  through
      contracts that expire in various years through 2037.  Rental expense under
      operating leases was $271 in 2000, $205 in 1999, and $181 in 1998.     The
      following  table shows  the  future  minimum  rental  payments  due  under
      noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2000.

         During  2000  and  1999,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  expensed  $28 and $82,
      respectively,  for losses  associated with commitments  related to certain
      equity  investments.  Included  in the 1999 loss of $82 was AT&T  Wireless
      Group's commitment of $63 to fund the long-term debt obligations of one of
      its equity  investments,  which  fully  satisfied  AT&T  Wireless  Group's
      commitment for this equity investment.

          AT&T Wireless  Group also has various other purchase  commitments  for
      materials,  supplies and other items  incidental to the ordinary course of
      business which are not significant individually, nor in the aggregate.

      13. Related Party Transactions

         As  discussed in Note 1, AT&T has provided  necessary  working  capital
      requirements  to  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWG  and  AWS,  via  an
      attribution of a portion of the offering  proceeds,  intercompany debt and
      preferred stock, as well as capital  contributions  prior to the offering.
      Intercompany debt is reflected in the accompanying combined balance sheets
      as  "Short-term  debt  due to  AT&T"  and  "Long-term  debt  due to  AT&T"
      Preferred  stock held by AT&T is  included  in  "Combined  attributed  net
      assets" in the  accompanying  combined balance sheets.  In addition,  AT&T
      Wireless Group loaned the proceeds back to AT&T via an  intercompany  note
      receivable.

         Intercompany  interest  income on the note receivable from AT&T for the
      year ended  December 31, 2000,  totaled  $143.  There was no  intercompany
      interest  income  for the years  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998.  The
      intercompany  interest  income was determined  based upon the  methodology
      described  in  Note  1  and  is  included   within  other  income  in  the
      accompanying combined statements of operations.

          Intercompany  debt and  interest  expense was  assumed  based upon the
      methodology  discussed in Note 1.  Intercompany debt was $2,438 and $3,400
      at December  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  of which $638  represented
      short-term debt at December 31, 2000.  Intercompany  interest  expense was
      $196,  $214,  and $190,  for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and
      1998,  respectively,  of which $123,  $88 and $75, was  capitalized  as of
      December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

          The 9%  cumulative  preferred  stock held by AT&T was $3.0 billion and
      $1.0  billion as of December 31, 2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  Dividend
      requirements  were $130,  $56 and $56,  for the years ended  December  31,
      2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

      administrative   expenses  in  the  accompanying  combined  statements  of
      operations and were determined based on the methodology  described in Note
      1.

          Also  included in selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  are

      14. Subsequent Events

          In January 2001, AT&T Wireless Group executed  agreements with certain
      network   equipment   vendors,   related   to  the   development   of  its
      next-generation  network strategy.  These agreements require AT&T Wireless
      Group to buy equipment  from these  vendors  totaling  approximately  $1.8
      billion through 2004.

          Effective January 1, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group implemented the results
      of  a  review  of  the  estimated   service  lives  of  certain   wireless
      communications equipment,  primarily electronics.  Lives were shortened to
      fully depreciate all such equipment within seven years.  Similar equipment
      acquired  after  January 1, 2001,  will have  useful  lives no longer than
      seven years.

          On January 22, 2001, AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS,  completed its
      previously  announced  transaction  with  DoCoMo.  See Note 1 for  further
      discussion of the transaction.

          On  November 17, 2000,  AT&T  Wireless  Group  announced  that  AT&T's
      board of directors  had approved an  agreement  under which AT&T  Wireless
      Group  would  purchase  $200 in  Series AA  preferred  stock  from  Dobson
      Communications  Corporation.  AT&T Wireless Group,  through AWS, completed
      this  transaction  on  February  8, 2001.  The Series AA  preferred  stock
      acquired  has  a  liquidation  preference  of  $1,000  per  share  and  is
      exchangeable  into Series A convertible  preferred stock. If the Series AA
      preferred  stock is exchanged into Series A convertible  preferred  stock,
      AT&T Wireless Group will increase its ownership  interest in Dobson, on an
      as converted to common stock basis,  from its current ownership of 4.6% to
      approximately 11.6%.

          On March 23, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through AWS,  entered into
      Competitive  Advance and Revolving Credit Facilities (the "Facilities") in
      the aggregate amount of $2.5 billion  consisting of an up to $1.25 billion
      364-day  Competitive  Advance and Revolving  Credit  Facility and an up to
      $1.25 billion Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility.
      The facilities are subject to a facility fee and  utilization fee and bear
      interest at variable rates based upon, in various cases,  LIBOR, the prime
      rate or the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions.  The Facilities
      may be used for general  corporate  purposes  and are subject to customary
      covenants,  representations  and  warranties  and  events of  default.  In
      addition,  the  Facilities  contain  financial  covenants  providing for a
      maximum  total debt to total  Consolidated  Operational  EBITDA  ratio (as
      defined  in the  facilities  agreement)  not to exceed 4:0 to 1:0 for AT&T
      Wireless Group and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5:1.0.  From the
      date of the closing of the  Facilities  until the date of the split-off of
      AT&T Wireless Group,  AWS will be prohibited from declaring  and/or paying
      dividends.  The Facility  also  specifies  limitations  on AT&T's and AT&T
      Wireless Group's ability to consummate the split-off including a provision
      that  it  will  constitute  an  event  of  default  if  the  split-off  is
      consummated  without  obtaining a favorable  tax ruling from the IRS or an
      unqualified  tax opinion  that the  split-off  will  qualify as a tax-free
      transaction.  In addition, the existence of an obligation by AT&T Wireless
      Group to  repurchase  equity  interests  from  DoCoMo  may  under  certain
      circumstances constitute an event of default.

      14. Subsequent Events (continued)

          On February 26, 2001, AT&T agreed to sell its entire interest in Japan
      Telecom for approximately  $1.35 billion.  The net after-tax  proceeds are
      expected to be approximately  $1 billion.  AT&T has indicated that the net
      after-tax  proceeds  will be split evenly  between AT&T and AT&T  Wireless
      Group.   AT&T  Wireless  Group   anticipates  that  it  will  recognize  a
      significant gain on the transaction.

          On March 1, 2001,  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  through  AWS,  completed  a
      private placement of $6.5 billion in Senior Notes with maturity dates from
      2006 to 2031.  The notes pay  interest  at rates  ranging  from  7.350% to
      8.750% per annum,  and  include  customary  covenants.  The notes  include
      registration rights, such that AWS is required to exchange the notes for a
      new issue of notes  registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are to
      be declared effective no later than 240 days after the issue date.

                         LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP FINANCIALS

         (a combination of certain assets and businesses owned by AT&T)

         Liberty Media Group is a combination  of certain  assets and businesses
owned by AT&T Corp.  and not a stand-alone  entity.  As Liberty Media Group is a
tracking  stock of AT&T,  separate  financial  statements are not required to be
filed.  We are  providing  these  financial  statements  to  provide  additional
disclosures  to investors to allow them to assess the financial  performance  of
Liberty Media Group.  Presenting separate financial statements for Liberty Media
Group  does  not  indicate   that  we  have  changed  title  to  any  assets  or
responsibility for any liabilities, and does not purport to affect the rights of
any of AT&T's  creditors.  Holders of Liberty Media Group  tracking stock do not
have claims  against the assets of Liberty Media Group.  Instead,  Liberty Media
Group shareholders own a separate class of AT&T common stock that is intended to
reflect  the  financial  performance  and  economic  value  of  the  assets  and
businesses owned by AT&T that are attributed to Liberty Media Group.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
AT&T Corp.:

We have audited the accompanying  combined balance sheets of Liberty Media Group
(a combination of certain assets and businesses  owned by AT&T Corp., as defined
in note 1) ("New Liberty" or  "Successor") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the related  combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive  earnings,
attributed  net assets,  and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
the period from March 1, 1999 to December 31, 1999 (Successor  periods) and from
January 1, 1999 to February  28, 1999 and for the year ended  December  31, 1998
(Predecessor   periods).   These   combined   financial   statements   are   the
responsibility of the Companies' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

The combined  financial  statements  of Liberty  Media Group are  presented  for
purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements of AT&T
Corp. As more fully  described in note 1, the combined  financial  statements of
Liberty Media Group are intended to reflect the performance of the businesses of
AT&T Corp., that produce, acquire and distribute entertainment,  educational and
informational programming services. The combined financial statements of Liberty
Media  Group  should  be read in  conjunction  with the  consolidated  financial
statements of AT&T Corp.

In our opinion,  the  aforementioned  Successor  combined  financial  statements
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of New Liberty
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their  operations and their
cash flows for the Successor periods,  in conformity with accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Further, in our opinion, the
aforementioned  Predecessor combined financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects,  the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
Predecessor periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As discussed in note 1, effective  March 9, 1999,  AT&T Corp.,  the owner of the
assets comprising New Liberty, acquired Tele-Communications,  Inc., the owner of
the assets comprising Old Liberty, in a business combination  accounted for as a
purchase. As a result of the acquisition, the combined financial information for
the periods after the  acquisition  is presented on a different  cost basis than
that for the periods before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable.

                              "LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP"
         (a combination of certain assets and businesses owned by AT&T,
                              as defined in note 1)

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

(1)      Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying  combined financial statements include the accounts of
         the  assets  and  businesses  owned  by AT&T  Corp.  ("AT&T")  that are
         attributed to Liberty Media Group,  as defined below.  All  significant
         intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

         On March 9, 1999, AT&T acquired Tele-Communications,  Inc. ("TCI"), the
         former owner of the assets and  businesses  attributed to Liberty Media
         Group, in a merger transaction (the "AT&T Merger").  In connection with
         the AT&T Merger,  holders of shares of TCI's then  outstanding  Liberty
         Media Group  tracking  stock and TCI Ventures Group tracking stock were
         issued shares of a new targeted stock of AT&T. Each share of TCI's then
         outstanding  Liberty Media Group Series A tracking  stock was converted
         into four shares of a newly created class of AT&T tracking  stock,  the
         AT&T Liberty Media Group Class A common stock, each share of TCI's then
         outstanding  Liberty Media Group Series B tracking  stock was converted
         into four shares of a newly created class of AT&T tracking  stock,  the
         AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B common stock, each share of TCI's then
         outstanding  TCI Ventures  Group Series A tracking  stock was converted
         into 2.08 shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group Class A common stock and
         each  share of TCI's  then  outstanding  TCI  Ventures  Group  Series B
         tracking  stock was  converted  into 2.08 shares of AT&T Liberty  Media
         Group Class B common stock. The AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common
         stock and the AT&T Class B Liberty Media Group common stock  (together,
         the AT&T Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock) are tracking  stocks of
         AT&T designed to reflect the economic performance of the businesses and
         assets of AT&T attributed to the Liberty Media Group.

         Effective  with  the AT&T  Merger,  each  share  of  TCI's  Convertible
         Preferred Stock Series C-Liberty Media was converted into 225 shares of
         AT&T  Liberty  Media Group Class A common stock and each share of TCI's
         Redeemable  Convertible  Liberty Media Group Preferred Stock,  Series H
         was  converted  into 2.3625  shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group Class A
         common stock.  In general,  the holders of shares of AT&T Liberty Media
         Group Class A common  stock and the  holders of shares of AT&T  Liberty
         Media Group Class B common  stock will vote  together as a single class
         with  the  holders  of  shares  of AT&T  common  stock  on all  matters
         presented  to such  stockholders,  with the holders  being  entitled to
         three-eightieths  (3/80th)  of a vote  for each  share of AT&T  Liberty
         Media Group Class A common stock held,  three-eighths (3/8th) of a vote
         for each share of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group Class B common  stock held
         and 1 vote per share of AT&T common stock held.

         The AT&T  Merger  has been  accounted  for using the  purchase  method.
         Accordingly,  Liberty Media Group's  assets and  liabilities  have been
         recorded at their respective fair market values  therefore,  creating a
         new cost basis.  For financial  reporting  purposes the AT&T Merger and
         related restructuring transactions are deemed to have occurred on March
         1, 1999. Accordingly, for periods prior to March 1, 1999 the assets and
         liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and the related combined
         financial statements are sometimes referred to herein as "Old Liberty",
         and for  periods  subsequent  to  February  28,  1999  the  assets  and
         liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and the related combined
         financial statements are sometimes referred to herein as "New Liberty".
         The "Company"  and "Liberty  Media Group" refer to both New Liberty and
         Old Liberty.

         Immediately  prior  to  the  AT&T  Merger,  certain  assets  previously
         attributed to Old Liberty (including,  among others, the shares of AT&T
         Common Stock received in the merger of AT&T and Teleport Communications
         Group,  Inc.   ("Teleport"),   Old  Liberty's   interests  in  At  Home
         Corporation  ("@Home"),  the National Digital Television  Center,  Inc.
         ("NDTC") and Western Tele-Communications, Inc.) were attributed to "TCI
         Group" (a group of TCI's assets,  which,  prior to the AT&T Merger, was
         comprised   primarily  of  TCI's  domestic  cable  and   communications
         business)  in  exchange  for  approximately  $5.5  billion in cash (the
         "Asset Transfers"). Also, upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, through
         a new tax  sharing  agreement  between  Liberty  Media  Group and AT&T,
         Liberty  Media Group is entitled  to the  benefit of  approximately  $2
         billion in net operating loss  carryforwards  available to the entities
         included in TCI's consolidated  income tax return as of the date of the
         AT&T  Merger.  Such net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are subject to
         adjustment by the Internal  Revenue  Service ("IRS") and are subject to
         limitations  on usage which may affect the  ultimate  amount  utilized.
         Additionally,  certain  warrants to purchase  shares of Motorola,  Inc.
         ("Motorola") (successor to General Instruments  Corporation) ("Motorola
         Warrants")  previously  attributed  to TCI  Group  were  attributed  to
         Liberty Media Group in exchange for approximately $176 million in cash.
         Certain agreements entered into at the time of the AT&T Merger provide,
         among other things,  for preferred vendor status to Liberty Media Group
         for digital basic  distribution  on AT&T's  systems of new  programming
         services  created by Liberty  Media Group and for a renewal of existing
         affiliation agreements.

         The following table represents the summary balance sheet of Old Liberty
         at February 28, 1999 prior to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of the AT&T Merger and the opening  summary balance sheet
         of New Liberty  subsequent to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of  the  AT&T  Merger.  Certain  pre-merger  transactions
         occurring  between  March 1, 1999 and March 9, 1999 that  affected  Old
         Liberty's  attributed  net  assets,  gains on  issuance  of  equity  by
         subsidiaries  and  stock   compensation  have  been  reflected  in  the

         At December 31, 2000,  Liberty  Media Group  consisted  principally  of
         attributed assets and businesses of AT&T related to the following:

         o        AT&T's  assets  and  businesses   which  provide   programming
                  services  including  production,  acquisition and distribution
                  through   all   available   formats   and  media  of   branded
                  entertainment,  educational and informational  programming and
                  software, including multimedia products;

         o        AT&T's assets and businesses engaged in electronic  retailing,
                  direct  marketing,  advertising  sales relating to programming
                  services, infomercials and transaction processing;

         o        certain   of  AT&T's   assets   and   businesses   engaged  in
                  international  cable,  telephony and  programming  businesses;
                  and,

         o        AT&T's  holdings  in a  class  of  tracking  stock  of  Sprint
                  Corporation (the "Sprint PCS Group Stock").

         The assets  and  businesses  outlined  above are  principally  owned by
         Liberty  Media   Corporation  and  its   subsidiaries.   Liberty  Media
         Corporation is a wholly owned  subsidiary of AT&T.  For  convenience of
         discussion,  assets and properties  acquired,  owned, or disposed of by
         subsidiaries  of AT&T that are  attributed  to Liberty  Media Group are
         referred to herein as being  acquired,  owned or disposed of by Liberty
         Media Group. The shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group common stock issued
         in the AT&T Merger are intended to reflect the separate  performance of
         the assets  and  businesses  attributed  to Liberty  Media  Group.  The
         combined financial  statements of Liberty Media Group are presented for
         purposes  of  additional   analysis  of  the   consolidated   financial
         statements  of  AT&T  and  should  be  read in  conjunction  with  such
         consolidated financial statements.

         The attribution of assets and businesses to Liberty Media Group for the
         purpose of  preparing  these  combined  financial  statements  does not
         affect the  ownership or the  respective  legal title to such assets or
         responsibility for liabilities of AT&T or any of its subsidiaries. AT&T
         and  its  subsidiaries  each  continue  to  be  responsible  for  their
         respective  liabilities.  Holders of each class of AT&T  Liberty  Media
         Group tracking stock are common stockholders of AT&T and are subject to
         risks  associated with an investment in AT&T and all of its businesses,
         assets and  liabilities.  The  issuance  of AT&T  Liberty  Media  Group
         tracking stock does not affect the rights of creditors of AT&T.

         The  financial  impacts of AT&T issuing and  purchasing  shares of AT&T
         Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock are  reflected in these  combined
         financial statements for Liberty Media Group.

         Pursuant to amended  corporate  governance  documents  for the entities
         attributed to the Liberty Media Group and certain agreements among AT&T
         and TCI,  the  business  of Liberty  Media  Group will  continue  to be
         managed by certain persons who were members of TCI's  management  prior
         to the AT&T  Merger.  As a  result,  AT&T  does not have a  controlling
         financial  interest for financial  reporting  purposes over the Liberty
         Media Group and  therefore  accounts for the Liberty  Media Group as an
         equity method investment.

(2)      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         Cash and Cash Equivalents

         Cash equivalents  consist of investments which are readily  convertible
         into cash and have  maturities  of three  months or less at the time of
         acquisition.

         Receivables

         Receivables  are reflected  net of an allowance for doubtful  accounts.
         Such allowance at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was not material.

         Program Rights

         Prepaid  program rights are amortized on a film-by-film  basis over the
         anticipated number of exhibitions. Committed program rights and program
         rights  payable are recorded at the estimated cost of the programs when
         the film is available  for airing less  prepayments.  These amounts are
         amortized  on a  film-by-film  basis  over the  anticipated  number  of
         exhibitions.

         Investments

         All marketable  equity securities held by the Company are classified as
         available-for-sale  and are carried at fair value.  Unrealized  holding
         gains and losses on  securities  classified as  available-for-sale  are
         carried net of taxes as a component of accumulated other  comprehensive
         earnings in combined  attributed net assets.  Realized gains and losses
         are determined on a specific-identification basis.

         Other investments in which the ownership  interest is less than 20% and
         are not  considered  marketable  securities are carried at the lower of
         cost or net realizable  value.  For those  investments in affiliates in
         which the Company's voting interest is 20% to 50%, the equity method of
         accounting  is  generally  used.  Under this  method,  the  investment,
         originally  recorded at cost,  is adjusted to recognize  the  Company's
         share of net earnings or losses of the  affiliates as they occur rather
         then as dividends or other  distributions are received,  limited to the
         extent of the Company's  investment in, advances to and commitments for
         the  investee.  The  Company's  share  of net  earnings  or  losses  of
         affiliates  includes the  amortization  of the  difference  between the
         Company's investment and its share of the net assets of the investee.

         Subsequent to the AT&T Merger,  changes in the Company's  proportionate
         share of the  underlying  equity of an attributed  subsidiary or equity
         method  investee,  which result from the issuance of additional  equity
         securities  by such  attributed  subsidiary  or  equity  investee,  are
         recognized as gains or losses in the Company's  combined  statements of
         attributed net assets.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         The Company  continually reviews its investments to determine whether a
         decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary.  If
         the  decline in fair value is deemed to be other  than  temporary,  the
         cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and the amount
         of the write-down is included in the combined  statements of operations
         as an impairment of investments.

         Property and Equipment

         Property and equipment,  including significant improvements,  is stated
         at cost.  Depreciation  is  computed  on a  straight-line  basis  using
         estimated useful lives of 3 to 20 years for support equipment and 10 to
         40 years for buildings and improvements.

         Excess Cost Over Acquired Net Assets

         Excess cost over acquired net assets consists of the difference between
         the cost of acquiring  non-cable entities and amounts assigned to their
         tangible  assets.  Such amounts are amortized on a straight-line  basis
         over periods ranging from 5 to 20 years.

         Franchise Costs

         Franchise  costs generally  include the difference  between the cost of
         acquiring  cable  companies  and amounts  allocated  to their  tangible
         assets.  Such amounts are  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over 20
         years.

         Impairment of Long-lived Assets

         The Company  periodically  reviews the  carrying  amounts of  property,
         plant and  equipment  and its  intangible  assets to determine  whether
         current events or  circumstances  warrant  adjustments to such carrying
         amounts. If an impairment adjustment is deemed necessary,  such loss is
         measured by the amount that the carrying  value of such assets  exceeds
         their fair value.  Considerable  management  judgment is  necessary  to
         estimate the fair value of assets,  accordingly,  actual  results could
         vary  significantly  from such estimates.  Assets to be disposed of are
         carried at the lower of their  financial  statement  carrying amount or
         fair value less costs to sell.

         Minority Interests

         Recognition  of  minority  interests'  share of  losses  of  attributed
         subsidiaries  is  generally  limited  to the  amount  of such  minority
         interests'  allocable  portion of the common equity of those attributed
         subsidiaries.  Further,  the minority interests' share of losses is not
         recognized  if the  minority  holders  of common  equity of  attributed
         subsidiaries  have the right to cause the  Company to  repurchase  such
         holders' common equity.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         Preferred  stock (and  accumulated  dividends  thereon)  of  attributed
         subsidiaries are included in minority interests in equity of attributed
         subsidiaries.  Dividend  requirements  on  such  preferred  stocks  are
         reflected as minority interests in earnings of attributed  subsidiaries
         in the accompanying combined statements of operations and comprehensive
         earnings.

         Foreign Currency Translation

         The  functional  currency of the Company is the United States  ("U.S.")
         dollar.  The functional  currency of the Company's  foreign  operations
         generally is the applicable local currency for each attributed  foreign
         subsidiary and foreign equity method  investee.  Assets and liabilities
         of attributed  foreign  subsidiaries  and foreign equity  investees are
         translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date,
         and the combined  statements of operations  and the Company's  share of
         the  results  of  operations  of  its  foreign  equity  affiliates  are
         translated  at  the  average   exchange  rates  in  effect  during  the
         applicable  period.  The resulting  unrealized  cumulative  translation
         adjustment,  net of applicable income taxes, is recorded as a component
         of accumulated other comprehensive  earnings in combined attributed net
         assets.

         Transactions  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional
         currency  are  recorded  based  on  exchange  rates  at the  time  such
         transactions  arise.  Subsequent  changes in exchange  rates  result in
         transaction  gains and losses which are  reflected in the  accompanying
         combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive   earnings  as
         unrealized  (based  on the  applicable  period  end  exchange  rate) or
         realized upon settlement of the transactions.

         Unless  otherwise  indicated,   convenience   translations  of  foreign
         currencies into U.S.  dollars are calculated  using the applicable spot
         rate at December 31, 2000, as published in The Wall Street Journal.

         Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

         Liberty  Media  Group uses  various  derivative  instruments  including
         equity collars,  put spread collars,  and interest rate swaps to manage
         fair value risk associated  with certain  investments and interest rate
         risk on certain indebtedness.  Derivative instruments are generally not
         used for speculative purposes.  The derivative  instruments may involve
         elements of credit and market risk in excess of amounts  recognized  in
         the financial  statements.  Liberty Media Group  monitors its positions
         and the credit  quality of counter  parties,  consisting  primarily  of
         major financial institutions, and does not anticipate nonperformance by
         any counter-party.

         Disclosures  regarding the fair value of derivative and other financial
         instruments  are  included  in  notes  5 and 8.  Fair  value  of  these
         instruments  is based on market quotes or option  pricing  models using
         the historical volatility of the underlying security.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  Accounting  for
         Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  as amended by Statement
         of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 137,  Accounting for Derivative
         Instruments and Hedging  Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of
         FASB Statement No. 133, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No. 138,  Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain
         Hedging Activities, is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2001.
         Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133 requires that an
         entity  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets  or  liabilities
         measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of
         a derivative  depends on the use of the  derivative.  Adoption of these
         new accounting  standards will result in cumulative after-tax increases
         in net earnings of  approximately  $800 million and reductions in other
         comprehensive  earnings  of  approximately  $300  million  in the first
         quarter of 2001.  The adoption will also impact assets and  liabilities
         recorded on the balance sheet.

         Revenue Recognition

         Programming   revenue  is   recognized   in  the  period  during  which
         programming   is   provided,   pursuant  to   affiliation   agreements.
         Advertising revenue is recognized,  net of agency  commissions,  in the
         period during which underlying  advertisements  are broadcast.  Revenue
         from post-production  services is recognized in the period the services
         are rendered. Cable and other distribution revenue is recognized in the
         period  that  services  are  rendered.  Cable  installation  revenue is
         recognized  in the period the  related  services  are  provided  to the
         extent of direct  selling costs.  Any remaining  amount is deferred and
         recognized  over  the  estimated  average  period  that  customers  are
         expected to remain connected to the cable distribution system.

         Stock Based Compensation

         Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123,  Accounting  for
         Stock-Based   Compensation  ("Statement  123"),  establishes  financial
         accounting   and   reporting   standards   for   stock-based   employee
         compensation  plans as well as  transactions  in which an entity issues
         its equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non-employees.
         As allowed by Statement 123,  Liberty Media Group  continues to account
         for stock-based  compensation  pursuant to Accounting  Principles Board
         Opinion No. 25 ("APB Opinion No. 25").

         Compensation  relating to stock options with tandem stock  appreciation
         rights  ("SARs")  granted to employees  of Liberty  Media Group and its
         subsidiaries  have  been  recorded  as  variable  award  plans  in  the
         accompanying  combined financial statements pursuant to APB Opinion No.
         25.  Liabilities  under these  awards are subject to future  adjustment
         based upon vesting  provisions  and the market value of the  underlying
         security and,  ultimately,  on the final  determination of market value
         when the  rights  are  exercised.  The  amount  of  compensation  under
         Statement 123 would not have been significantly different from what has
         been reflected in the accompanying combined financial statements due to
         substantially  all of Liberty  Media  Group's stock option plans having
         tandem SARs,  which are treated as liabilities for financial  statement
         purposes and require periodic  remeasurement under both APB Opinion No.
         25 and Statement 123.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         Agreements that may require Liberty Media Group to reacquire  interests
         in  subsidiaries  held by  officers  and  employees  in the  future are
         marked-to-market  periodically  with  corresponding  adjustments  being
         recorded to stock compensation expense.

         Reclassifications

         Estimates

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements  and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         USAI

         USAI owns and operates businesses in network and television production,
         television  broadcasting,  electronic retailing,  ticketing operations,
         and  internet  services.  At December  31,  2000,  Liberty  Media Group
         directly  and  indirectly  held 74.4  million  shares of USAI's  common
         stock.  Liberty  Media  Group  also held  shares  directly  in  certain
         subsidiaries of USAI which are  exchangeable  into 79 million shares of
         USAI common stock.  Liberty Media Group's  direct  ownership of USAI is
         currently  restricted  by  Federal  Communications  Commission  ("FCC")
         regulations.  The exchange of these shares can be accomplished  only if
         there is a change to  existing  regulations  or if Liberty  Media Group
         obtains  permission  from the FCC. If the exchange of subsidiary  stock
         into USAI common stock was  completed  at December  31,  2000,  Liberty
         Media Group would own 153.4 million shares or  approximately  21% (on a
         fully-diluted  basis) of USAI common  stock.  USAI's common stock had a
         closing market value of $19.44 per share on December 31, 2000.  Liberty
         Media  Group   accounts  for  its   investments  in  USAI  and  related
         subsidiaries on a combined basis under the equity method.

         In  February  1998,  USAI paid cash and  issued  shares  and one of its
         subsidiaries  issued  shares  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of
         certain   assets  from   Universal   Studios,   Inc.  (the   "Universal
         Transaction").   Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  an  increase  to  its
         investment  in  USAI  of  $54  million  and  an  increase  to  combined
         attributed net assets of $33 million (after  deducting  deferred income
         taxes of $21 million) as a result of this share issuance.

         USAI  issued  shares in June 1998 to  acquire  the  remaining  stock of
         Ticketmaster   Group,  Inc.  which  it  did  not  previously  own  (the
         "Ticketmaster  Transaction").  Liberty Media Group recorded an increase
         to its  investment  in USAI of $52  million and an increase to combined
         attributed net assets of $31 million (after  deducting  deferred income
         taxes of $21 million) as a result of this share  issuance.  No gain was
         recognized in the combined  statement of operations  and  comprehensive
         earnings  for  either the  Universal  Transaction  or the  Ticketmaster
         Transaction  due  primarily  to  Liberty  Media  Group's  intention  to
         purchase additional equity interests in USAI.

                                   (continued)

         In connection with the Universal  Transaction,  Liberty Media Group was
         granted an  antidilutive  right with respect to any future  issuance of
         USAI's common stock, subject to certain limitations, that enables it to
         maintain its percentage ownership interests in USAI.

         Telewest

         Telewest   currently  operates  and  constructs  cable  television  and
         telephone systems in the UK. Flextech Limited ("Flextech") develops and
         sells a variety of  television  programming  in the UK. In April  2000,
         Telewest  acquired  Flextech.  As a result,  each share of Flextech was
         exchanged  for  3.78 new  Telewest  shares.  Prior to the  acquisition,
         Liberty  Media  Group  owned an  approximate  37%  equity  interest  in
         Flextech  and a 22% equity  interest  in  Telewest.  As a result of the
         acquisition,  Liberty  Media  Group owns an  approximate  24.6%  equity
         interest in  Telewest.  Liberty  Media Group  recognized a $649 million
         gain (excluding related tax expense of $227 million) on the acquisition
         based on the  difference  between the carrying  value of Liberty  Media
         Group's  interest in Flextech and the fair value of the Telewest shares
         received. At December 31, 2000 Liberty Media Group indirectly owned 724
         million  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  Telewest  ordinary  shares.
         Telewest's  ordinary shares reported a closing price of $1.58 per share
         on December 31, 2000.

         Effective  September 1, 1998,  Telewest and General Cable PLC ("General
         Cable")  consummated  a merger (the  "General  Cable  Merger") in which
         holders of General Cable received New Telewest  shares and cash.  Based
         upon Telewest's closing price of $1.51 per share on April 14, 1998, the
         General Cable Merger was valued at approximately $1.1 billion. The cash
         portion of the General  Cable Merger was  financed  through an offer to
         qualifying Telewest  shareholders for the purchase of approximately 261
         million  new  Telewest  shares  at a price  of  $1.57  per  share  (the
         "Telewest  Offer").  Liberty  Media  Group  subscribed  to  85  million
         Telewest  ordinary  shares  at an  aggregate  cost of $133  million  in
         connection  with the Telewest  Offer.  In  connection  with the General
         Cable  Merger,  Liberty Media Group  converted  its entire  holdings of
         Telewest  convertible  preference  shares  (133  million  shares)  into
         Telewest  ordinary  shares.  As a result of the General  Cable  Merger,
         Liberty Media Group's ownership  interest in Telewest decreased to 22%.
         In  connection  with the  increase  in  Telewest's  equity,  net of the
         dilution of Liberty Media Group's  interest in Telewest,  that resulted
         from the General Cable Merger,  Liberty Media Group recorded a non-cash
         gain of $60 million  (before  deducting  deferred  income  taxes of $21
         million) during 1998.

         Gemstar

         Gemstar is a leading  global  technology  and media company  focused on
         consumer entertainment. The common stock of Gemstar is publicly traded.
         At December 31, 2000,  Liberty Media Group held 87.5 million  shares of
         Gemstar  common  stock.  Gemstar's  stock  reported a closing  price of
         $46.13 per share on December 31, 2000.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>
         On July 12,  2000,  TV Guide and  Gemstar  completed  a merger  whereby
         Gemstar acquired TV Guide. TV Guide shareholders  received .6573 shares
         of Gemstar  common stock in exchange  for each share of TV Guide.  As a
         result of this  transaction,  133  million  shares of TV Guide  held by
         Liberty Media Group were  exchanged for 87.5 million  shares of Gemstar
         common  stock.   Following   the  merger,   Liberty  Media  Group  owns
         approximately  21.4% of Gemstar.  Liberty Media Group recognized a $4.4
         billion gain (before  deducting  deferred income taxes of $1.7 billion)
         on such transaction based on the difference  between the carrying value
         of Liberty Media Group's interest in TV Guide and the fair value of the
         Gemstar securities received.

         UnitedGlobalCom

         UnitedGlobalCom is a global broadband communications provider of video,
         voice and data services with operations in over 20 countries throughout
         the  world.  At  December  31,  2000,  Liberty  Media  Group  owned  an
         approximate   10.9%  economic   ownership   interest   representing  an
         approximate  36.8% voting  interest in  UnitedGlobalCom.  Liberty Media
         Group owns 9.9 million shares of  UnitedGlobalCom  Class B common stock
         and .6 million  shares of  UnitedGlobalCom  Class A common  stock.  The
         UnitedGlobalCom  Class B common stock is convertible,  on a one-for-one
         basis,  into  UnitedGlobalCom  Class A common stock.  UnitedGlobalCom's
         Class A common  stock  reported a closing  price of $13.63 per share on
         December 31, 2000.

         Sprint PCS

         Liberty  Media  Group  and  certain  of its  consolidated  subsidiaries
         collectively  are the beneficial  owners of  approximately  197 million
         shares  of  Sprint  PCS  Group  stock  and  certain  other  instruments
         convertible into such securities (the "Sprint Securities").  The Sprint
         PCS Group stock is a tracking stock intended to reflect the performance
         of Sprint's  domestic  wireless  PCS  operations.  Liberty  Media Group
         accounts  for  its   investment   in  the  Sprint   Securities   as  an
         available-for-sale security.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         Pursuant  to a final  judgment  (the  "Final  Judgment")  agreed  to by
         Liberty Media Group,  AT&T and the United States  Department of Justice
         (the "DOJ") on December 31, 1998,  Liberty Media Group  transferred all
         of its  beneficially  owned  securities of Sprint PCS to a trustee (the
         "Trustee")  prior to the AT&T  Merger.  The Final  Judgment,  which was
         entered by the United States District Court of the District of Columbia
         on August 23, 1999, requires the Trustee, on or before May 23, 2002, to
         dispose  of a portion  of the  Sprint  Securities  sufficient  to cause
         Liberty  Media  Group  to  beneficially  own no  more  than  10% of the
         outstanding Sprint PCS Group common stock - Series 1 on a fully diluted
         basis on such date. On or before May 23, 2004,  the Trustee must divest
         the remainder of the Sprint  Securities  beneficially  owned by Liberty
         Media Group.

         The Final Judgment requires that the Trustee vote the Sprint Securities
         beneficially   owned  by  Liberty  Media  Group  and  its  consolidated
         subsidiaries  in  the  same  proportion  as  other  holders  of  Sprint
         Securities so long as such securities are held by the trust.  The Final
         Judgment  also  prohibits  the  acquisition  by Liberty  Media Group of
         additional  Sprint  Securities,  with certain  exceptions,  without the
         prior written consent of the DOJ.

         On November 23, 1998,  Liberty Media Group exchanged its investments in
         certain wireless  businesses ("PCS Ventures") for the Sprint Securities
         (the "PCS  Exchange").  Liberty Media Group recorded a non-cash gain of
         $1.9 billion (before  deducting  deferred income taxes of $647 million)
         on the PCS Exchange based on the difference between the carrying amount
         of Liberty Media Group's equity method interest in the PCS Ventures and
         the fair value of the Sprint Securities received.

         Time Warner

         Liberty  Media Group holds shares of a series of Time  Warner's  series
         common stock with limited voting rights (the "TW Exchange  Stock") that
         are convertible  into an aggregate of 114 million shares of Time Warner
         common stock.  Liberty Media Group  accounts for its investment in Time
         Warner as an available-for-sale security.

         On January 11, 2001,  Time Warner and America  Online,  Inc.  completed
         their  merger,  pursuant to which each share of the Time Warner  common
         stock held by Liberty Media Group was  converted  into 1.5 shares of an
         identical  series of stock of AOL Time Warner Inc. ("AOL Time Warner").
         Following this conversion,  Liberty Media Group owns  approximately 171
         million shares of AOL Time Warner,  which  represents an approximate 4%
         interest in the combined entity.

         Pursuant  to an option  granted by Liberty  Media  Group,  Time  Warner
         acquired Southern Satellite Systems,  Inc.,  effective January 1, 1998,
         for $213 million in cash. Liberty Media Group recognized a $515 million
         pre-tax gain in connection  with such  transaction in the first quarter
         of 1998.

         News Corp.

         On July 15,  1999,  News  Corp.  acquired  Liberty  Media  Group's  50%
         interest in  Fox/Liberty  Networks in exchange  for 51.8  million  News
         Corp.  American  Depository  Receipts ("ADRs")  representing  preferred
         limited voting  ordinary  shares of News Corp. Of the 51.8 million ADRs
         received,  3.6 million were placed in an escrow (the  "Escrow  Shares")
         pending  an  independent  third  party  valuation,   as  of  the  third
         anniversary of the transaction.  The remainder of the 51.8 million ADRs
         received  (the  "Restricted  Shares") are subject to a two-year  lockup
         which  restricts  any  transfer of the  securities  for a period of two
         years from the date of the  transaction.  Liberty Media Group  recorded
         the Restricted Shares at fair value of $1,403 million, which included a
         discount from market value due to the two-year restriction on transfer,
         resulting  in a $13  million  gain  on the  transaction.  In a  related
         transaction,  Liberty Media Group acquired from News Corp. 28.1 million
         additional ADRs  representing  preferred limited voting ordinary shares
         of News Corp.  for  approximately  $695  million.  Liberty  Media Group
         accounts  for its  investment  in News Corp.  as an  available-for-sale
         security.

         Motorola

         On January 5,  2000,  Motorola  completed  the  acquisition  of General
         Instrument  through a merger of General  Instrument with a wholly owned
         subsidiary  of Motorola.  In connection  with the merger  Liberty Media
         Group  received 54 million  shares and  warrants to purchase 37 million
         shares of Motorola common stock in exchange for its holdings in General
         Instrument.   Liberty  Media  Group  recognized  a  $2.2  billion  gain
         (excluding  related  tax expense of $883  million) on such  transaction
         during the first  quarter of 2000 based on the  difference  between the
         carrying value of Liberty Media Group's interest in General  Instrument
         and the fair value of the Motorola  securities  received.  During 2000,
         Liberty  Media Group  exercised a warrant to purchase  approximately  9
         million  shares of Motorola  common stock at an exercise price of $8.26
         per share. At December 31, 2000 Liberty Media Group holds approximately
         63 million  shares of  Motorola  common  stock and vested  warrants  to
         purchase an additional 28 million shares of such common stock.

         AT&T

         During July 1998, Teleport was acquired by AT&T and Liberty Media Group
         received in exchange for all of its interest in Teleport  approximately
         70.4  million  shares  of  AT&T  common  stock.   Liberty  Media  Group
         recognized a $2.3 billion gain  (excluding  related tax expense of $883
         million) on such transaction  during the third quarter of 1998 based on
         the  difference  between the carrying  value of Liberty  Media  Group's
         interest  in  Teleport  and the fair  value of the  AT&T  common  stock
         received.

         Management estimates the fair market value of all of its investments in
         available-for-sale  securities and others  aggregated $19.7 billion and
         $29.2 billion at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively.
         Management  calculates  market  values  using a variety  of  approaches
         including  multiple  of cash flow,  per  subscriber  value,  a value of
         comparable  public or private  businesses  or  publicly  quoted  market
         prices. No independent appraisals were conducted for those assets.

         Equity Collars and Put Spread Collars

         The Company enters into equity collars and put spread collars to manage
         pricing risk  associated  with its  investments  in certain  marketable
         securities.  These  instruments  are  recorded  at fair value  based on
         option pricing models using the historical volatility of the underlying
         security.  Accounting  for  changes in fair value of these  instruments
         depends on the  amount of  correlation  between  the change in the fair
         value of the  instrument  and the  offsetting  change in the underlying
         equity security.  Equity collars generally have a high correlation with
         the underlying security, while put spread collars generally do not have
         high correlation.  Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the equity
         collar are  recorded  as an  adjustment  to the  carrying  value of the
         related   investment  with  an  offsetting  change  recorded  in  other
         comprehensive  earnings.  The  offsetting  change  in the  value of put
         spread collars is recorded in the combined  statements of operations as
         unrealized  gains  on  financial   instruments.   The  following  table
         illustrates  the fair value of the  Company's  equity  collars  and put
         spread collars as follows:

(6)      Impairment of Investments

         During the year ended December 31, 2000, Liberty Media Group determined
         that its investments in ICG  Communications,  Inc.  ("ICG"),  Teligent,
         Motorola,  Primedia,  Inc. and certain  others  experienced  other than
         temporary  declines  in  value.  As a  result,  the cost  bases of such
         investments  were adjusted to their  respective fair values at December
         31,  2000  based  primarily  on  recent  quoted  market  prices.  These
         adjustments  resulted in realized losses of approximately  $2.8 billion
         and  are  reflected  as  impairment  of  investments  in  the  combined
         statements of operations.

(7)      Acquisitions and Dispositions

         2000

         Associated Group, Inc. ("Associated Group")

         On January 14, 2000,  Liberty Media Group  completed its acquisition of
         Associated  Group pursuant to a merger  agreement  among AT&T,  Liberty
         Media Group and  Associated  Group.  Under the merger  agreement,  each
         share of  Associated  Group's  Class A common  stock and Class B common
         stock  was  converted  into  0.49634  shares of AT&T  common  stock and
         2.41422 shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common stock.  Prior
         to the merger, Associated Group's primary assets were (1) approximately
         19.7  million  shares of AT&T  common  stock,  (2)  approximately  46.8
         million  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common  stock,  (3)
         approximately  10.6 million  shares of AT&T Class B Liberty Media Group
         common stock, (4) approximately  21.4 million shares of common stock of
         Teligent,  and (5) all of the  outstanding  shares of  common  stock of
         TruePosition,  Inc.,  which  provides  location  services  for wireless
         carriers and users  designed to determine  the location of any wireless
         transmitter,   including  cellular  and  PCS  telephones.   Immediately
         following  the  completion  of  the  merger,  all  of  the  assets  and
         businesses of Associated Group were transferred to Liberty Media Group.
         All of the shares of AT&T  common  stock,  AT&T  Class A Liberty  Media
         Group  common  stock and AT&T Class B Liberty  Media Group common stock
         previously held by Associated Group were retired by AT&T.

         The acquisition of Associated Group was accounted for as a purchase and
         the $17  million  excess of the fair value of the net  assets  acquired
         over the purchase price is being  amortized over ten years. As a result
         of the issuance of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common  stock,  net
         of the shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common stock acquired
         in this  transaction,  Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  a $778  million
         increase to combined attributed net assets.

         On March 16, 2000,  Liberty Media Group  purchased  shares of preferred

         Media Group's  economic  interest in  approximately 5 million shares of
         Sprint  PCS Group  stock,  valued  at $300  million.  During  the third
         quarter of 2000, TCI Satellite Entertainment,  Inc. changed its name to

         Cumulative  Convertible  Voting Preferred Stock. The Series A preferred
         stock does not have voting rights,  while the Series B preferred  stock
         gives  Liberty  Media Group  approximately  85% of the voting  power of
         LSAT. In connection with this transaction, Liberty Media Group realized
         a $211 million gain (before  related tax expense of $84 million)  based
         on the difference between the cost basis and fair value of the economic
         interest in the Sprint PCS Group stock exchanged.

         Ascent Entertainment Group, Inc. ("Ascent")

         On March 28, 2000,  Liberty Media Group announced that it had completed

         of common stock of Ascent were  tendered in the offer and Liberty Media
         Group paid approximately  $385 million.  On June 8, 2000, Liberty Media
         Group completed its acquisition of 100% of Ascent for an additional $67
         million.  Such transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the $228
         million  excess of the  purchase  price  over the fair value of the net
         assets acquired is being amortized over 5 years.

         Liberty Livewire Corporation ("Liberty Livewire")

         On April 10, 2000,  Liberty Media Group acquired all of the outstanding
         common  stock of Four Media  Company  ("Four  Media") in  exchange  for
         approximately $123 million,  6.4 million shares of AT&T Class A Liberty
         Media  Group  common  stock and a  warrant  to  purchase  approximately
         700,000  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty  Media Group common stock at an
         exercise price of $23 per share. The acquisition was accounted for as a
         purchase.  In  connection  with the AT&T  Class A Liberty  Media  Group
         common stock issued in this transaction, Liberty Media Group recorded a
         $145 million  increase to combined  attributed  net assets and the $276
         million  excess of the  purchase  price  over the fair value of the net

         of  television  programming,  feature  films  and  other  entertainment
         products both domestically and internationally.

         On June 9, 2000, Liberty Media Group acquired a controlling interest in
         The Todd-AO  Corporation  ("Todd-AO"),  consisting of approximately 6.5
         million shares of Class B Common Stock of Todd-AO,  representing 60% of
         the  equity  and  approximately  94% of the  voting  power  of  Todd-AO
         outstanding   immediately  prior  to  the  closing,   in  exchange  for
         approximately  5.4 million  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty  Media Group
         common stock.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for as a purchase.  In
         connection  with the AT&T  Class A Liberty  Media  Group  common  stock
         issued in this transaction, Liberty Media Group recorded a $106 million
         increase to combined  attributed  net assets and the $96 million excess
         of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
         being  amortized  over 20  years.  Todd-AO  provides  sound,  video and
         ancillary  post  production  and  distribution  services  to the motion
         picture and television industries in the United States and Europe.

         Immediately  following the closing of such  transaction,  Liberty Media
         Group  contributed  to Todd-AO 100% of the capital stock of Four Media,
         in exchange for approximately 16.6 million shares of the Class B Common
         Stock of Todd-AO increasing Liberty Media Group's ownership interest in
         Todd-AO to approximately 84% of the equity and approximately 98% of the
         voting power of Todd-AO outstanding immediately following the closing.

         Following  Liberty  Media  Group's  acquisition  of  Todd-AO,  and  the
         contribution by Liberty Media Group to Todd-AO of Liberty Media Group's
         ownership in Four Media, Todd-AO changed its name to Liberty Livewire.

         On July 19,  2000,  Liberty  Media  Group  purchased  all of the assets
         relating to the post production, content and sound editorial businesses
         of  Soundelux   Entertainment  Group  ("Soundelux")  for  $90  million.
         Immediately  following such  transaction,  the assets of Soundelux were
         contributed  to Liberty  Livewire in  exchange  for  approximately  8.2
         million  additional  shares of Liberty  Livewire  Class B Common Stock.
         Following this contribution, Liberty Media Group's ownership in Liberty
         Livewire increased to approximately 88% of the equity and approximately

         1999

         TV Guide

         On March 1, 1999,  United Video Satellite Group, Inc. ("UVSG") and News
         Corp.  completed a  transaction  whereby UVSG  acquired News Corp.'s TV
         Guide properties and UVSG was renamed TV Guide. Upon completion of this
         transaction,  and another transaction completed by TV Guide on the same
         date,  Liberty Media Group owned an economic  interest of approximately
         44% and controlled  approximately  49% of the voting power of TV Guide.
         In connection with the increase in TV Guide's  equity,  net of dilution
         of Liberty Media Group's ownership interest in TV Guide,  Liberty Media
         Group  recognized a gain of $372  million  (before  deducting  deferred
         income taxes of $147 million).  Upon consummation,  Liberty Media Group
         began  accounting  for its interest in TV Guide under the equity method
         of accounting.

         1998

         Pramer S.A. ("Pramer")

         On August 24, 1998,  Liberty Media Group  purchased  100% of the issued
         and  outstanding  common  stock of  Pramer,  an  Argentine  programming
         company, for a total purchase price of $97 million, which was satisfied
         by $32 million in cash and the issuance of notes  payable in the amount
         of $65 million.  Such  transaction was accounted for under the purchase
         method.  Accordingly,  the  results of  operations  of Pramer have been
         consolidated  with those of Liberty  Media Group since August 24, 1998.
         The  $101  million  excess  cost  over  acquired  net  assets  is being
         amortized over ten years.

         Other

         During 1998, TCI acquired  certain  minority  interests of TV Guide and
         Liberty Media International,  Inc. (formerly named  Tele-Communications
         International,   Inc.).   The   transactions   were  accounted  for  as
         acquisitions of minority interests. The aggregate value assigned to the
         shares  issued by TCI was based  upon the  market  value of the  shares
         issued  at  the  time  each  transaction  was  announced.   Immediately
         following  the  transactions  TCI  contributed  the minority  interests
         acquired to Liberty Media Group. The contributions  were recorded as an
         increase to combined attributed net assets of $772.

         Senior Notes and Debentures

         On July 7, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  issued  $750  million of 7-7/8%
         Senior  Notes  due  2009 and  issued  $500  million  of  8-1/2%  Senior
         Debentures  due 2029 for  aggregate  cash  proceeds of $741 million and
         $494 million,  respectively.  Interest on both  issuances is payable on
         January 15 and July 15 of each year.

         On February 2, 2000,  Liberty  Media Group  issued $1 billion of 8-1/4%
         Senior Debentures due 2030 for aggregate cash proceeds of $983 million.
         Interest on these  debentures  is payable on February 1 and August 1 of
         each year.

         The  senior  notes  and  debentures  are  stated  net  of an  aggregate
         unamortized  discount of $22  million  and $15 million at December  31,
         2000 and  1999,  respectively,  which is being  amortized  to  interest
         expense in the combined statements of operations.

         Senior Exchangeable Debentures

         On November  16,  1999,  Liberty  Media Group issued $869 million of 4%
         Senior Exchangeable  Debentures due 2030 for aggregate cash proceeds of
         $854  million.  Interest  is payable on May 15 and  November 15 of each
         year. Each $1,000  debenture is exchangeable at the holder's option for
         the value of 22.9486 shares of Sprint PCS Group stock.  After the later
         of December 31, 2001 or the date Liberty Media Group's  ownership level
         in the Sprint PCS Group falls below a specified  level,  Liberty  Media
         Group may, at its election,  pay the exchange value in cash, Sprint PCS
         Group stock or a combination thereof.  Prior to such time, the exchange
         value must be paid in cash.

         On February 10, 2000, Liberty Media Group issued $750 million of 3-3/4%
         Senior Exchangeable  Debentures due 2030 for aggregate cash proceeds of
         $735 million.  On March 8, 2000,  an  additional  $60 million of 3-3/4%
         Senior  Exchangeable  Debentures  due 2030 were  issued  for  aggregate
         proceeds of $59 million.  Interest is payable on February 15 and August
         15 of each year. Each $1,000  debenture is exchangeable at the holder's
         option for the value of 16.7764 shares of Sprint PCS Group stock. After
         the  later of  February  15,  2002 or the date  Liberty  Media  Group's
         ownership level in the Sprint PCS Group falls below a specified  level,
         Liberty  Media Group may, at its  election,  pay the exchange  value in
         cash,  Sprint PCS Group stock or a combination  thereof.  Prior to such
         time, the exchange value must be paid in cash.

         The carrying amount of the senior  exchangeable  debentures is adjusted
         based on the fair  value of the  underlying  Sprint  PCS  Group  stock.
         Increases or decreases in the value of the underlying  Sprint PCS Group
         stock above the principal amount of the senior exchangeable  debentures
         (the  "Contingent  Portion") is recorded as an  adjustment  to interest
         expense in the combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive
         earnings.  If the  value  of the  underlying  Sprint  PCS  Group  stock
         decreases  below  the  principal  amount  of  the  senior  exchangeable
         debentures  there  is  no  effect  on  the  principal  amount  of  such
         debentures.

         Securities Lending Agreement

         On  January  7,  2000,  a trust,  which  holds  Liberty  Media  Group's
         investment in Sprint, entered into agreements to loan 18 million shares
         of Sprint PCS Group stock to a third party, as Agent. The obligation to
         return those shares is secured by cash collateral  equal to 100% of the
         market  value of that stock,  which was $338  million at  December  31,
         2000.  During the  period of the loan,  which is  terminable  by either
         party at any time, the cash collateral is to be marked-to-market daily.
         The trust,  for the benefit of Liberty Media Group,  has the use of 80%
         of the cash collateral plus any interest earned thereon during the term
         of the loan,  and is  required to pay a rebate fee equal to the federal
         funds rate less 30 basis points to the  borrower of the loaned  shares.
         Unutilized  cash  collateral  of  $49  million  at  December  31,  2000
         represents  restricted  cash and is included in other current assets on
         the combined balance sheets. At December 31, 2000,  Liberty Media Group
         had utilized $289 million of the cash  collateral  under the securities
         lending agreement.

         At  December  31,  2000,  Liberty  Media Group had  approximately  $270
         million in unused lines of credit under its bank credit facilities. The
         bank  credit  facilities  of  Liberty  Media  Group  generally  contain
         restrictive   covenants   which  require,   among  other  things,   the
         maintenance of certain  financial  ratios,  and include  limitations on
         indebtedness,   liens,   encumbrances,    acquisitions,   dispositions,
         guarantees  and dividends.  Liberty Media Group was in compliance  with
         its debt  covenants at December 31, 2000.  Additionally,  Liberty Media
         Group  pays fees  ranging  from .15% to .375% per annum on the  average
         unborrowed portions of the total amounts available for borrowings under
         bank credit facilities.

         The U.S.  dollar  equivalent of the annual  maturities of Liberty Media
         Group's  debt for each of the next  five  years are as  follows:  2001:
         $1,094  million;  2002: $28 million;  2003:  $132 million;  2004:  $270
         million and 2005: $347 million.

                                   (continued)

         Based on quoted market prices,  the fair value of Liberty Media Group's
         debt at December 31, 2000 is as follows (amounts in millions):

                 Senior notes of parent company                     $      737
                 Senior debentures of parent company                     1,384
                 Senior exchangeable debentures of parent
                   company                                               1,053
                 Senior notes of subsidiary                                184

         Liberty Media Group believes that the carrying  amount of the remainder
         of its debt approximated its fair value at December 31, 2000.

(9)      Income Taxes

         Subsequent  to the AT&T Merger,  Liberty Media Group is included in the
         consolidated  federal income tax return of AT&T and is a party to a tax
         sharing agreement with AT&T (the "AT&T Tax Sharing Agreement"). Liberty
         Media Group  calculates  its  respective  tax  liability  on a separate
         return  basis.  The income tax  provision  for  Liberty  Media Group is
         calculated  based on the  increase or decrease in the tax  liability of
         the AT&T consolidated group resulting from the inclusion of those items
         in the  consolidated  tax  return  of AT&T  which are  attributable  to
         Liberty Media Group.

         Under the AT&T Tax Sharing  Agreement,  Liberty Media Group  receives a
         cash payment from AT&T in periods when it generates  taxable losses and
         such  taxable  losses are  utilized by AT&T to reduce the  consolidated
         income tax liability.  This  utilization of taxable losses is accounted
         for by Liberty Media Group as a current federal intercompany income tax
         benefit.  To the extent  such  losses are not  utilized  by AT&T,  such
         amounts are available to reduce  federal  taxable  income  generated by
         Liberty Media Group in future periods,  similar to a net operating loss
         carryforward,  and are accounted for as a deferred  federal  income tax
         benefit.

         In periods when Liberty Media Group  generates  federal taxable income,
         AT&T has agreed to satisfy such tax  liability on Liberty Media Group's
         behalf up to a certain  amount.  The  reduction  of such  computed  tax
         liabilities will be accounted for by Liberty Media Group as an addition
         to combined  attributed net assets.  The total amount of future federal
         tax  liabilities  of Liberty  Media Group which AT&T will satisfy under
         the AT&T Tax Sharing  Agreement is  approximately  $830 million,  which
         represents  the tax  effect  of the  net  operating  loss  carryforward
         reflected  in TCI's final  federal  income tax  return,  subject to IRS
         adjustments.  Thereafter,  Liberty Media Group is required to make cash
         payments to AT&T for federal tax liabilities of Liberty Media Group.

         To the extent AT&T utilizes  existing net  operating  losses of Liberty
         Media Group,  such amounts will be accounted for by Liberty Media Group
         as a reduction of combined  attributed net assets. Net operating losses
         of  Liberty  Media  Group  with a tax  effected  carrying  value of $38
         million  and $88  million  were  recorded  as a  reduction  to combined
         attributed  net assets during the year ended  December 31, 2000 and the
         ten months ended December 31, 1999.

         Liberty Media Group will  generally  make cash payments to AT&T related
         to states where it generates  taxable  income and receive cash payments
         from AT&T in states where it generates taxable losses.

         Prior to the AT&T  Merger,  Liberty  Media Group was  included in TCI's
         consolidated  tax  return  and  was a  party  to the  TCI  tax  sharing
         agreements.

         Liberty  Media  Group's  obligation  under  the  1995  TCI Tax  Sharing
         Agreement of approximately $138 million (subject to adjustment),  which
         is included in "due to related  parties," shall be paid at the time, if
         ever, that Liberty Media Corporation  deconsolidates from AT&T. Liberty
         Media Group's  receivable  under the 1997 TCI Tax Sharing  Agreement of
         approximately  $220  million  was  forgiven  in the  AT&T  Tax  Sharing
         Agreement  and recorded as an  adjustment  to combined  attributed  net
         assets by Liberty Media Group in connection with the AT&T Merger.

         At December 31, 2000, Liberty Media Group had net operating and capital
         loss  carryforwards for income tax purposes  aggregating  approximately
         $800 million which,  if not utilized to reduce taxable income in future
         periods, will expire as follows:  2004: $63 million; 2005: $42 million;
         2006:  $14 million;  2007: $27 million;  2008:  $12 million;  2009: $23
         million;  2010: $34 million;  and beyond 2010: $585 million.  These net
         operating losses are subject to certain rules limiting their usage.

(10)     Combined Attributed Net Assets

         Stock Purchases

         During the year ended December 31, 2000, pursuant to a stock repurchase
         program,  14 million  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common
         stock were purchased at an aggregate cost of $269 million.  Such amount
         is  reflected  as a decrease to combined  attributed  net assets in the
         accompanying combined financial statements.

         During the year ended December 31, 1998, pursuant to a stock repurchase
         program,  Liberty Media Group  repurchased  .2 million  shares of TCI's
         then  outstanding  TCI Ventures  Group  tracking  stock and 1.5 million
         shares of TCI's then outstanding  Liberty Media Group tracking stock at
         an aggregate cost of approximately $30 million.

         Stock Issuances of Subsidiaries and Equity Affiliates

         Certain  consolidated  subsidiaries  and equity  affiliates  of Liberty
         Media  Group have  issued  shares of common  stock in  connection  with
         acquisitions and the exercise of employee stock options.  In connection
         with the  increase  in the  issuers'  equity,  net of the  dilution  of
         Liberty Media Group's ownership interest, that resulted from such stock
         issuances,   Liberty  Media  Group   recorded   increases  to  combined
         attributed net assets as follows (amounts in millions):

         Transactions with Officers and Directors

         In December  2000,  Liberty  Media Group  entered  into an agreement to
         guaranty  the  repayment  of a revolving  line of credit  extended by a
         financial  institution  to a director  of Liberty  Media  Group with an
         aggregate  available amount of up to $19.2 million. In consideration of
         this  guaranty,  the director has agreed to pay Liberty  Media Group an
         annual fee of $96,000, payable quarterly, for each year of the two year
         term of the line of credit.  To secure the director's  repayment of any
         amount paid by Liberty Media Group under the guaranty, the director has
         granted to Liberty Media Group a security  interest in all of his stock
         options  and  tandem or  free-standing  SARs with  respect to shares of
         AT&T's  Liberty Media Group  tracking stock and shares of AT&T's common
         stock. If the value of these securities fall below two times the amount
         of the loan  Liberty  Media  Group  has  guaranteed,  the  director  is
         required  to pledge  additional  collateral  to Liberty  Media Group of
         sufficient value to maintain the two-times coverage ratio.

         In November  2000,  Liberty Media Group  granted  certain  officers,  a
         director of Liberty  Media Group and a board member of a subsidiary  an
         aggregate  4.0725%  common stock  interest in a subsidiary  that owns a
         direct interest in Liberty Livewire.  The common stock interest granted
         to  these  individuals  had a  value  of  approximately  $400,000.  The
         subsidiary  also awarded the director of Liberty Media Group a deferred
         bonus in the initial total amount of approximately $3.4 million,  which
         amount  will  decrease  by an  amount  equal to any  increase  over the
         five-year  period from the date of the award in the value of certain of
         the common shares granted to the director.  Liberty Media Group and the
         individuals  entered  into  a  stockholders'  agreement  in  which  the
         individuals could require Liberty Media Group to repurchase, after five
         years,  all or part of their common stock interest in exchange for AT&T
         Class A Liberty Media Group common stock at its then fair market value.
         In  addition,  Liberty  Media  Group  has the right to  repurchase,  in
         exchange for AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common stock,  the common
         stock  interests  held by the  individuals  at fair market value at any
         time.

         In  October  2000,  Liberty  Media  Group  restructured  its  ownership
         interests in certain assets into a new consolidated subsidiary. Liberty
         Media Group then sold a preferred  interest in such  subsidiary  to the
         Chairman  of the  Board of  Directors  in  exchange  for  approximately
         540,000 shares of LSAT Series A common stock, approximately 3.3 million
         shares  of LSAT  Series  B  common  stock  and  cash  consideration  of
         approximately  $88 million.  No gain or loss was  recognized due to the
         related party nature of such transaction.

         In September 2000,  certain officers of Liberty Media Group purchased a
         6%  common  stock  interest  in a  subsidiary  for $1.3  million.  Such
         subsidiary owns an indirect interest in an entity that holds certain of
         Liberty Media Group's  investments in satellite and technology  related
         assets.   Liberty   Media  Group  and  the  officers   entered  into  a
         shareholders agreement in which the officers could require a subsidiary
         of Liberty  Media Group to purchase,  after five years,  all or part of
         their common stock  interest in exchange for AT&T Class A Liberty Media
         Group common stock at the then fair market value. In addition,  Liberty
         Media Group has the right to  purchase,  in  exchange  for AT&T Class A
         Liberty Media Group common stock,  the common stock  interests  held by
         the officers at fair market value at any time.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         In August 2000, a subsidiary of Liberty Media Group sold shares of such
         subsidiary's  Series A Convertible  Participating  Preferred Stock (the
         "Preferred  Shares") to a director of Liberty Media Group,  who is also
         the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of such subsidiary,  for a $21
         million note.  The Preferred  Shares are  convertible  into 1.4 million
         shares of the  subsidiary's  common  stock.  The note is secured by the
         Preferred  Shares or the proceeds  from the sale of such shares and the
         director's personal  obligations under such loan are limited. The note,
         which matures on August 1, 2005, may not be prepaid and interest on the
         note accrues at a rate of 7% per annum.

         In May 2000, an officer of Liberty Media Group,  certain  officers of a
         subsidiary  and another  individual  purchased an aggregate  20% common
         stock interest in a subsidiary for $800,000. This subsidiary owns a 10%
         interest in Jupiter  Telecommunications  Co., Inc.  Liberty Media Group
         and the individuals entered into a shareholders  agreement in which the
         individuals  could  require a  subsidiary  of  Liberty  Media  Group to
         purchase,  after five years, all or part of their common stock interest
         in exchange  for AT&T Class A Liberty  Media Group  common stock at its
         then fair market value. In addition,  Liberty Media Group has the right
         to purchase,  in exchange  for AT&T Class A Liberty  Media Group common
         stock,  the common stock  interests held by the officers at fair market
         value at any  time.  Liberty  Media  Group  recognized  $3  million  of
         compensation  expense  related to  changes  in the market  value of its
         contingent  liability to reacquire the common stock  interests  held by
         these officers during the year ended December 31, 2000.

         In connection with the AT&T Merger, Liberty Media Group paid two of its
         directors and one other individual, all three of whom were directors of
         TCI, an aggregate of $12 million for  services  rendered in  connection
         with the AT&T Merger.  Such amount is included in  operating,  selling,
         general and  administrative  expenses for the two months ended February
         28, 1999 in the  accompanying  combined  statements of  operations  and
         comprehensive earnings.

         Liberty  Media  Group  is  party  to  a  call  agreement  with  certain
         shareholders  of  AT&T  Class  B  Liberty  Media  Group  common  stock,
         including the Chairman of the Board of Directors,  which grants Liberty
         Media  Group a right to acquire  all of the AT&T Class B Liberty  Media
         Group common stock held by such shareholders in certain  circumstances.
         The price of acquiring  such shares is generally  limited to the market
         price of the AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group common stock,  plus a 10%
         premium.  Liberty  Media Group paid an aggregate  $140 million to these
         shareholders for the rights under the call agreement in February 1998.

         Transactions with AT&T and Other Related Parties

         Certain  subsidiaries of Liberty Media Group produce and/or  distribute
         programming  and  other  services  to  cable   distribution   operators
         (including   AT&T)  and  others  pursuant  to  long  term   affiliation
         agreements.  Charges to AT&T are based upon customary  rates charged to
         others.  Amounts included in revenue for services provided to AT&T were
         $243 million, $180 million, $43 million and $258 million for the twelve
         months  ended  December 31, 2000,  the ten months  ending  December 31,
         1999, the two month period ending  February 28, 1999 and the year ended
         December 31, 1998, respectively.

                                   (continued)
<PAGE>

         AT&T allocates certain corporate  general and  administrative  costs to
         Liberty Media Group  pursuant to an  intergroup  agreement for services
         provided.  Management  believes such allocation  methods are reasonable
         and  materially  approximate  the amount that Liberty Media Group would
         have  incurred  on  a  stand-alone   basis.  In  addition,   there  are
         arrangements  between  subsidiaries of Liberty Media Group and AT&T and
         its other subsidiaries for satellite  transponder  services,  marketing
         support,  programming,  and hosting services. These expenses aggregated
         $37 million,  $24 million,  $2 million and $28 million  during the year
         ended  December 31, 2000,  the ten months ended  December 31, 1999, the
         two months  ended  February  28, 1999 and the year ended  December  31,
         1998, respectively, and are included in operating, selling, general and

         On April 8, 1999,  Liberty Media Group redeemed all of its  outstanding
         4-1/2%  convertible  subordinated   debentures.   The  debentures  were
         convertible  into  shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media  Group Class A common
         stock at a  conversion  price of  $11.77,  or 84.96  shares  per $1,000
         principal amount. Certain holders of the debentures had exercised their
         rights to convert  their  debentures  and 29.2  million  shares of AT&T
         Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock were issued to such  holders.  In
         connection  with such  issuance of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  tracking
         stock,  Liberty Media Group recorded an increase to combined attributed
         net assets of $354 million.

         During  September  1998,  TCI assigned its  obligation  under an option
         contract  to  Liberty  Media  Group.  As a result  of such  assignment,
         Liberty   Media  Group   recorded  a  $16  million   reduction  to  the
         intercompany amount due to TCI and a corresponding increase to combined
         attributed net assets.

         Due to Related Parties

         The  amounts  included  in  "Due  to  related   parties"   represent  a
         non-interest  bearing  intercompany  account which includes  income tax
         allocations  that are to be  settled  at some  future  date.  All other
         amounts included in the  intercompany  account are to be settled within
         thirty days following notification.

(12)     Commitments and Contingencies

         Starz Encore Group,  a wholly owned  subsidiary of Liberty Media Group,
         provides premium  programming  distributed by cable,  direct satellite,
         TVRO and other distributors  throughout the United States. Starz Encore
         Group is obligated to pay fees for the rights to exhibit  certain films
         that  are  released  by  various  producers  through  2017  (the  "Film
         Licensing Obligations"). Based on customer levels at December 31, 2000,
         these  agreements  require minimum payments  aggregating  approximately
         $1.3 billion.  The aggregate  amount of the Film Licensing  Obligations
         under these license agreements is not currently  estimable because such
         amount is  dependent  upon the  number  of  qualifying  films  released
         theatrically  by certain motion picture studios as well as the domestic
         theatrical  exhibition  receipts  upon the  release of such  qualifying
         films.  Nevertheless,   required  aggregate  payments  under  the  Film
         Licensing Obligations could prove to be significant.

         Liberty  Media  Group has  guaranteed  various  loans,  notes  payable,
         letters of credit and other obligations (the "Guaranteed  Obligations")
         of certain affiliates. At December 31, 2000, the Guaranteed Obligations
         aggregated approximately $659 million.  Currently,  Liberty Media Group
         is not certain of the  likelihood  of being  required to perform  under
         such guarantees.

         Liberty  Media Group  leases  business  offices,  has entered into pole
         rental and  transponder  lease  agreements  and uses certain  equipment
         under  lease  arrangements.  Rental  expense  under  such  arrangements
         amounts to $50 million,  $30  million,  $18 million and $98 million for
         the year ended December 31, 2000, for the ten months ended December 31,
         1999,  the two  months  ended  February  28,  1999 and the  year  ended
         December 31, 1998, respectively.

         A  summary  of  future  minimum  lease  payments  under   noncancelable
         operating leases as of December 31, 2000 follows (amounts in millions):

                  Years ending December 31:

                        2001                              $      46
                        2002                                     41
                        2003                                     37
                        2004                                     32
                        2005                                     23
                        Thereafter                               61

         It is  expected  that in the normal  course of  business,  leases  that
         expire  generally  will be  renewed  or  replaced  by  leases  on other
         properties;   thus,  it  is  anticipated   that  future  minimum  lease
         commitments will not be less than the amount shown for 2000.

         Liberty  Media  Group  has  contingent  liabilities  related  to  legal
         proceedings  and  other  matters  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of
         business.  Although it is reasonably  possible  Liberty Media Group may
         incur losses upon  conclusion of such matters,  an estimate of any loss
         or range of loss cannot be made.  In the opinion of  management,  it is
         expected  that amounts,  if any,  which may be required to satisfy such
         contingencies  will not be material  in  relation  to the  accompanying
         combined financial statements.

         "Split Off Transaction").  Prior to the Split Off Transaction,  Liberty
         Media  Corporation  will increase its  authorized  capital  stock.  The
         Liberty Class A and Class B Common Stock will be reclassified as Series
         A Liberty Media Corporation common stock ("Series A common stock"), and
         the Class C Common Stock will be reclassified as Series B Liberty Media
         Corporation  common stock ("Series B common  stock").  In the Split Off
         Transaction,  each  share of Class A and  Class B Liberty  Media  Group
         Common  Stock  will be  exchanged  for a like  share of  Liberty  Media
         Corporation  Series A common stock and Liberty Media Corporation Series
         B  common  stock,  respectively.  Upon  completion  of  the  Split  Off
         Transaction,  Liberty Media  Corporation will no longer be a subsidiary
         of AT&T,  and no shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group tracking stock will
         be  outstanding.  The Split Off  Transaction  will be accounted  for at
         historical  cost.  There can be no assurance that the split off will be
         effected.

         Immediately prior to the Split Off Transaction, AT&T will contribute to
         Liberty Media Corporation  assets that are currently  attributed to the
         Liberty  Media  Group but not held by Liberty  Media  Corporation  (the
         "Contributed  Assets").  These  assets  include (i) a  preferred  stock
         interest and common stock warrants in ICG, a competitive local exchange
         telephone  company;  (ii) an approximate  34% common equity interest in
         Teligent,  a full service facilities based  communications  company and
         (iii) an  approximate  8% indirect  common  equity  interest in Liberty
         Digital,  Inc., a consolidated  subsidiary.  The contributions  will be
         accounted  for in a manner  similar  to a  pooling  of  interests  and,
         accordingly,  the financial statements of Liberty Media Corporation for
         periods  prior  to  contributions  will  be  restated  to  include  the
         financial  position and results of operations of the Contributed Assets
         once this transaction is completed.

         In connection with the Split Off Transaction, Liberty Media Corporation
         will also be deconsolidated  from AT&T for federal income tax purposes.
         As a result,  AT&T will be required to pay Liberty Media Corporation an
         amount  equal  to  35%  of  the  amount  of  the  net  operating   loss
         carryforward  reflected in TCI's final  federal  income tax return that
         has not been used as an offset to our obligations under the Tax Sharing
         Agreement and that has been, or is reasonably  expected to be, utilized
         by AT&T.  The payment  will be reduced by Liberty  Media  Corporation's
         obligation under the 1995 TCI Tax Sharing  Agreement.  The expected net
         payment from AT&T is approximately $692 million.  In addition,  certain
         deferred  intercompany  gains will be includible in taxable income as a
         result of the Split Off  Transaction and the resulting tax liability of
         approximately  $122  million  will be an  obligation  to Liberty  Media
         Corporation.
