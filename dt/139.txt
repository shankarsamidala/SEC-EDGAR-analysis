                    SAVINGS PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF
             BETHLEHEM STEEL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
             ----------------------------------------------------

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         -----------------------------

NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

         The Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of Bethlehem Steel Corporation
and Subsidiary Companies (the Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors of
Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem) effective as of March 1, 1975.  The
Plan has a trust (the Trust) under a Trust Agreement with State Street Bank and
Trust Company (the Trustee).  State Street is also the Plan's investment
manager.  The Employee Benefits Administration Committee, consisting of five or
more officers and employees of Bethlehem, is the administrator of the Plan.
Administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by Bethlehem.

         The Plan is a defined contribution plan and is subject to the
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
Under the terms of the Plan, an eligible salaried employee may elect to have up
to a maximum of 21% of eligible salary contributed as Before-Tax Contributions
and up to a maximum of from 10% to 14% of eligible salary as After-Tax
Contributions through payroll deductions, depending upon the length of
continuous service and the amount elected as Before-Tax Contributions.
Before-Tax and After-Tax Contributions are subject to a combined limit of 21%
of eligible salary.

         Before-Tax and After-Tax Contributions are treated as either Basic or
Supplemental Contributions depending on the participant's length of continuous
service and the amount elected as Before-Tax Contributions.  Basic
Contributions, which may range from 1% to a maximum of 4% of eligible salary,
are matched 100% by the Employing Company.  After-Tax Supplemental
Contributions are limited to 10% of eligible salary.  Participants should refer
to the Plan document for a complete description of the Plan provisions.


NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Accounting
- -------------------

         The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting.

                                  - 5 -








<PAGE> 6


Investments and Investment Income
- ---------------------------------

         Investments in Bethlehem Common Stock and equity and fixed income
securities are valued at fair value based upon the last published quotations
for the last business day of the year.  Mutual fund and common/collective trust
investments are valued at net asset value representing the value at which
shares of the fund may be purchased or redeemed.  Investments in contracts with
insurance companies are presented at contract value, representing contributions
made under the contracts, plus interest at the contract rate, less funds
withdrawn (see Note C).  Loans to participants are valued at cost which
approximates fair value.

         Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.  Dividends are recorded on
the ex-dividend date.

         Realized and unrealized gains and losses are determined on the basis
of beginning of the year fair value or, if acquired during the year, at
acquisition cost.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------

         Cash equivalents consist of investments in short-term, highly liquid
instruments with original maturities at the time of acquisition of three months
or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates fair value.

Withdrawals and Distributions
- -----------------------------

         Withdrawals and distributions to participants are recorded when paid.

Accounting Estimates
- --------------------
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and contingency disclosures at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of additions and
deductions during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these
estimates.


NOTE C - CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENT OPTIONS

         Contributions are paid by Bethlehem to the Trustee the week after they
were earned.  Before-Tax and After-Tax Employee Contributions are allocated
among the State Street Stable Fixed Income Fund, State Street S&P 500 Flagship
Fund, Fidelity Puritan Fund, Fidelity Magellan Fund and Bethlehem Stock Fund in
multiples of 1% at each participant's election.  Matching Company Contributions
are required to be initially invested in the Bethlehem Stock Fund.  After a

                                  - 6 -

<PAGE> 7


period of two full calendar years, these Matching Company Contributions can be
transferred to any of the other available investment funds.

         The State Street Stable Fixed Income Fund (the Fixed Income Fund) is a
fixed income fund consisting of investments in fully benefit responsive
guaranteed annuity contracts (GAC) and one immediate participation guarantee
contract.  The contracts are credited with interest at the rates specified in
the applicable contracts, which range from 5.52% to 14.40% and 5.17% to 9.75%
for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  The Fixed Income
Fund had an average yield of 6.77% for 1998 and 6.71% for 1997.  The Fixed
Income Fund had seven contracts at December 31, 1998 and five contracts at
December 31, 1997, representing 18.2% and 14.7% of the fund's net assets,
respectively, that had interest rate reset provisions.  These contracts were
credited with interest rates ranging from 5.90% to 14.40% and from 6.07% to
9.75% for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Interest
earned on investments in the Fixed Income Fund is reinvested in that fund.
There were no individual investments at December 31, 1998 and 1997 representing
5% or more of the Plan's net assets.  As discussed in Note B, the contracts are
included in the financial statements at contract value, which approximates fair
value, due to their fully benefit responsive nature.

         The State Street S&P 500 Flagship Fund is a diversified equity
investment fund; the Fidelity Puritan Fund is a growth and income mutual fund;
and the Fidelity Magellan Fund is an equity growth mutual fund.  Earnings on
investments are reinvested in the fund in which they are earned.

         Contributions to the Bethlehem Stock Fund are used to purchase shares
of Bethlehem Common Stock.  There were no dividends on Bethlehem Common Stock
for 1998 and 1997.  The Plan provides that shares of Bethlehem Common Stock may
be purchased by the Trustee on the open market or directly from Bethlehem.  The
Plan also permits, in lieu of cash contributions to the Trustee for the
purchase of shares of Bethlehem Common Stock, the transfer by Bethlehem of the
necessary number of shares of Bethlehem Common Stock directly to the Trustee.
During 1998 and 1997, Matching Company Contributions were made in shares of
Bethlehem Common Stock and all other contributions were made in cash.

         The Self-Managed Account (SMA) gives participants access to a wide
range of investments that include equity and fixed income securities and
approximately 1,500 mutual funds through State Street Brokerage Services, Inc.
Assets must be transferred from any or all of the other investment funds into
the SMA with an initial transfer of at least $2,500 and a $500 minimum transfer
thereafter.  The SMA balance cannot exceed 50% of the participant's total
account balance.  Assets invested in the Fixed Income Fund must be transferred
to any or all of the other core funds where they must remain for 90 days before
transfer to the SMA.

                                  - 7 -

NOTE D - LOAN PROVISION

         The Plan has a loan provision to permit an eligible participant to
borrow up to 50% of his vested account balance, subject to a minimum loan of
$1,000 and a maximum loan of $50,000.  Any participant with an account balance
of $2,000 or more is eligible for a loan.  A participant is permitted to have
up to two loans outstanding at one time.


         Participants may not borrow from the Bethlehem Stock Fund or the SMA.
The term of the loan is generally 12 to 57 months, but may be for a term of up
to 177 months under certain conditions.  Interest is fixed over the repayment
period at the prime rate as quoted by the Wall Street Journal on the last
business day of the month prior to the month in which the loan application is
approved, plus 1%.  Repayments of principal plus interest are made to the Loan
Fund and transferred to the other investment funds in accordance with
participants' current contribution investment elections.


NOTE E - WITHDRAWALS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

         Withdrawals from the funds may be made from time to time in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan.  However, voluntary withdrawal of the
Before-Tax or After-Tax Basic Contributions before the related Matching Company
Contributions have vested may result in forfeiture of the Matching Company
Contributions and earnings thereon.  The forfeitures reduce future Matching
Company Contributions.  For a participant employed on or before December 31,
1988, Matching Company Contributions for 1989 and later years vest immediately.
For a participant employed on or after January 1, 1989, Matching Company
Contributions will vest 100% after the participant completes five years of
service.  Withdrawals of Matching Company Contributions from the Bethlehem
Stock Fund may not be made until after the end of the second calendar year
following the year of contribution.

         Upon the termination of a participant's employment, the participant,
or in the event of a participant's death, his beneficiary, shall receive the
amounts in the investment funds allocated to his account.  In lieu of receiving
a lump-sum distribution, a participant or his beneficiary may elect to defer
payment to a later year or receive installment payments.

         At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Plan had a $462,590 and $23,198
obligation for withdrawals and distributions processed and approved, but not
yet paid to participants.  This obligation is reported as a liability for
Department of Labor Form 5500 reporting purposes, but not for purposes of these
financial statements.

NOTE G - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Plan invests in shares of funds managed by State Street.  State
Street acts as trustee for only those investments as defined by the Plan.
Transactions in such investments qualify as party-in-interest transactions
which are exempt from the prohibited transaction rules.

NOTE H - TAX STATUS

         Bethlehem has received determinations from the Internal Revenue
Service, the most recent of which is dated August 11, 1995, that the Trust
forming part of the Plan is a qualified trust within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and is exempt from Federal income tax under
Section 501(a) of such Code.  The Plan has been amended since receiving the
determination letter.  However, management believes the Plan is designed and
operating in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.

         Participants are not subject to Federal income tax on Before-Tax
Contributions, on Matching Company Contributions or on earnings credited to
their accounts until withdrawal or distribution of such amounts in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan.


NOTE I - TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

         Although it has not expressed an intention to do so, Bethlehem has the
right to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.  Upon
termination of the Plan or the complete discontinuance of Matching Company
Contributions, the amounts credited to participants' accounts will be fully
vested and nonforfeitable.


NOTE J - OTHER MATTERS

         The Plan's Fixed Income Fund held a Mutual Benefit Life Insurance
Company (MBL) GAC which was scheduled to mature on September 30, 1992, at a
contract rate of 8.0%.  On July 16, 1991, New Jersey's Department of Insurance
placed MBL under rehabilitation and placed a moratorium on withdrawals from all
GACs issued by MBL.  The Plan continued to accrue interest on this contract;
however, effective January 1, 1992, such accruals were reduced from 8.0% to
3.0% as an estimate of the actual interest rate to be determined in the
rehabilitation process.  On November 10, 1993, the Superior Court of New Jersey
approved the Plan of Rehabilitation for MBL.  This Rehabilitation Plan provided
contractholders with the option to Opt-In (participate in the Rehabilitation
Plan) or Opt-Out (receive a series of payments).  Effective March 28, 1994,
State Street, acting as Investment Manager for the Fixed Income Fund, elected
to Opt-In to the Plan of Rehabilitation.  Under this election, the MBL GAC was
restructured and issued as a Wrapped Accumulation Contract (WAC) whose assets
are invested in a separate account of MBL Life Assurance Corporation (MBLLAC),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBL.  A consortium of insurance companies is
guaranteeing the July 16, 1991, contract value and accrued interest through
December 31, 1991, valued at approximately $7.2 million for the Plan.
Additionally, the Rehabilitation Plan provides for interest on the MBLLAC WAC
at rates of 14.40% beginning November 1, 1998, 9.75% for July 1, 1997 through
October 31, 1997 and 6.35% for the first half of 1997.  Therefore, the
guaranteed value and accrued interest, as determined by the

Rehabilitation Plan, is $10.3 million at December 31, 1998.  Subsequent to
1994, interest rates are reset periodically until final maturity, but cannot go
below 0%.  On January 9, 1997, the Supreme Court of New Jersey approved a new
settlement agreement which provides for the restructured MBLLAC WAC to be paid
out on June 1, 1999.  Accordingly, no provision for loss has been accrued for
the MBL GAC, recorded at contract value, in the accompanying financial
statements.

                             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



To the Participants and Administrator of the
Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of
Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for
benefits of the Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of Bethlehem Steel
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the "Plan) at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the two years in the
period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules of assets
held for investment purposes and of reportable transactions are presented for
the purpose of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements but are supplementary information required by the
Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure Under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  These supplemental
schedules are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  The supplemental
schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.
