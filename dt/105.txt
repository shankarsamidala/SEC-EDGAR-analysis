1.The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
  generally  accepted  in  the  United States  for  interim  financial
  information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
  Regulation  S-X.   Accordingly, they  do  not  include  all  of  the
  information and footnotes required by generally accepted  accounting
  principles  for  complete financial statements.  In the  opinion  of
  management, these financial statements contain all known adjustments,
  consisting of normal recurring accruals, the impact of the September
  11, 2001 terrorist attacks referred to below, and asset impairment and
  other  charges  necessary to present fairly the financial  position,
  results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.  The
  results  of operations and cash flows for Sabre Holdings Corporation
  (Sabre)  have  been  reflected  as discontinued  operations  in  the
  consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September
  30, 2000.  Results of operations for the periods presented herein are
  not  indicative  of results of operations for the entire  year  (see
  discussion of the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
  in  footnote  2  below).   For  further information,  refer  to  the
  consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included  in
  the  AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K
  for  the  year ended December 31, 2000.  Certain amounts  have  been
  reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation. In this report, a
  reference  to  "American" or "American  Airlines"  is  to  American
  Airlines, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR).

  Among the effects experienced by the Company from the September  11,
  2001  terrorist  attacks  have  been significant  flight  disruption
  costs  caused by the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) imposed
  grounding  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry's  fleet,  significantly
  increased  security  and  other costs, significantly  higher  ticket
  refunds,  significantly  reduced  load  factors,  and  significantly
  reduced  yields. Further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft
  in  flight could result in another grounding of the Company's fleet,
  and  would likely result in additional reductions in load factor and
  yields,  along  with  increased ticket refund,  security  and  other
  costs.  In  addition,  terrorist attacks  not  involving  commercial
  aircraft,  or  the  general  increase  in  hostilities  relating  to
  reprisals  against  terrorist  organizations  or  otherwise,   could
  result  in decreased load factors and yields for airlines, including
  the Company, and increased costs.

  The  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  whether  any  additional
  provisions and/or revisions to the charges recorded as of  September
  30,  2001  (see  footnote 2 below) are required  during  the  fourth
  quarter  of  2001.   However, the impact of the September  11,  2001
  terrorist  attacks  on  the Company's financial  condition  and  the
  sufficiency  of its financial resources to absorb that  impact  will
  depend  on a number of factors.  For a discussion of these  factors,
  see  Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and
  Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.

2.On  September  11,  2001, two American  Airlines  aircraft  were
  hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center
  in New York City and the Pentagon in northern Virginia.  On the same
  day,  two United Air Lines aircraft were also hijacked and  used  in
  terrorist attacks.  In addition to the loss of all passengers and crew
  on  board the aircraft, these attacks resulted in untold deaths  and
  injuries  to persons on the ground and massive property damage.   In
  response to those terrorist attacks, the FAA issued a federal ground
  stop  order on September 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from,
  and within the United States.  Airports did not reopen until September
  13,  2001 (except for Washington Reagan National Airport, which  was
  partially  reopened on October 4, 2001).  The Company  was  able  to
  operate  only  a portion of its scheduled flights for  several  days
  thereafter.  When flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic
  and  yields  on the Company's flights were significantly lower  than
  prior  to the attacks.  As a result, the Company announced  that  it
  would reduce its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent of the
  schedule  it  flew  prior to September 11, 2001.  In  addition,  the
  Company also announced that, as a result of its schedule reduction and
  the sharp fall off in passenger traffic, it would eliminate at least
  20,000 jobs.  The Company's future schedule will vary as the Company
  reacts to continuing changes in demand and yields, as well as normal
  factors such as seasonality and fleet composition.

  On  September  22,  2001, President Bush signed  into  law  the  Air
  Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act),  which
  for  all  U.S.  airlines and air cargo carriers  (collectively,  air
  carriers),  provides  for, among other things:  (i)  $5  billion  in
  compensation  for  direct losses (including lost revenues)  incurred
  as  a  result  of the federal ground stop order and for  incremental
  losses incurred through December 31, 2001 as a direct result of  the
  attacks; (ii) subject to certain conditions, the availability of  up
  to  $10  billion in federal government guarantees of  certain  loans
  made  to  air carriers for which credit is not reasonably  available
  as   determined   by   a   newly  established   Air   Transportation
  Stabilization  Board;  (iii)  the  authority  of  the  Secretary  of
  Transportation  to  reimburse air carriers (which authority  expires
  180  days  after the enactment of the Act) for the increase  in  the
  cost  of insurance, for coverage ending before October 1, 2002, over
  the  premium in effect for the period September 4, 2001 to September
  10,   2001;   (iv)   at   the  discretion  of   the   Secretary   of
  Transportation,  a $100 million limit on the liability  of  any  air
  carrier   to  third  parties  with  respect  to  acts  of  terrorism
  committed  on  or  to  such air carrier during  the  180-day  period
  following  the enactment of the Act; (v) the extension  of  the  due
  date  for  the payment by air carriers of certain excise taxes;  and
  (vi)  compensation  to  individual  claimants  who  were  physically
  injured  or killed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September
  11,  2001.  In addition, the Act provides that, notwithstanding  any
  other   provision   of  law,  liability  for  all  claims,   whether
  compensatory or punitive, arising from the terrorist-related  events
  of  September 11, 2001 against any air carrier shall not exceed  the
  liability coverage maintained by the air carrier.

  The  Company  estimates that its liability from claims arising  from
  the  events  of  September 11, 2001 is approximately  $2.3  billion,
  after  considering  the liability protections provided  for  by  the
  Act.   The  Company  expects to recover the $2.3  billion  from  its
  insurance  carriers as claims are settled.  The insurance receivable
  and  liability  are  classified  as  Other  assets,  net  and  Other
  liabilities,   deferred   gains  and   deferred   credits   on   the
  accompanying  condensed consolidated balance  sheets,  respectively.
  The  Company  may revise  these  estimates as additional information
  becomes available concerning the expected claims.

  As  a  result  of  the September 11, 2001 events, aviation  insurers
  have  significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage
  available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other
  than  employees  or  passengers for claims resulting  from  acts  of
  terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage).  At  the  same
  time,  they  significantly increased the premiums for such  coverage
  as  well as for aviation insurance in general.  As detailed  above,
  the Act mitigated the  immediate  effects of changes in the aviation
  insurance market. In addition, and pursuant to the Act, the Government
  has issued war risk coverage to U.S. air carriers for renewable
  30-day periods.

  Under  the  Act, each air carrier is entitled to receive the  lesser
  of  (i)  its direct and incremental losses for the period  September
  11,  2001  to  December  31, 2001 or (ii) its  available  seat  mile
  allocation of the $5 billion compensation available under  the  Act.
  AMR  has  received a total of $452 million from the U.S.  Government
  under  the Act.  The Company expects to receive additional  payments
  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2001  aggregating  approximately  $452
  million.    As  of  September  30,  2001,  the  Company   recognized
  approximately $809 million as compensation under the Act,  which  is
  included  in  U.S. Government grant on the accompanying consolidated
  statements  of operations, and is based upon direct and  incremental
  losses  for the period September 11, 2001 through September 30,  2001,
  including special charges and lost revenue.

  Special  charges  for  the  three months ended  September  30,  2001
  includes the following (in millions):

   Provision for aircraft impairments and groundings  $  496
   Facility exit costs                                    61

  Provision for aircraft impairments and groundings

  Following  the events of September 11, 2001 and decisions  by  other
  carriers  to ground their Fokker 100 fleets, the Company  determined
  that  the  estimated fair market value of its Fokker 100,  Saab  340
  and  ATR 42 aircraft had further declined in value, on an other than
  temporary  basis,  as compared to the estimated fair  market  values
  used  to write-down the carrying value of these aircraft during  the
  second  quarter  of 2001 (see discussion below).  Therefore,  during
  the  third  quarter  of  2001, the Company  recorded  an  additional
  charge  of  approximately $423 million reflecting the diminution  in
  the  estimated  fair  market  value of these  aircraft  and  related
  rotables.

  Earlier this year, the Company determined that the estimated  future
  undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by its Fokker  100,
  Saab  340  and  ATR  42 aircraft fleets would  be  less  than  their
  carrying  amount and therefore, these aircraft were  impaired  under
  Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No.  121,  "Accounting
  for  the  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets
  to  Be  Disposed  Of" (SFAS 121).  As a result,  during  the  second
  quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge  of
  approximately  $685  million  relating  to  the  write-down  of  the
  carrying  value of 71 Fokker 100 aircraft, 74 Saab 340 aircraft  and
  20  ATR  42  aircraft and related rotables to their  estimated  fair
  market  values. Management estimated or determined the  undiscounted
  future  cash  flows utilizing models used by the Company  in  making
  fleet  and  scheduling decisions.  In determining  the  fair  market
  value  of these aircraft, the Company considered outside third party
  appraisals  and  recent  transactions  involving  sales  of  similar
  aircraft.

  As  a  result  of  the writedown of these aircraft  to  fair  market
  value,  as  well  as  the acceleration of the retirement  dates  and
  changes  in  salvage  values, depreciation and amortization  expense
  will decrease by approximately $55 million on an annualized basis.

  The  Company  also announced it would accelerate the  retirement  of
  its   remaining   50  owned  Boeing  727-200  aircraft   (previously
  scheduled  to  be retired by January 2003) to early  2002,
  ground all McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (DC9) aircraft by  the  end
  of  October 2001, and immediately ground eight McDonnell Douglas MD-
  80  (MD80) aircraft.  In conjunction therewith, the Company recorded
  a  charge  of approximately $73 million related primarily to  future
  lease  commitments  on  the DC9 and MD80 operating  leased  aircraft
  past  the dates they will be removed from service, lease return  and
  storage costs, and the write-down of one owned MD80 aircraft to  its
  estimated  fair  market value.  Cash outlays  are  estimated  to  be
  approximately  $64 million and will occur over the  remaining  lease
  terms, which extend through 2010.

  The   Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  its  current  operating
  schedule to determine if additional revisions to its fleet plan  are
  warranted,  which  will be primarily dependent on  passenger  demand
  and  yield  in  the  upcoming months.  In addition,  the  events  of
  September  11,  2001  and  the  resulting  significant  decline   in
  passenger traffic and yields require the Company to assess its long-
  lived  assets  for  impairment,  including  aircraft  fleets,  route
  acquisition  costs,  airport operating and gate  lease  rights,  and
  goodwill.   However, the Company is currently not  able  to  make  a
  reasonable  estimate of future cash flows derived from  these  long-
  lived  assets for the purposes of assessing whether such assets  are
  impaired  because of the lack of predictability of  future  traffic,
  business  mix  and  yields.   The Company  will  perform  impairment
  reviews  once this information becomes more predictable  and  future
  operating  cash  flows therefore become reasonably estimable.   This
  may  occur in the fourth quarter of 2001 or during 2002.   The  size
  of  any  resulting  charge  is not presently  known,  but  could  be
  significant.

  Facility exit costs

  Also  in  response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,  the
  Company  announced that it would discontinue service at Dallas  Love
  Field   and  discontinue  or  reduce  service  on  several  of   its
  international routes.  In addition, the Company announced  it  would
  close  six  Admiral's Clubs, five airport Platinum  Service  Centers
  and  approximately 105 off-airport Travel Centers in 37 cities,  all
  effective  September 28, 2001.  As a result of these  announcements,
  the  Company recorded a $61 million charge related to the  write-off
  of   leasehold  improvements,  fixed  assets  and  future  lease
  commitments.   Cash  outlays are estimated to be  approximately  $19
  million and will occur over the remaining lease terms, which  extend
  through 2017.

  Employee charges

  On  September  19,  2001, the Company announced  that  it  would  be
  forced  to  reduce its workforce by at least 20,000 jobs across  all
  work  groups  (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics,  fleet  service
  clerks,  agents,  management  and  support  staff  personnel).   The
  reduction  in  workforce, which the Company  expects  to  accomplish
  through  various measures, including leave of absences, job sharing,
  elimination   of  open  positions,  furloughs  in  accordance   with
  collective  bargaining agreements, and permanent  layoffs,  resulted
  from  the  September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks  and  the  Company's
  subsequent  reduction of its operating schedule by approximately  20
  percent  due to a sharp reduction in passenger traffic.  The Company
  recorded  an  employee  charge  of  approximately  $55  million  for
  termination  benefits  provided  to  the  employees  impacted.  Cash
  outlays   for   the   employee  charges  are   expected   to   occur
  substantially during the remainder of 2001 and will approximate  the
  amount of the charge recorded.

3.Accumulated  depreciation  of owned equipment  and  property  at
  September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, was $8.9 billion and  $8.3
  billion,  respectively.  Accumulated amortization of  equipment  and
  property under capital leases at September 30, 2001 and December 31,
  2000, was $1.2 billion.

4.As  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial  statements
  included  in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for  the  year
  ended  December 31, 2000, the Miami International Airport  Authority
  is  currently  investigating and remediating  various  environmental
  conditions  at  the  Miami International Airport (the  Airport)  and
  funding   the  remediation  costs  through  various  cost   recovery
  methods.   American  and AMR Eagle have been  named  as  potentially
  responsible  parties (PRPs) and contributors to  the  contamination.
  During  the  second  quarter of 2001, the Airport  filed  a  lawsuit
  against  17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover
  its  past  and future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County,  Florida  v.
  Advance  Cargo Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).
  In  addition  to the 17 defendants named in the lawsuit,  243  other
  agencies  and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors  to
  the  contamination.  American and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup
  costs  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  due  to  various  factors,
  including  the unknown extent of the remedial actions  that  may  be
  required,  the  proportion  of  the cost  that  will  ultimately  be
  recovered  from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding
  the  environmental  agencies  that  will  ultimately  supervise  the
  remedial activities and the nature of that supervision. In  addition,
  the  Company  is  subject to environmental issues at  various  other
  airport  and  non-airport  locations.   Management  believes,  after
  considering  a  number of factors, that the ultimate disposition  of
  these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect  the
  Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations  or
  cash flows.  Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based  on
  the  Company's  current  assessments of the  ultimate  outcome  and,
  accordingly,  could  increase  or  decrease  as  these   assessments
  change.

5.As of September 30, 2001, the Company had commitments to acquire
  the following aircraft: 49 Boeing 737-800s, 15 Boeing 767-300ERs, 15
  Boeing 757-200s, 10 Boeing 777-200ERs, 131 Embraer regional jets and
  25  Bombardier CRJ-700s.  Future payments for all aircraft, including
  the  estimated  amounts for price escalation, will approximate  $600
  million  during the remainder of 2001, $1.2 billion  in  2002,  $800
  million in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately $3.3 billion in 2004
  and beyond.  These cash flows reflect a tentative agreement the Company
  has with Boeing to defer 29 of its 45 2002 deliveries to 2004 and
  beyond. As the Company and Boeing are still negotiating the final
  terms of the tentative agreement, the  above aircraft commitment and
  cash flow amounts could change.

6.During  the  first  nine  months of 2001,  American  and  AMR  Eagle
  entered  into various debt agreements secured by aircraft  having  a
  net  book  value of approximately $1.7 billion.  Effective  interest
  rates  on  these  agreements are fixed or variable (based  on  LIBOR
  plus  a spread), ranging up to approximately 7.4 percent, and mature
  over various periods of time, ranging from 2013 to  2021. During the
  nine  months  ended  September 30, 2001, the  Company  had  borrowed
  approximately $1.7 billion under these agreements.

  American  has $1 billion in credit facility agreements  that  expire
  December  15,  2005,  subject to certain conditions.   In  September
  2001,  American borrowed approximately $819 million under the credit
  facility agreements which bears interest at 3.94 percent.

  During  the third quarter of 2001, American entered into an  advance
  payment facility which expires in 2004.  Interest is variable  based
  upon one month LIBOR plus a spread. As of September 30, 2001, the Company
  had  borrowed approximately $200 million under this advance payment
  facility. These borrowings bear interest ranging from 3 to 4 percent.

  In  April  2001,  the  Board of Directors of American  approved  the
  guarantee  by  American of AMR's existing debt obligations.   As  of
  September 30, 2001, American unconditionally guaranteed through  the
  life  of  the  related  obligations approximately  $695  million  of
  unsecured  debt,  approximately $700 million  of  secured  debt  and
  approximately $1.6 billion of special facility revenue bonds  issued
  by municipalities.

  Subsequent to September 30, 2001 and through October 24, 2001, the
  Company had issued approximately $1.3 billion  of enhanced
  equipment trust certificates, with $740 million received at  closing
  and  the remainder to be received as certain aircraft are delivered,
  with  interest  rates  ranging  from  6.978  to  8.608  percent  and
  maturing in 2011.  These borrowings are secured by aircraft.

7.On April 9, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the
  assets  of  Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA) for approximately $742
  million in cash  (subject to certain working capital adjustments) and
  assumed certain liabilities, including TWA's postretirement benefit
  other than pension liability.  The $742 million includes the $625
  million purchase price paid to TWA and various other acquisition costs,
  primarily the purchase of aircraft security deposits and prepaid rent.
  TWA was the eighth largest U.S. carrier, with a primary domestic hub in
  St. Louis. The Company funded the acquisition of TWA's assets with its
  existing cash and short-term investments.  The acquisition of TWA was
  accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
  the operating results of TWA since the date of acquisition  have  been
  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the
  three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001.

  The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  the
  preliminary  allocation of the purchase price, which  was  based  on
  estimated  fair  values  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities
  assumed,  and is subject to adjustments when additional  information
  concerning  asset  and  liability  valuations  are  finalized.   The
  preliminary excess purchase price over the estimated fair values  of
  the  net  assets  acquired resulted in goodwill in  excess  of  $900
  million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis  over  40
  years,  and  brought the Company's total goodwill  to  approximately
  $1.3  billion as of September 30, 2001.  However, effective  January
  1,  2002,  the Company will discontinue the amortization of goodwill
  in  accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.
  142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

</Table>
  For   the   three  and  nine  months  ended  September   30,   2001,
  approximately  12 million and 13 million dilutive potential  shares,
  respectively,  were not added to the denominator  because  inclusion
  of such shares would be antidilutive.

9.For  the  three and nine months ended September  30,  2001,  the
  Company  recognized net gains of approximately $15 million  and  $52
  million,  respectively,  as  a component  of  fuel  expense  on  the
  accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel
  hedging  agreements.  This compares to net gains recognized  by  the
  Company of approximately $159 million and $391 million, respectively,
  for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000.  (The amounts
  for 2001 and 2000 are not comparable in that the 2001 amounts reflect
  the  January  1, 2001 adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting
  Standards  No. 133 (SFAS 133); the 2000 amounts do not.)   The  fair
  value of the Company's fuel hedging agreements at September 30, 2001,
  representing  the amount the Company would receive to terminate  the
  agreements, totaled $93 million.

10.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
  sale securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
  the  fair  value  of certain derivative financial instruments  which
  qualify for hedge accounting in comprehensive income (loss).  For the
  three and nine months ended September 30, 2001, comprehensive loss was
  $511 million and $990 million, respectively.  The difference between
  net  loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended
  September 30, 2001 is due primarily to the cumulative effect of  the
  adoption  of  SFAS  133 and the on-going fair value  adjustments  of
  derivative  financial  instruments  under  SFAS  133,  net  of   the
  reclassification into earnings of the Company's derivative financial
  instruments.   The  difference between net income and  comprehensive
  income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000 was not
  material.

11.During  1999,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with
  priceline.com  Incorporated  (priceline)  whereby  ticket  inventory
  provided  by the Company may be sold through priceline's  e-commerce
  system.   In  conjunction with this agreement, the Company  received
  warrants  to purchase approximately 5.5 million shares of  priceline
  common stock.  In the second quarter of 2000, the Company sold these
  warrants for proceeds of approximately $94 million, and recorded a pre-
  tax gain of $57 million, which is included in Miscellaneous - net on
  the consolidated statements of operations.

12.During  the third quarter of 2000, AMR repurchased  prior  to
  scheduled maturity approximately $167 million in face value of long-
  term  debt.   Cash  from operations provided  the  funding  for  the
  repurchases.   These transactions resulted in an extraordinary  loss
  of $14 million.

13.Effective  after the close of business on March  15,  2000,  AMR
  distributed 0.722652 shares of Sabre Class A common stock  for  each
  share of AMR stock owned by AMR's shareholders.  The record date for
  the  dividend of Sabre stock was the close of business on  March  1,
  2000.  In addition, on February 18, 2000, Sabre paid a special  one-
  time cash dividend of $675 million to shareholders of record of Sabre
  common  stock at the close of business on February 15, 2000.   Based
  upon  its  approximate 83 percent interest in  Sabre,  AMR  received
  approximately $559 million of this dividend.  The dividend of  AMR's
  entire  ownership  interest in Sabre's common stock  resulted  in  a
  reduction to AMR's retained earnings in March of 2000 equal  to  the
  carrying value of the Company's investment in Sabre on March 15, 2000,
  which approximated $581 million.

  The  results  of  operations for Sabre have been  reflected  in  the
  consolidated  statements  of operations as discontinued  operations.
  Other  summarized  financial information of discontinued  operations
  for  the  nine  months ended September 30, 2000 is  as  follows  (in

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2001 and 2000

Summary AMR's net loss for the three months ended September 30,  2001
was  $414  million,  or $2.68 loss per share, as compared  to  income
before  extraordinary  loss  of $322  million,  or  $1.96  per  share
diluted, for the same period in 2000.  AMR's operating loss  for  the
third  quarter of 2001 was $558 million, compared to operating income
of  $572  million  for the third quarter of 2000.  On  September  11,
2001,  two  of  American's aircraft were hijacked  and  destroyed  in
terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and  the
Pentagon in northern Virginia.  On the same day, two United Air Lines
aircraft  were  also  hijacked and used  in  terrorist  attacks.   In
response   to   the   terrorist   attacks,   the   Federal   Aviation
Administration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop order on  September
11,  2001,  prohibiting all flights to, from, and within  the  United
States.  Airports did not reopen until September 13, 2001 (except for
Washington  Reagan National Airport, which was partially reopened  on
October 4, 2001).  The Company was able to operate only a portion  of
its  scheduled flights for several days thereafter. When flights were
permitted  to  resume, passenger traffic and yields on the  Company's
flights  were  significantly lower than prior to the attacks.   As  a
result,  the  Company  announced that it would reduce  its  operating
schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to
September  11,  2001.   For  additional information  related  to  the
September   11,  2001  events,  see  footnote  2  to  the   condensed
consolidated  financial  statements.  In addition,  as  discussed  in
footnote  7  to  the condensed consolidated financial statements,  on
April  9, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
and  assumed certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).
Accordingly, the operating results of TWA have been included  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements for  the  three-month
period  ended  September 30, 2001.  AMR's third quarter 2000  results
from  continuing operations include the effect of a labor  disruption
at  one  of the Company's major competitors which positively impacted
the  Company's net earnings by an estimated $0.22 to $0.28 per  share
diluted.

The Company's revenues decreased $440 million, or 8.4 percent, in the
third  quarter  of 2001 versus the same period last year.   Excluding
TWA's  revenues for the third quarter of 2001, the Company's revenues
would  have decreased by approximately $1.1 billion versus  the  same
period  last  year.  During the third quarter of 2001, the  Company's
revenues,  yield,  revenue passenger miles and available  seat  miles
were severely impacted by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a
worsening  of  the U.S. economy that had already been  dampening  the
demand for travel both domestically and internationally prior to  the
September  11, 2001 events, the reduced operating schedule,  business
travel restrictions imposed by numerous companies as a result of  the
September  11,  2001  attacks,  and  increased  fare  sale   activity
occurring  subsequent  to  the  September  11  attacks  to  encourage
passengers to resume flying.  The Company estimates the September 11,
2001  terrorist  attacks  to have negatively impacted  the  Company's
revenues by approximately $550 million to $650 million for the  three
months ended September 30, 2001.

American's  passenger  revenues decreased by 21.6  percent,  or  $950
million.  American's yield (the average amount one passenger pays  to
fly  one  mile) of 12.22 cents decreased by 12.1 percent compared  to
the same period in 2000.  Domestic yields decreased 15.9 percent from
the  third  quarter  of  2000.  International  yields  decreased  3.9
percent,  primarily due to a decrease of 9.0 percent and 6.2  percent
in  European and Pacific yields, respectively, partially offset by an
increase of approximately 1.6 percent in Latin American yields.

American's  traffic or revenue passenger miles (RPMs) decreased  10.8
percent  to  28.2 billion miles for the quarter ended  September  30,
2001.   American's capacity or available seat miles  (ASMs)  of  38.9
billion miles decreased 6.0 percent compared to the third quarter  of
2000.  As a result, American's load factor dropped 4 points year-over-
year.   American's  domestic  traffic decreased  11.7  percent  on  a
capacity   decrease  of  6.5  percent  while  international   traffic
decreased  9.1  percent  on  a  capacity  decrease  of  5.1  percent.
International activity included a 10.3 percent decrease in traffic to
Latin  America on a capacity decrease of 8.9 percent, a  9.4  percent
decrease  in traffic to Europe on a capacity decrease of 3.9 percent,
and  a  2.8 percent decrease in traffic to the Pacific on a  capacity
increase of 9.6 percent.

TWA's  passenger revenues were $591 million for the third quarter  of
2001.   TWA's  traffic  was 5.4 billion RPMs  while  capacity  was  8
billion ASMs.


                                    -13-

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

AMR  Eagle's  passenger  revenues  decreased  13.3  percent,  or  $52
million.   The decrease in passenger revenues resulted  from  a  10.0
percent  decrease  in passenger yield and a 3.6 percent  decrease  in
traffic.

Cargo  revenues decreased $25 million, or 13.7 percent, due primarily
to  the impact of the September 11, 2001  terrorist  attacks  and  the
softening of the U.S. economy.

The   Company's  operating  expenses  increased  14.7   percent,   or
approximately $690 million, and included approximately  $771  million
related  to TWA's operations for the third quarter 2001.  In addition
to  the specific explanations provided below, the significant decline
in  passenger traffic resulting from the terrorist acts of  September
11,  2001  caused  a  favorable impact on  certain  passenger-related
operating  expenses,  including  aircraft  fuel,  other  rentals  and
landing  fees,  commissions to agents and food  service.   American's
cost  per  ASM  increased 7.6 percent to 11.21 cents,  excluding  the
impact  of the third quarter 2001 special charges and U.S. Government
grant.   The increase in American's cost per ASM was driven partially
by  a  reduction  in ASMs due to the Company's More  Room  Throughout
Coach  program.  Adjusted for this program, American's cost  per  ASM
grew  approximately 5.8 percent, excluding the impact of the  special
charges  and  U.S.  Government grant.  Wages, salaries  and  benefits
increased  23.9 percent, or $412 million, and included  approximately
$313  million related to the addition of TWA.  The remaining increase
of  approximately $99 million related primarily to an increase in the
average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate  and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  Company's   labor
contracts.   During the third quarter of 2001, the  Company  recorded
approximately $100 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits
related to the Company's new or tentative labor contracts.  This  was
mostly  offset by a $98 million decrease in the provision for profit-
sharing  as  compared to the corresponding period in the prior  year.
Aircraft  fuel expense increased 19.8 percent, or $128  million,  and
included approximately $117 million related to the addition  of  TWA.
The  increase  in  aircraft fuel expense was due  to  a  5.3  percent
increase in the Company's average price per gallon and a 12.2 percent
increase   in   the  Company's  fuel  consumption,   including   TWA.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 19.9 percent, or  $61
million,  due  primarily  to the addition  of  new  aircraft  and  an
increase  of  approximately $30 million related to TWA.  Maintenance,
materials  and  repairs increased 19.4 percent, or $54  million,  and
included  approximately $38 million related to  TWA.   The  remaining
increase  was due primarily to an increase in engine volumes  at  the
Company's   maintenance  bases.   Other  rentals  and  landing   fees
increased $73 million, or 29.2 percent, primarily due to the addition
of  TWA.   Commissions  to  agents decreased  22.2  percent,  or  $59
million, and included approximately $17 million related to TWA.   The
decrease  was due primarily to a decrease of 8.6 percent in  combined
passenger   revenues  and  the  continued  benefit  from   commission
structure  changes  implemented in 2000.  Aircraft rentals  increased
$79  million, or 52.3 percent, due primarily to the addition  of  TWA
aircraft.   Other operating expense increased 13.3 percent,  or  $114
million,  due  primarily  to the addition of  TWA.   Special  charges
result  from  the  September 11, 2001 terrorist events  and  include
approximately  $496  million  related  to  aircraft  impairments  and
groundings,  $61  million  in facility exit  costs,  $55  million  in
employee charges, and approximately $20 million in other charges (see
footnote  2  to  the condensed consolidated financial statements  for
additional information relating to these charges).  The Company  will
continue  to  evaluate  whether  any  additional  provisions   and/or
revisions  to  the  charges recorded as of  September  30,  2001  are
required  during  the fourth quarter of 2001.  U.S. Government  grant
represents  the  reimbursement  for  direct  and  incremental   costs
resulting  from  the terrorist attacks, including impairment  charges
and lost revenues, recognized by the Company in the third quarter  of
2001   relating   to  the  Air  Transportation  Safety   and   System
Stabilization  Act  (see further discussion  in  footnote  2  to  the
condensed consolidated financial statements).

Other  income  (expense), historically a net expense,  increased  $31
million  due  primarily  to a decrease in interest  income  from  the
Company's lower investment balances during 2001.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2001 and 2000

Summary  AMR's net loss for the nine months ended September 30,  2001
was $964 million, or $6.26 loss per share.  This compares with income
from continuing operations before extraordinary loss of $732 million,
or  $4.55  per  share diluted, for the same period  in  2000.   AMR's
operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 was  $1.3
billion,  compared to operating income of $1.3 billion for  the  same
period  in  2000.  On September 11, 2001, two of American's  aircraft
were  hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World  Trade
Center  in  New York City and the Pentagon in northern Virginia.   On
the  same  day, two United Air Lines aircraft were also hijacked  and
used in terrorist attacks.  In response to the terrorist attacks, the
FAA  issued  a  federal  ground stop order  on  September  11,  2001,
prohibiting  all  flights  to, from, and within  the  United  States.
Airports  did  not  reopen  until  September  13,  2001  (except  for
Washington  Reagan National Airport, which was partially reopened  on
October 4, 2001).  The Company was able to operate only a portion  of
its scheduled flights for several days thereafter.  When flights were
permitted  to  resume, passenger traffic and yields on the  Company's
flights  were  significantly lower than prior to the attacks.   As  a
result,  the  Company  announced that it would reduce  its  operating
schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to
September  11,  2001.   On  April  9,  2001,  the  Company  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and assumed certain  liabilities  of
TWA.   Accordingly, the operating results of TWA since  the  date  of
acquisition  have  been  included in  the  accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements for the nine month period ended  September  30,
2001.   AMR's  third quarter 2000 results from continuing  operations
include  the  effect of a labor disruption at one  of  the  Company's
major  competitors  which  positively  impacted  the  Company's   net
earnings by an estimated $0.22 to $0.28 per share diluted.

The  Company's revenues increased approximately $315 million, or  2.1
percent, during the first nine months of 2001 versus the same  period
last  year.   However, excluding TWA's revenues for the period  April
10,  2001  through September 30, 2001, the Company's  revenues  would
have decreased approximately $1.1 billion versus the same period last
year. The Company's 2001 revenues, yield, revenue passenger miles and
available seat miles were severely impacted by the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the reduced operating schedule, a worsening of the
U.S.  economy that had already been dampening the demand  for  travel
both domestically and internationally prior to the September 11, 2001
events, business travel restrictions imposed by numerous companies as
a  result of the September 11, 2001 attacks, and increased fare  sale
activity  occurring  subsequent  to  the  September  11  attacks   to
encourage  passengers  to resume flying.  The Company  estimates  the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to have negatively impacted  the
Company's revenues by approximately $550 million to $650 million.

American's  passenger  revenues  decreased  by  8.1  percent,  or  $1
billion.   American's yield of 13.49 cents decreased by  2.7  percent
compared  to the same period in 2000.  Domestic yields decreased  3.9
percent  from  the  first nine months of 2000.  International  yields
increased 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase of 4.1 percent in Latin
American yields, mostly offset by a decrease of 7.0 percent  and  2.6
percent in Pacific and European yields, respectively.

American's  traffic  or RPMs decreased 5.5 percent  to  84.1  billion
miles  for  the  nine  months ended September 30,  2001.   American's
capacity or ASMs decreased 2.2 percent to 118.9 billion miles for the
first nine months of 2001.  American's domestic traffic decreased 6.8
percent  on  a  capacity decrease of 2.4 percent while  international
traffic  decreased 2.9 percent on capacity decreases of 1.6  percent.
International activity included a 6.7 percent increase in traffic  to
the  Pacific  on a capacity increase of 8.2 percent,  a  4.0  percent
decrease  in traffic to Europe on a capacity increase of 0.3 percent,
and  a 3.9 percent decrease in traffic to Latin America on a capacity
decrease of 5.2 percent.

TWA's  passenger  revenues were approximately $1.3  billion  for  the
period April 10, 2001 through September 30, 2001.  TWA's traffic  was
11.1 billion RPMs while capacity was 16 billion ASMs.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The   Company's  operating  expenses  increased  21.7   percent,   or
approximately $2.9 billion, and included approximately  $1.5  billion
related  to  TWA's operations for the period April 10,  2001  through
September 30, 2001. In addition to the specific explanations provided
below,  the  significant decline in passenger traffic resulting  from
the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 caused a favorable impact on
certain  passenger-related  operating  expenses,  including  aircraft
fuel, other rentals and landing fees, commissions to agents and  food
service.  American's  cost per ASM increased  8.7  percent  to  11.15
cents,  excluding  the impact of the second and  third  quarter  2001
special   charges  and  U.S.  Government  grant.   The  increase   in
American's cost per ASM was driven partially by a reduction  in  ASMs
due  to  the Company's More Room Throughout Coach program.   Adjusted
for  this  program,  American's cost per  ASM  grew  approximately  5
percent,  excluding  the  impact of  the  special  charges  and  U.S.
Government  grant.   Wages,  salaries  and  benefits  increased  19.8
percent,  or  $993 million, and included approximately  $600  million
related   to  the  addition  of  TWA.   The  remaining  increase   of
approximately  $393 million related primarily to an increase  in  the
average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate  and
seniority   increases  that  are  built  into  the  Company's   labor
contracts.   During  the nine months ended September  30,  2001,  the
Company  recorded  approximately $280 million  in  additional  wages,
salaries and benefits related to the Company's new or tentative labor
contracts.  This was mostly offset by a $270 million decrease in  the
provision for profit-sharing as compared to the corresponding  period
in  the prior year.  Aircraft fuel expense increased 31.5 percent, or
$557 million, and included approximately $237 million related to  the
addition of TWA.  The increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to  a
13.9 percent increase in the Company's average price per gallon and a
12 percent increase in the Company's fuel consumption, including TWA.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 16.2 percent, or $144
million,  due  primarily  to the addition  of  new  aircraft  and  an
increase  of  approximately $55 million related to TWA.  Maintenance,
materials  and  repairs increased $89 million, or 10.8  percent,  and
included  approximately $54 million related to  TWA.   The  remaining
increase  was due primarily to an increase in engine volumes  at  the
Company's   maintenance  bases.   Other  rentals  and  landing   fees
increased  $157 million, or 21.1 percent, and included  approximately
$97  million related to the addition of TWA.  The remaining  increase
of $60 million is due primarily to higher facilities rent and landing
fees  across American's system.  Commissions to agents decreased 13.2
percent,  or  $105  million, and included approximately  $48  million
related to TWA.  Despite an increase of approximately 1.9 percent  in
combined  passenger revenues, the Company benefited  from  commission
structure  changes  implemented in 2000.  Aircraft rentals  increased
$149  million, or 32.7 percent, due primarily to the addition of  TWA
aircraft.   Other operating expense increased 17.1 percent,  or  $422
million, and included approximately $264 million related to TWA.  The
remaining  increase  is  due  primarily to  increases  in  outsourced
services,  data processing, TWA integration expenses, and travel  and
incidental costs.  Special charges result from the September 11, 2001
terrorist  events  and the asset impairment charge  recorded  in  the
second  quarter  of  2001.  The September 11,  2001  special  charges
include  approximately $496 million related to  aircraft  impairments
and  groundings, $61 million in facility exit costs, $55  million  in
employee  charges,  and approximately $20 million in  other  charges.
During  the  second  quarter of 2001, the Company recorded  an  asset
impairment  charge of $685 million relating to the writedown  of  the
carrying  value  of  the Company's Fokker 100, Saab  340  and  ATR-42
aircraft and related rotables.  The Company will continue to evaluate
whether  any  additional provisions and/or revisions to  the  charges
recorded  as  of  September 30, 2001 are required during  the  fourth
quarter  of  2001  (see  further discussion  in  footnote  2  to  the
condensed consolidated financial statements).  U.S. Government  grant
represents  the  reimbursement  for  direct  and  incremental   costs
resulting  from  the terrorist attacks, including impairment  charges
and lost revenues, recognized by the Company in the third quarter  of
2001   relating   to  the  Air  Transportation  Safety   and   System
Stabilization  Act  (see further discussion  in  footnote  2  to  the
condensed consolidated financial statements).

Other  income  (expense), historically a net expense,  increased  $67
million due primarily to a decrease of $28 million in interest income
resulting from lower investment balances throughout most of the  year
and  a  decrease  of  $25 million in miscellaneous-net.   The  latter
reflects  the $57 million gain in the second quarter of 2000  on  the
sale  of  the  Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million  shares  of
priceline  common stock versus a $45 million gain during  the  second
quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to  the
Company's 1999 labor disruption, offset by the write-down of  certain
investments held by the Company during 2001.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net  cash  provided by operating activities in the nine month  period
ended   September  30,  2001  was  $1.3  billion,   a   decrease   of
approximately  $1.4  billion  over  the  same  period  in  2000,  due
primarily to a decrease in income from continuing operations from the
corresponding period in the prior year.  Capital expenditures for the
first  nine  months  of  2001  were $3.1 billion,  and  included  the
acquisition of 20 Boeing 737-800s, 10 Boeing 777-200ERs, eight Boeing
757-200s,  eight  Embraer 140s, seven Embraer 135s, six  Embraer  145
aircraft,  and  the purchase of 18 McDonnell Douglas  MD-80  aircraft
previously  leased by TWA.  These capital expenditures were  financed
primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements.  Four  Boeing
737-800  aircraft were financed through sale-leaseback  transactions.
On  April  9, 2001, the Company purchased substantially  all  of  the
assets and assumed certain liabilities of TWA for approximately  $742
million, which was funded from the Company's existing cash and short-
term  investments.   The  $742  million  includes  the  $625  million
purchase  price  paid  to  TWA and various other  acquisition  costs,
primarily  the  purchase of aircraft security  deposits  and  prepaid
rent.   Proceeds  from  the sale of equipment and  property  of  $326
million  included  the proceeds received upon the  delivery  of  four
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft to Federal Express.

                               -19-
<Page> 22
  As  of  September 30, 2001, the Company had commitments  to  acquire
the  following aircraft: 49 Boeing 737-800s, 15 Boeing 767-300ERs,  15
Boeing  757-200s, 10 Boeing 777-200ERs, 131 Embraer regional jets  and
25  Bombardier  CRJ-700s.  Future payments for all aircraft,  including
the  estimated  amounts  for price escalation, will  approximate  $600
million  during  the  remainder of 2001, $1.2 billion  in  2002,  $800
million in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately $3.3 billion in 2004
and beyond. These cash flows reflect a tentative  agreement the Company
has with Boeing to defer 29 of its 45 2002 deliveries to 2004 and beyond.
As the Company and Boeing are still negotiating the final terms of the
tentative agreement, the above aircraft commitment and cash flow amounts
could change.

  The  Company  has  available a variety of future financing  sources,
including, but not limited to: (i) the receipt of the remainder of the
U.S.   Government  grant,  which  approximates  $452   million,   (ii)
additional  secured  aircraft debt agreements, including the  issuance
of  approximately  $1.3  billion  of  enhanced equipment  trust
certificates, with $740 million received at closing and the  remainder
to  be  received  as  aircraft  are  delivered,  (iii)  sale-leaseback
transactions  of owned property, including aircraft and  real  estate,
(iv)  securitization  of  future  operating  receipts,  (v)  unsecured
borrowings, and (vi) federal loan guarantees as provided under the Act
and other types of secured debt agreements. No assurance can be given
that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company.

  As  of  September  30, 2001, the Company is in compliance with the two
financial covenants contained in the Company's credit facility agreements.
However,  it is likely that a significant  loss  in  the fourth  quarter
of  2001  could  cause the Company to violate one or both covenants,
unless they are modified. American is currently pursuing such modifications
to the agreements so that the Company will remain in compliance with the
covenants. Absent such modification, the $819 million currently outstanding
under the credit facility agreements could become due and payable in
late first quarter 2002.

  Subsequent  to  the  September 11, 2001 events,  Standard  &  Poor's
downgraded the senior unsecured credit rating of American from BBB- to
BB  and  Moody's  downgraded  the senior unsecured  credit  rating  of
American from Baa3 to Ba2.  The long-term corporate credit ratings  of
American  remain  on  Standard  &  Poor's  CreditWatch  with  negative
implications and Moody's has retained the credit ratings  of  American
on review for possible downgrade.

  The  impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their
aftermath  on  the  Company  and  the  sufficiency  of  its  financial
resources  to absorb that impact will depend on a number  of  factors,
including: (i) the magnitude and duration of the adverse impact of the
terrorist attacks on the economy in general, and the airline  industry
in  particular;  (ii)  the Company's ability to reduce  its  operating
costs  and  conserve its financial resources, taking into account  the
increased  costs  it  will  incur as a  consequence  of  the  attacks,
including  those referred to below; (iii) the higher costs  associated
with   new   airline  security  directives  and  any  other  increased
regulation  of  air carriers; (iv) the significantly higher  costs  of
aircraft insurance coverage for future claims caused by acts  of  war,
terrorism,  sabotage,  hijacking and other  similar  perils,  and  the
extent to which such insurance will continue to be available; (v)  the
Company's  ability to raise additional financing; (vi) the  price  and
availability of jet fuel, and the availability to the Company of  fuel
hedges  in  light of current industry conditions; (vii) the number  of
crew  members who may be called for duty in the reserve forces of  the
armed  services and the resulting impact on the Company's  ability  to
operate as planned; (viii) any resulting declines in the values of the
aircraft  in  the  Company's fleet and any  aircraft  or  other  asset
impairment   charge,  including  routes,  slots,   gates   and   other
intangibles; (ix) the extent of the benefits received by  the  Company
under   the   Act,   taking  into  account  any  challenges   to   and
interpretations  or  amendments  of  the  Act  or  regulations  issued
pursuant  thereto;  and  (x)  the  Company's  ability  to  retain  its
management and other employees in light of current industry conditions
and their impact on compensation and morale.

  At  this point, due in part to the lack of predictability of  future
traffic,  business  mix and yields, the Company  is  unable  to  fully
estimate  the  impact on it of the events of September  11,  2001  and
their  consequences and the sufficiency of its financial resources  to
absorb  that impact, including the mitigating effects of the  Act  and
the  Company's aggressive actions to reduce its costs.  However, given
the   magnitude  of  these  unprecedented  events  and  the   possible
subsequent effects, the Company expects that the adverse impact to the
Company's  financial  condition, its operations and  its prospects will
be material and could be highly material.

FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK

Capacity  for American and TWA combined will be down about 20  percent
from last year's levels.  Eagle capacity will be down about 5 percent.
Traffic  for  the  fourth quarter is challenging to  predict,  if  not
impossible.  As of October 22, 2001, advanced booking levels are down six
points in November and down four points in December, compared to the same
date and for the same periods last year. These numbers could  increase
however, as current trends show a higher than normal number of  booked
passengers not showing up for their flights.  Yields may decline  more
steeply in the fourth quarter than in the third, owing to more  -  and
deeper  -  fare sales and a weaker mix of business traffic.  AMR  unit
costs are expected to come in about two percent higher than last  year
-  at 11.8 cents - despite a 20 percent cut in capacity.  This is  due
in  large part to the numerous cost reduction initiatives the  Company
put  in  place  in  response to the September 11 terrorist  attacks  -
cutting  capacity  and  grounding aircraft, sharply  reducing  capital
spending,  closing facilities, trimming food service and reducing  its
workforce.  In addition, the Company expects to see lower fuel prices.
Somewhat offsetting these cost savings will be higher security  costs,
higher insurance premiums and greater interest expense.

Notwithstanding the cost savings initiatives, the Company is not  able
in  the  short term to reduce its costs commensurate with its capacity
(and  revenue).   As  a  result,  the  Company  expects  to  incur   a
significant loss in the fourth quarter, as well as for the  full  year
2001.

SPECIAL RISK FACTOR

Negative  Impact of Terrorist Attacks   Among the effects  experienced
by the Company from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have been
significant  flight  disruption  costs  caused  by  the  FAA's imposed
grounding   of   the  U.S.  airline  industry's  fleet,  significantly
increased  security  and  other  costs,  significantly  higher  ticket
refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced
yields. Further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft in  flight
could  result in another grounding of the Company's fleet,  and  would
likely  result  in significant reductions in load factor  and  yields,
along  with increased ticket refund, security and other  costs.  In
addition, terrorist attacks not involving commercial aircraft, or  the
general   increase  in  hostilities  relating  to  reprisals   against
terrorist  organizations or otherwise, could result in decreased  load
factors and yields for airlines, including the Company, and could also
result in increased costs.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In   July  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statements  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  141,  "Business
Combinations"  (SFAS 141) and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other  Intangible
Assets"  (SFAS  142).  SFAS 141 prohibits the use of  the  pooling-of-
interests  method for business combinations initiated after  June  30,
2001  and  includes criteria for the recognition of intangible  assets
separately from goodwill.  SFAS 142 includes the requirement  to  test
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  rather
than  amortize  them.  The Company will adopt SFAS 142  in  the  first
quarter   of   2002,   and  currently  estimates   discontinuing   the
amortization of approximately $62 million on an annualized basis.  The
Company  is  currently  evaluating what additional  impact  these  new
accounting  standards may have on the Company's financial position  or
results  of  operations.  However, with the decline in  the  Company's
market  capitalization,  in  part due  to  the  terrorist  attacks  on
September 11, 2001 the adoption of SFAS 142 might result in the write-
off or write-down of the Company's goodwill.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

Statements  in this report contain various forward-looking statements
within  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as
amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  represent  the  Company's  expectations  or  beliefs
concerning  future  events.   When used in  this  report,  the  words
"expects,"  "plans,"  "anticipates,"  and  similar  expressions   are
intended  to  identify  forward-looking statements.  Forward  looking
statements  include the Company's expectations concerning  operations
and  financial  conditions, overall economic  conditions,  plans  and
objectives  for future operations, and the impact of  the  events  of
September  11, 2001 on American and the sufficiency of the Company's
financial  resources  to  absorb that  impact.   All  forward-looking
statements in this report are based upon information available to the
Company  on  the  date  of this report.  The  Company  undertakes  no
obligation   to   publicly  update  or  revise  any   forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future  events  or
otherwise.   Forward-looking statements are subject to  a  number  of
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations.   These  factors include  the  adverse  impact  of  the
terrorist  attacks  on the economy in general, the  likelihood  of  a
further decline in air travel because of the attacks and as a  result
of a reduction in American's operations, higher costs associated with
new  security  directives and potentially new regulatory initiatives,
higher  costs  for insurance and the continued availability  of  such
insurance, the number of crew members who may be called for  duty  in
the armed services and the impact on American's ability to operate as
planned.   Additional information concerning these and other  factors
that  could  cause  actual  results to differ  is  contained  in  the
Company's  Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including  but
not limited to, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

There  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from  the
information   provided  in  Item  7A.  Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk of the Company's Annual Report on  Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, except as discussed below.

  Based on projected fuel usage for the next twelve months, including
the  Company's estimated fuel consumption for TWA, a hypothetical  10
percent  increase in the September 30, 2001 cost per gallon  of  fuel
would result in an increase in the Company's aircraft fuel expense of
approximately $170 million for the next twelve months,  net  of  fuel
hedge  instruments outstanding at September 30, 2001.  The change  in
market risk from December 31, 2000 is due primarily to the additional
fuel  consumption  of TWA, partially offset by  a  decrease  in  fuel
prices.   As  of  September  30, 2001,  the  Company,  including  the
estimated  fuel  consumption  of TWA,  has  hedged  approximately  58
percent  of its remaining 2001 fuel requirements, 38 percent  of  its
2002 fuel requirements, and 20 percent of its 2003 fuel requirements.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between  American
and  American Eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay moneys to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin American  from  enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus  treble  damages, attorneys' fees, and  costs.   American
intends  to  vigorously  defend  the lawsuit.   Although  the  Company
believes that the litigation is without merit, adverse court decisions
could  impose  restrictions  on  American's  ability  to  respond   to
competitors, and American's business may be adversely impacted.

   On May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division
of   the  Department  of  Justice)  sued  AMR  Corporation,  American
Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in
Wichita,   Kansas.  The  lawsuit  alleges  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) by increasing
service  when  new competitors began flying to DFW, and  by  matching
these  new  competitors' fares.  The Department of Justice  seeks  to
enjoin American from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and  to
impose  restraints on American to remedy the alleged effects  of  its
past  conduct.   On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court  for  the
District  of  Kansas granted American's motion for summary  judgment.
On  June  26,  2001,  the  U.S. Department of  Justice  appealed  the
granting  of  American's motion for summary judgment.  Following  the
events  of  September 11, 2001, AMR requested, and the  10th  Circuit
Court  of  Appeals  agreed, to defer the filing of all  briefs  until
2002.   No date has been set for oral argument.  American intends  to
defend the lawsuit vigorously.

   Between May 14, 1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits
were filed against  AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust  laws,  as  well as injunctive relief and  attorneys'  fees
(King v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric
v.  AMR  Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v.  AMR
Corp.,  et  al.;  Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl  v.  AMR
Corp.,  et  al.).  Collectively, these lawsuits allege that  American
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from DFW by increasing service when new  competitors
began  flying  to DFW, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
Two  of  the  suits  (Smith  and Wright) also  allege  that  American
unlawfully  monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline  passenger
service  to  and from DFW by offering discounted fares  to  corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain
conditions  on  the  use and availability of certain  fares,  and  by
offering override commissions to travel agents. The suits propose  to
certify  several classes of consumers, the broadest of which  is  all
persons who purchased tickets for air travel on American into or  out
of DFW since 1995 to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District
Court  stayed all of these actions pending developments in  the  case
brought by the Department of Justice.  As a result, to date no  class
has  been  certified.   American intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits
vigorously.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

   In  June 2001, the named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit, Hall
v.  United Airlines, et al., No. 7:00 CV 123-BR(1), sought  leave  to
file  an amended complaint that would substantially increase the size
and  scope  of the pending litigation.  The Hall case was  originally
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina against American and other airlines, and alleged  that
during  1999, American and the other defendant airlines conspired  to
reduce  commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in violation  of
Section  1 of the Sherman Act.  The proposed amended complaint  seeks
to  add  additional  named  plaintiffs and  defendants,  and  to  add
allegations that American and other airlines also conspired to reduce
commission rates from 10 percent to 8 percent in September  1997  and
to  cap  commissions  for international travel at  $50  each  way  in
October 1998.  Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is pending,  and
no  class  has yet been certified.  American is vigorously  defending
the lawsuit.

  The    Miami    International   Airport   Authority   is   currently
investigating and remediating various environmental conditions at  the
Miami  International Airport (the Airport) and funding the remediation
costs through various cost recovery methods.  American Airlines,  Inc.
and  AMR  Eagle  have  been named as potentially  responsible  parties
(PRPs)  and  contributors  to the contamination.   During  the  second
quarter  of  2001, the Airport filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,
including American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover  its  past
and  future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition  to
the  17  defendants  named  in the lawsuit,  243  other  agencies  and
companies   were   also  named  as  PRPs  and  contributors   to   the
contamination.  American and AMR Eagle's portion of the cleanup  costs
cannot  be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including  the
unknown  extent  of  the remedial actions that may  be  required,  the
proportion  of  the  cost that will ultimately be recovered  from  the
responsible  parties,  and uncertainties regarding  the  environmental
agencies  that  will ultimately supervise the remedial activities  and
the nature of that supervision. American is vigorously defending the
lawsuit.
