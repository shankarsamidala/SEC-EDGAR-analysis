AMR CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1.The   accompanying   unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles for interim financial  information  and  with
  the  instructions  to Form 10-Q and Article 10  of  Regulation  S-X.
  Accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and
  footnotes  required by generally accepted accounting principles  for
  complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management,  these
  financial  statements contain all adjustments, consisting of  normal
  recurring  accruals,  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial
  position,  results  of  operations and cash flows  for  the  periods
  indicated.  The  Company's  2002 results continue  to  be  adversely
  impacted  by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  In addition,
  on   April  9,  2001,  American  Airlines,  Inc.  (a  wholly   owned
  subsidiary  of AMR Corporation) purchased substantially all  of  the
  assets  and  assumed  certain liabilities of Trans  World  Airlines,
  Inc.  (TWA).  Accordingly, the operating results of TWA are included
  in  the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for
  the  three-month period ended March 31, 2002 but not for the  three-
  month  period  ended March 31, 2001.  When utilized in this  report,
  all    references   to   American   Airlines,   Inc.   include   TWA
  (collectively,  American).  Results of operations  for  the  periods
  presented  herein  are  not  necessarily indicative  of  results  of
  operations for the entire year.  For further information,  refer  to
  the   consolidated   financial  statements  and  footnotes   thereto
  included  in the AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) Annual  Report
  on  Form  10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 ("2001 Form  10-
  K").   Certain amounts from 2001 have been reclassified  to  conform
  with the 2002 presentation.

2.Accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at March 31,
  2002  and  December  31,  2001 was $8.9  billion.   Accumulated
  amortization of equipment and property under capital leases at March
  31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 was $1.2 billion.

3.The  following  table  provides  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated
  results  of operations, assuming the acquisition of TWA had occurred
  as of January 1, 2001 (in millions, except per share amounts):

                                  Three Months Ended
                                    March 31,2001

  Operating revenues                 $    5,542
  Net loss                                 (104)
  Loss per share                     $    (0.67)

  The  unaudited  pro  forma consolidated results of  operations  have
  been prepared for comparative purposes only.  These amounts are  not
  indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had  the
  transaction  actually been consummated on the date  indicated  above
  and  are  not  indicative of the consolidated results of  operations
  which may occur in the future.

4.As  discussed  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial
  statements included in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade County
  (the  County)  is  currently investigating and  remediating  various
  environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and
  funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various  cost
  recovery  methods.   American  and AMR  Eagle  have  been  named  as
  potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA.
  During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against
  17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past
  and future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
  Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to
  the  17  defendants  named in the lawsuit, 243  other  agencies  and
  companies  were  also  named  as  PRPs  and  contributors   to   the
  contamination.   American's and AMR Eagle's portion of  the  cleanup
  costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
  the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the
  proportion  of the cost that will ultimately be recovered  from  the
  responsible  parties, and uncertainties regarding the  environmental
  agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial activities  and
  the nature of that supervision.

  In addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at various
  other airport and non-airport locations. Management believes, after
  considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these
  environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the Company's
  consolidated  financial  position, results  of  operations  or  cash
  flows.   Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on  the
  Company's   current  assessments  of  the  ultimate   outcome   and,
  accordingly,  could  increase  or  decrease  as  these   assessments
  change.

5.As of March 31, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the
  following  aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 12 Boeing 777-200ERs,  nine
  Boeing 767-300ERs, one Boeing 757-200, 117 Embraer regional jets and
  22 Bombardier CRJ-700s.  Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to
  continue through 2008.  Payments for these aircraft are expected to be
  approximately $825 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.7 billion
  in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $1.9
  billion in 2005 through 2008.

6.During the three-month period ended March 31, 2002, American and
  AMR  Eagle  borrowed approximately $348 million under  various  debt
  agreements which are secured by aircraft.  Effective interest rates on
  these  agreements are based on London Interbank Offered Rate plus  a
  spread and mature over various periods of time with a final maturity
  in 2018.

  In  March 2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation issued
  facilities  sublease revenue bonds at the Los Angeles  International
  Airport  to  provide reimbursement to American for certain  facility
  construction  costs.   The  proceeds of approximately  $215  million
  provided  to  American have been recorded as long-term debt  on  the
  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets.   These  obligations  bear
  interest  at fixed rates, with an average rate of 7.88 percent,  and
  mature over various periods of time through 2024.

7.Effective  January  1,  2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement   of
  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for  Derivative
  Instruments  and Hedging Activities", as amended (SFAS  133).   SFAS
  133  required  the  Company  to recognize  all  derivatives  on  the
  balance  sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not  hedges  are
  adjusted  to  fair  value through income.  If the  derivative  is  a
  hedge,  depending on the nature of the hedge, changes  in  the  fair
  value  of derivatives are either offset against the change  in  fair
  value  of  the  hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or  firm  commitments
  through  earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  until
  the  hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion
  of  a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in
  earnings.   The adoption of SFAS 133 did not result in a  cumulative
  effect  adjustment being recorded to net income for  the  change  in
  accounting.   However, the Company recorded a transition  adjustment
  of  approximately  $64  million in Accumulated  other  comprehensive
  loss in the first quarter of 2001.

  In   addition,  effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted
  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill  and
  Other  Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires the Company
  to  test  goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (for  AMR,
  route  acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize  them.
  During  the  first  quarter  of  2002,  the  Company  completed  its
  impairment  analysis for route acquisition costs in accordance  with
  SFAS  142.   The  analysis did not result in an  impairment  charge.
  The  Company  will  complete the impairment analysis  for  its  $1.4
  billion of goodwill during the second quarter of 2002 and record  an
  impairment adjustment at that time, if necessary.

  The  following table provides information relating to the  Company's
  amortized  and  unamortized intangible assets as of March  31,  2002
  (in millions):

   Amortized intangible assets:
   Airport operating rights                $  516        $    163
   Gate lease rights                          209              75
   Total                                   $  725        $    238

   Unamortized intangible assets:
   Goodwill                                $1,401
   Route acquisition costs                    829
   Total                                   $2,230

  Airport  operating and gate lease rights are being  amortized  on  a
  straight-line basis over 25 years to a zero residual  value.    For
  the  three-month  period ended March 31, 2002, the Company  recorded
  amortization  expense of approximately $9 million related  to  these
  intangible   assets.    The  Company  expects   to   record   annual
  amortization  expense of approximately $29 million in  each  of  the
  next five years related to these intangible assets.

  The  pro forma effect of SFAS 142 - assuming the Company had adopted
  this  standard  as  of  January  1, 2001  -  is  immaterial  to  the
  Company's  net  loss  and loss per share for the three-month  period
  ended March 31, 2001.

8.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
  sale securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
  the  fair  value  of certain derivative financial  instruments  that
  qualify for hedge accounting in comprehensive income (loss).  For the
  three  months  ended  March 31, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive  income
  (loss)  was  $(500)  million  and $31  million,  respectively.   The
  difference  between net loss and comprehensive loss  for  the  three
  months ended March 31, 2002 is due primarily to the accounting for the
  Company's  derivative  financial instruments  under  SFAS  133.  The
  difference between net loss and comprehensive income for  the  three
  months ended March 31, 2001 was due primarily to the cumulative effect
  of  the  adoption of SFAS 133 and the accounting for  the  Company's
  derivative financial instruments under SFAS 133.

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2002 and 2001

Summary  AMR  Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss  during  the
first  quarter  of  2002  was $575 million, or  $3.71  per  share,  as
compared to a net loss of $43 million, or $0.28 per share for the same
period  in 2001.  AMR's operating loss of $729 million increased  $725
million  compared  to  the same period in 2001.   The  Company's  2002
results  continue to be adversely impacted by the September  11,  2001
terrorist  attacks.  In addition, on April 9, 2001, American Airlines,
Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of AMR) purchased substantially all of
the  assets  and assumed certain liabilities of Trans World  Airlines,
Inc. (TWA).  Accordingly, the operating results of TWA are included in
the  accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for  the
three-month  period ended March 31, 2002 but not for  the  three-month
period  ended  March  31, 2001.  All references to American  Airlines,
Inc. include TWA (collectively, American).

Although  traffic  has continued to increase on significantly  reduced
capacity  since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's  first
quarter  2002  revenues  were down significantly  year-over-year.   In
addition  to  the  residual  effects of September  11,  the  Company's
revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown
- --  seen largely in business travel declines -- and an increase in fare
sale  activity.   In  total,  the Company's  revenues  decreased  $624
million,  or 13.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2002 from the  same
period  last  year.  American's passenger revenues decreased  by  11.5
percent,  or $451 million in the first three months of 2002  from  the
same  period in 2001.  American's domestic revenue per available  seat
mile  (RASM)  decreased  15.4 percent, to 8.7  cents,  on  a  capacity
increase of 9.4 percent, to 29.3 billion available seat miles  (ASMs).
International  RASM  decreased to 8.66 cents, or 10.6  percent,  on  a
capacity decrease of 11.4 percent.  The decrease in international RASM
was  due  to  a  14.1  percent decrease and 11.9 percent  decrease  in
European and Latin American RASM, respectively, slightly offset by a 9
percent  increase  in  Pacific RASM.  The  decrease  in  international
capacity  was  driven by a 39.5 percent, 13.9 percent  and  4  percent
reduction in Pacific, European and Latin American ASMs, respectively.

AMR Eagle's passenger revenues decreased 13.8 percent, or $49 million.
AMR Eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent while capacity decreased 1.3
percent,  to  approximately 1.6 billion ASMs.  As with  American,  the
decrease  in  AMR Eagle's revenues was due primarily to the  continued
impact  of  the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the  economic
slowdown.

Cargo  revenues decreased $42 million, or 23.9 percent, for  the  same
reasons as noted above.

Other  revenues decreased 27.8 percent, or $82 million, due  primarily
to  decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs  for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel
service charges.

The  Company's  operating  expenses increased  2.1  percent,  or  $101
million.   American's  cost per ASM increased  0.4  percent  to  11.30
cents.   Wages, salaries and benefits increased 19.1 percent, or  $334
million,   primarily  due  to  contractual  wage  rate  and  seniority
increases  that  are  built into the Company's  labor  contracts.   In
addition, the Company experienced increases in its pension and  health
insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and
prescription  drug  costs.   Aircraft  fuel  expense  decreased   25.5
percent, or $180 million, due primarily to a 23.3 percent decrease  in
the  Company's  average price per gallon of fuel.  Other  rentals  and
landing  fees  increased 12.5 percent, or $32 million, due  to  higher
facilities  rent and landing fees across American's system.   Aircraft
rentals increased $78 million, or 52.7 percent, due primarily  to  the
addition  of  TWA  aircraft.  Commissions  to  agents  decreased  28.1
percent, or $63 million, due primarily to an  11.7 percent decrease in
passenger  revenues and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable
transactions.  Other operating expenses decreased 11 percent, or  $100
million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work  that
American  performs  for other airlines, and decreases  in  travel  and
incidental  costs, advertising and promotion costs,  and  credit  card
fees,  which  were partially offset by higher insurance  and  security
costs.


                                -8-

<Page> 11
Other  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $81
million due to the following: Interest income decreased 55 percent, or
$22  million, due primarily to decreases in interest rates.   Interest
expense  increased  $47 million, or 39.5 percent, resulting  primarily
from   the   increase  in  the  Company's  long-term  debt.   Interest
capitalized decreased $19 million, or 46.3 percent, due primarily to a
decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment.  Miscellaneous-net
decreased  46.7  percent,  or $7 million, due  to  the  write-down  of
certain  investments held by the Company during the first  quarter  of
2001.

The  effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2002  was
impacted by a $27 million charge resulting from a provision in Congress'
economic  stimulus package that changes the period for  carrybacks  of
net  operating losses (NOLs).  This change allows the Company to carry
back  2001  and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than two years  under
the  existing  law, allowing the Company to more quickly  recover  its
NOLs.   The  extended  NOL  carryback  did,  however,  result  in  the
displacement  of  foreign tax credits taken  in  prior  years.   These
credits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the
Company, resulting in this charge.

In addition, the following owned and leased aircraft were not operated
by  the  Company  as of March 31, 2002: 19 owned Boeing  727-200s,  15
operating  leased McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, 19 operating leased  Boeing
717-200s,  nine  owned  McDonnell Douglas  DC-10-10s,  four  operating
leased McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, three owned McDonnell Douglas MD-11s,
two  owned  McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s, and four owned,  six  capital
leased and two operating leased Saab 340Bs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash used for operating activities in the three-month period ended
March 31, 2002 was $406 million, an increase of $425 million over  the
same period in 2001, due primarily to an increase in the Company's net
loss.   Capital expenditures for the first three months of  2002  were
$619 million, and included the acquisition of six Boeing 757-200s, two
Boeing  777-200ERs,  seven  Embraer 140s and  two  Bombardier  CRJ-700
aircraft.  These capital expenditures were financed primarily  through
secured mortgage and debt agreements.

As  of  March  31, 2002, the Company had commitments  to  acquire  the
following  aircraft:  47 Boeing 737-800s, 12 Boeing  777-200ERs,  nine
Boeing  767-300ERs, one Boeing 757-200, 117 Embraer regional jets  and
22 Bombardier CRJ-700s.  Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to
continue through 2008.  Payments for these aircraft are expected to be
approximately $825 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.7  billion
in  2003, $1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately  $1.9
billion in 2005 through 2008.

OTHER INFORMATION

In  addition to the Company's approximately $2.3 billion in  cash  and
short-term investments as of March 31, 2002, the Company has available
a  variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to:
(i)  the  receipt  of  the  remainder of  the  U.S.  Government  grant
authorized  by  the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act  (the  Act), which is estimated to be in excess of  $100  million,
(ii)  additional secured aircraft debt, (iii) the availability of  the
Company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback transactions
of  owned  property,  including aircraft  and  real  estate,  (v)  the
recovery  of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision
in  the  recently  passed  economic  stimulus  package  regarding  NOL
carrybacks  (in  April 2002, the Company received  approximately  $393
million  related to the utilization of its remaining 2001  NOL),  (vi)
tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities, (vii) securitization  of
future  operating  receipts,  (viii) unsecured  borrowings,  and  (ix)
borrowings  backed  by federal loan guarantees as provided  under  the
Act.   No  assurance can be given that any of these financing  sources
will  be  available on terms acceptable to the Company.  However,  the
Company believes it will meet its current financing needs.

As  a  result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
significantly  reduced  the  maximum  amount  of  insurance   coverage
available  to  commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other
than  employees  or  passengers  for claims  resulting  from  acts  of
terrorism,  war or similar events (war-risk coverage).   At  the  same
time,  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage  as
well  as  for  aviation insurance in general.  Pursuant  to  authority
granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-
risk  insurance until May 19, 2002 with a third party liability policy
to  cover  losses  to persons other than employees or  passengers  for
renewable 60-day periods.  In the event the insurance carriers  reduce
further  the amount of insurance coverage available or the  Government
fails  to  renew  war-risk insurance, the Company's operations  and/or
financial  position,  results of operations or  cash  flows  would  be
adversely impacted.

As  discussed  in  the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, a  provision  in  the
current  Allied Pilots Association contract further limits the  number
of  ASMs and block hours flown by American's regional carrier partners
when  American  pilots  are on furlough.  As AMR  Eagle  continues  to
accept previously ordered regional jets, this will cause the ASM  cap
to  be  reached  sometime  in the first half  of  2002,  necessitating
actions  to  comply  with  that cap.  American  is  working  with  its
regional  partners  to  ensure that it  is  in  compliance  with  this
provision.  Actions currently being taken and considered by AMR  Eagle
to  reduce its capacity are discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K.
In  addition,  American  is  removing its code  from  flights  of  the
American  Connection  carriers, which are  independent  carriers  that
provide feed to American's St. Louis hub.  American believes that  the
combination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the ASM
cap through 2002 and for sometime beyond.

OUTLOOK

Capacity for American is expected to be down approximately 11  percent
in  the  second quarter of 2002 compared to last year's second quarter
levels.  AMR Eagle's second quarter capacity will be down about  three
percent from last year's levels.  For the second quarter of 2002,  the
Company  expects traffic to be lower by approximately  11  percent  as
compared  to  last year's second quarter levels.  Pressure  to  reduce
costs  will continue, although the Company will continue to see higher
wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs and insurance
premiums, and greater interest expense.  Although the Company  expects
to  see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of
2002,  fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second  quarter
of  2002  as compared to last year's second quarter prices.   Further,
the  Company expects to see a benefit in commission expense due to the
domestic base commission changes implemented in March 2002.  In  total
however,  American's  unit costs for the second quarter  of  2002  are
expected  to  be two to three percent higher than last  year's  second
quarter.   Given  this  higher unit cost,  coupled  with  the  revenue
pressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into  the
second  quarter,  the Company expects to incur a loss  in  the  second
quarter (although the Company does not expect this loss to be of the
same magnitude as the Company's first quarter loss), and will likely
incur a loss for 2002.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between  American
and  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay monies to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   The  plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The  Company
intends  to  vigorously  defend  the lawsuit.   Although  the  Company
believes that the litigation is without merit, an adverse court decision
could  impose  restrictions on the Company's relationships with travel
agencies which restrictions could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of
the  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,
Inc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,
Kansas.  The  lawsuit alleges that American unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
Dallas/Fort  Worth  International Airport (DFW) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching these  new
competitors'  fares.   The  Department  of  Justice  seeks  to  enjoin
American  from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to  impose
restraints  on  American to remedy the alleged  effects  of  its  past
conduct.   On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Kansas granted American's motion for summary judgment.  On June 26,
2001,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  appealed  the  granting  of
American's  motion for summary judgment.  The parties  have  submitted
briefs to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.  No date has been set for
oral  argument.  The Company intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.
A  final adverse court decision imposing restrictions on the Company's
ability to respond to competitors would have an adverse impact on  the
Company.

Between  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits
were  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (King
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR
Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et
al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).
Collectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying
to  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors' fares.   Two  of  the
suits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from
1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
Department  of  Justice.   As a result, to  date  no  class  has  been
certified.   The Company intends to defend these lawsuits  vigorously.
One or more final adverse court decisions imposing restrictions on the
Company's  ability  to respond to competitors or awarding  substantial
money damages would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  January 30, 2002, the named plaintiff in Hall v. United  Airlines,
et  al.,  No. 7:00 CV 123-BR(1), pending in the United States District
Court  for  the Eastern District of North Carolina, filed  an  amended
complaint alleging that between 1997 and the present, American and the
other defendant airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-
based travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The
named  plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of travel agents,
but no class has yet been certified.  American is vigorously defending
the  lawsuit.   A  final  adverse court decision awarding  substantial
money damages would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

Miami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and
remediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami
International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through
landing  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,
Inc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties
(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of
2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future
cleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,
Inc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17
defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were
also  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American's
and  AMR  Eagle's  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably
estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that
will  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and
uncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will
ultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that
supervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.
