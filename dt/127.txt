NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ANACOMP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. 	During interim periods, Anacomp follows the accounting policies set
    forth in its Annual Report to Stockholders and its Report on Form 10-K
    filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Users of financial
    information produced for interim periods are encouraged to refer to the
    footnotes contained in the Annual Report to Stockholders when reviewing
    interim financial results.

    In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial
    statements contain all material adjustments, consisting only of normal
    recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated
    financial condition, results of operations, and changes in financial
    position and stockholders' equity of Anacomp and its subsidiaries for
    interim periods.  Certain amounts in the prior period financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period
    presentation.

2.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
    determined by methods approximating the first-in, first-out basis.

    The cost of inventories is distributed as follows:

3.  In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
    (FAS 109).  Under FAS 109, the Company recognizes income taxes under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The liability method
    measures the expected tax impact of future taxable income or deductions
    resulting from differences in the tax and financial reporting bases of
    assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and the
    expected tax impact of carryforwards for tax purposes.  A valuation
    allowance is to be recorded against those tax assets when it is "more
    likely than not" that the benefit will not be realized.

    FAS 109 was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 1994.  The Company
    recorded a deferred tax asset of $95 million representing the tax effect of
    federal and state tax NOLs and tax credits.  The Company also recorded a
    valuation allowance of $60 million reducing the deferred tax asset to a net
    $35 million.

    Recognition of the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance at October 1,
    1993 caused adjustments to the following financial statement components:

                                                 Capital    Accrued

    In the future, the federal provision for income taxes reflected in the
    consolidated statement of operations will generally not require a cash
    payout to the extent the Company has NOLs.  The cash savings from the
    utilization of NOLs will be reported as a reduction of the net deferred tax
    asset recorded under the guidelines of FAS 109; thereafter, as a reduction
    of goodwill.

    The provision for income taxes for the six months ended March 31, 1994 and
    1993 consisted of the following:

    At March 31, 1994 the Company had NOLs of approximately $219 million
    available to offset future taxable income.  An additional $31 million is
    available in future periods as accrued expenses become deductible.  The
    Company also has tax credit carryforwards of $3 million available to reduce
    future tax liabilities, including $1 million of preacquisition tax credits.
    The NOLs expire commencing in 1995 ($15 million) with remaining amounts in
    various periods through 2007.  The tax credit carryforwards expire
    substantially in 1997.

    In addition to the cumulative effect adjustment on the statement of
    operations, the adoption of FAS 109 reduced goodwill amortization expense
    by  $193,000 and $387,000 during the three-month and six-month periods
    ended March 31, 1994, respectively.  Accordingly, income from continuing
    operations and net income increased by $91,000 and $182,000, respectively.
    There was no effect on earnings per common and common equivalent share.

    If FAS 109 had been adopted beginning October 1, 1992, the following
    proforma results would have been reported for the periods ended (In
    thousands except per share amounts):

    Earnings per common and common
      equivalent share..................	   .01	   .03	   .04	    .39
</TABLE>

4. The computation of earnings per common and common equivalent share is based
    upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period plus (in periods in which they have a dilutive effect) the effect of
    common shares contingently issuable, primarily from stock options and
    exercise of warrants.

    The fully diluted per share computation reflects the effect of common
    shares contingently issuable upon the exercise of warrants in periods in
    which such exercise would cause dilution.  Fully diluted earnings per share
    also reflect additional dilution related to stock options due to the use of
    the market price at the end of the period, when higher than the average
    price for the period.

    Fully diluted earnings per share are the same as primary earnings per share
    for the periods presented.

5. Effective January 3, 1994, the Company purchased the Com Services customer
   base of 14 micrographics service centers operated by National Business
   Systems for $14.8 million using equal amounts of common stock and cash.
   This business has been or will be merged into Anacomp's existing service
   centers.

6. Effective May 4, 1994, the Company purchased Graham Acquisition Corporation
   ("Graham") for $7.6 million of Anacomp stock.  The agreement also provides
   for contingent consideration of up to $7.6 million of Anacomp stock based
   upon the future earnings of Graham.  Graham manufacturers and distributes
   3480 computer tape cartridges and open reel tape.  Graham's operations will
   be combined with Anacomp's existing magnetic media products division.


<PAGE> 10
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Results of Operations

Total revenues for the six months ended March 31, 1994 were essentially level
with the same period of the prior year.  Micrographics service revenues
however, were up $4.4 million, or, 7%, largely as a result of the acquisition
of 14 data centers from National Business Systems which was effective January
3, 1994.  Maintenance service revenues were up 3% and magnetic media sales were
up 4%.  COM system sales and supply sales were down 2% and 9%, respectively,
due primarily to decreased shipments in the OEM channel.

Service revenues generated a gross profit margin of 31% for the six months,
down from 32% in the same period of the prior year.  The decline is due to
transition expenses incurred in assimilating the data center customers acquired
from NBS.  Equipment and supply sales generated a gross profit margin of 29%
compared to 30% in the prior year.  The reduced margin results largely from
reduced COM system and reader printer shipments and the resulting impact on
manufacturing costs.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 16% of total revenues
for both years.

The financial statements reflect the Company's adoption of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", as
discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The March 31,
1994 Balance Sheet includes a $34 million deferred tax asset and the
Consolidated Statements of Operations include a $8 million one time adjustment
reflecting the cumulative effect on prior years of this accounting change.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital amounted to $17.4 million at March 31, 1994 compared to $30.9
million at September 30, 1993.  The decrease is mainly due to improved
inventory turnover ratios.  As disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, net cash provided by operating activities improved $1.5 in the first six
months of fiscal year 1994 compared to the first six months of fiscal 1993.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $6.0 million because of the
acquisition of data centers from National Business Systems.  Net cash used in
financing activities was reduced $25.2 million reflecting lower paydowns on the
Company's revolving line of credit and contributing to the year to year
increase in cash balances of $15.9 million.  The Company believes that
operating cash flow in 1994 will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for
capital expenditures, debt repayments, and other obligations.
