Act of 1934, as amended, for each of American Pad & Paper Company, a Delaware
corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, American Pad & Paper Company of

references herein to the "Company" refer to both American Pad & Paper Company

has no operations other than those of American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware,
Inc. and its subsidiaries and (ii) all assets and liabilities of American Pad &

Company and American Pad & Paper of Delaware, Inc.

1.       ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         Organization and Basis of Presentation

         American Pad & Paper Company (the "Company") is a holding company
which conducts its operations through American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware,
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

         The financial statements of the Company present the accounts and
operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Notepad Funding
Corporation, a special purpose corporation utilized in the accounts receivable
facility. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated. Certain
prior and current year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.

         Business

         The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
paper-based office products in North America. The Company operates in one
business segment, converting paper into office products, and offers a broad
assortment of products through two complementary divisions: Ampad (writing
pads, file folders, retail envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based
office products) and Williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). The
Company's products are distributed through large mass merchant retailers,
office product superstores, warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office
products wholesalers, paper merchants, and independent dealers. Substantially
all sales are to customers within the United States.

         Interim Financial Information

         The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited. Certain
information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted, although the Company believes the disclosures included herein are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1996.

         The accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of the Company's financial position at September 30, 1997, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the nine and three month
periods ended September 30, 1997 and 1996. The results of operations for the
interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be
expected for the full fiscal year.

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION - SHADE/ALLIED, INC.

         Effective February 11, 1997, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of Shade/Allied, Inc., ("Shade/Allied")
for approximately $50,668, consisting of $49,477 in cash and $1,191 in direct
acquisition costs, financed by the Company's bank credit agreement. This
acquisition has been recorded following the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets
and liabilities at their fair market values. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill
and amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. The Company preliminarily
allocated the purchase price as follows: trade accounts receivable of $4,585,
inventories of $5,760, other current assets of $856, property, plant and
equipment of $14,825, identifiable intangible assets of $5,610, deferred income
tax liability of $7,316, current liabilities of $13,957, noncurrent liabilities
of $1,145 and goodwill of $41,450. The operating results of Shade/Allied have
been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
since the date of acquisition.

8.       EARNINGS PER SHARE

         Effective December 15, 1997, the Company will report basic and diluted
earnings per share following the guidance provided in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Number 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share
will be computed as the quotient of net income divided by the actual number of
outstanding shares of common stock at the end of a period. Diluted earnings per
share will be computed as the quotient of net income divided by the number of
outstanding shares of common stock as adjusted for common stock options. The
adjustment for common stock options will be calculated by assuming that all
dilutive options are exercised, that the proceeds from such exercise are used
to repurchase shares of the Company's stock at the average price of the common
stock during the period and that the Company will also generate proceeds and
repurchase shares from the tax benefits associated with the assumed exercise of
the common stock options. Early adoption of this new accounting standard is not
permitted nor is the Company permitted to present the earnings per share
information calculated following this guidance on the face of the Company's
statement of operations.

</TABLE>


         The Company intends to adopt the new accounting standard effective
December 31, 1997 and will present the basic and diluted earnings per share
information as part of the quarterly financial data in the Company's annual
report to shareholders.

         Given the changes in the Company's capital structure effected in
connection with the initial public offering of the Company's common stock,
historical earnings per share for 1996 are not presented in the condensed
consolidated statement of income as it is not considered to be meaningful. Pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding reflect conversion of the preferred
stock into common stock for the same periods outstanding as the underlying
common stock on which the preferred stock was issued and the initial public
offering of common stock.

         The pro forma weighted average shares outstanding gives effect to the
8.1192-for-one stock split and has been adjusted to reflect as outstanding,
using the treasury stock method at the estimated initial public offering price,
all shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options granted subsequent to
April 25, 1995 (one year prior to the initial public offering filing date
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules).

9.       CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY

         The 13% senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by Shade/Allied,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware,
Inc. ("Delaware"). The subsidiary guaranty is full, unconditional and joint and
several. The Company is not a guarantor of the senior subordinated notes.
Separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiary are not presented
because management has determined that they would not be material to investors.
However, condensed consolidating financial information as of September 30, 1997
and for the three and nine months then ended is presented. Shade/Allied was
acquired by Delaware on February 11, 1997 and, as a result, the nine month
period ended September 30, 1997 is the first period in which the Company's
historical results include the results of operations of Shade/Allied and is the
first period where Shade/Allied was a guarantor subsidiary. The condensed
consolidating financial information is as follows:

ITEM 2  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

         The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
nationally branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding
copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products
industry. The Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing
pads, file folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products.
Through its Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important
suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies,
machine papers and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing
office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is
the leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business
envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its
future operating results will not be directly comparable to its historical
operating results because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost
savings from integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not
generally been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may
affect prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.

         Strategic Acquisition. On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired
Shade/Allied, a national supplier of machine papers, principally continuous
computer forms. The purchase price of $50.7 million was financed with
borrowings under the Company's bank credit agreement. Shade/Allied's products
are distributed by both the Ampad and Williamhouse divisions and the
manufacturing plants are integrated into the Ampad division. This acquisition
provided the Company with a more significant position in a fourth product
category.

         Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been
accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
(including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such
as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill,
which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each
year.

         Paper Prices. Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of
goods sold. While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1%
annually since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price
volatility during that period. Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted
new pricing policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the
Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. The Company believes that it
is able to price its products so as to minimize the impact of price volatility
on dollar margins. Paper price volatility has and is expected to continue to
have an effect on net sales and cost of sales.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 1997 and 1996. The Company's historical results of operations for
each of these periods are significantly affected by the results for the
following business acquired by the Company: (i) Niagara which was acquired on
June 28, 1996 and (ii) Shade/Allied which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

                                  (CONTINUED)


THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 1996

         Net Sales for the three months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
$2.9 million, or 1.7%, to $176.5 million from $173.6 million for the three
months ended September 30, 1996. Of this net sales increase, $18.2 million is
related to the acquisition of Shade/Allied offset by a decrease in net sales
from existing operations of approximately $15.3 million primarily as the result
of reduced sales in the mass merchant and superstores customer channels.

Gross Profit for the three months ended September 30, 1997 decreased by $7.8
million, or 21.7%, to $28.2 million from $36.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 1996. The acquisition of Shade/Allied resulted in an
increase in gross profit of approximately $2.4 million. The remaining decrease
in gross profit of approximately $10.2 million is attributable to the reduced
sales from existing operations. Gross profit margin decreased to 16.0% for the
three months ended September 30, 1997 from 20.8% for the three months ended
September 30, 1996. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily
attributable to increases in sales of relatively lower margin products,
including those of Shade/Allied, as well as a highly competitive pricing market
in the third quarter of 1997.

         SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 1997 increased
$2.4 million, or 18.9%, to $14.9 million from $12.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 1996. This increase in SG&A expenses is primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Shade/Allied. Management fees and services
expense for the third quarter of 1997 decreased by approximately $1.2 million
as compared to the same quarter of 1996 due primarily to a one year
non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara.

         Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 1997 of $9.9
million was approximately equal to interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 1996.

         The income tax provision for the three month period ended September
30, 1997 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate
of 43.2% for the three month period ended September 30, 1996. The increase is
attributable primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting
from the Shade/Allied acquisition.


NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 
30, 1996

         Net Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
$85.7 million, or 21.0%, to $493.5 million from $407.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 1996. Of this net sales increase, $52.7 million is
related to the acquisition of Niagara and $46.5 million is related to the
acquisition of Shade/Allied. The remaining decrease of approximately $13.5
million is attributable to existing operations and primarily is the result of
reduced sales in the mass merchant and superstores customer channels.

         Gross Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased by
$7.5 million, or 8.9%, to $92.0 million from $84.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1996. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase in gross
profit is attributable to the acquisition of Niagara and $5.8 million is
attributable to the Shade/Allied acquisition. The remaining decrease in gross
profit of approximately $5.8 million is primarily attributable to reduced sales
from existing operations and competitive pricing pressures. Gross profit margin
decreased to 18.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 from 20.7% for
the nine months ended September 30, 1996. The decrease in gross profit margin
is primarily attributable to the addition of sales of the relatively lower
margin Shade/Allied products and the highly competitive pricing environment
experienced in 1997.

                                  (CONTINUED)



         SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 increased
$7.3 million, or 21.4%, to $41.5 million from $34.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1996. The acquisitions of Niagara and Shade/Allied resulted
in additional expense for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 of
approximately $6.3 million. Management fees and services expense for the first
nine months of 1997 increased by approximately $1.4 million as compared to the
comparable period of 1996 due primarily to a one year non-recurring consulting
agreement with the former president of Niagara which commenced in the third
quarter of 1996.

         Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 1997
decreased $7.3 million to $27.7 million from $35.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1996. The decrease is primarily attributable to the
reduction in long-term debt which resulted from the Company's initial public
offering of common stock in the third quarter of 1996. This decrease in
indebtedness was partially offset by increased borrowings required for the
Shade/Allied acquisition and for the increase in working capital.

         The income tax provision for the nine month period ended September 30,
1997 reflects an effective tax rate of 45.0% versus an effective tax rate of
43.2% for the nine month period ended September 30, 1996. The increase is
attributable primarily to the nondeductible goodwill amortization resulting
from the Niagara and Shade/Allied acquisitions.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 1997 of $30.3 million was primarily the net result of the
following: (i) cash provided from net income of $25.9 million after adjustment
for non-cash expenses, (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $9.6 million
as a result of the increased sales volumes, (iii) an increase in inventories
net of increased accounts payable of $32.1 million due to a buildup in
anticipation of seasonal, promotional and new product sales and (iv) a
reduction in accrued expenses of $21.6 million as annual customer volume
rebates and incentive compensation were paid early in 1997.

          Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 1997 of $62.8 million was due to the acquisition of Shade/Allied and
purchases of equipment.

         Net cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months
of 1997 was $91.5 million and primarily resulted from repayment of $7.0 million
in financing outstanding under the accounts receivable credit facility and
borrowings of $99.4 million under the bank credit agreement to finance: (i)
such repayment, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the purchases of
equipment and (iv) growth in working capital.

         Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
available sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement
and the accounts receivable facility and available cash on hand at September
30, 1997 of $.7 million, will be adequate for the foreseeable future to make
required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to
fund anticipated capital expenditures, including anticipated capital
expenditures of approximately $2 million during the remainder of 1997, and
to meet working capital requirements.

         As part of the Company's expected growth in the near term and in 
connection with certain potential acquisitions which may be completed in the
next year, the Company has commenced discussions with its lenders to increase
the amount of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement
and to modify certain debt covenants. The Company has been given preliminary
oral indications the results of such discussions will be favorable. To the
extent that the Company does not obtain these changes to its existing revolving
credit agreement, the Company may not be in compliance with the required
minimum ratio of consolidated debt to EDITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) at the end of the fourth quarter of 1997. The
Company expects that its banking group will either waive such covenant or amend
the required ratio to an acceptable level for 1998. In the unlikely event that
neither a waiver or amendment is obtained, it may be necessary for the Company
to reduce its capital spending in 1998, alter its capital asset financing
programs in 1998 or lower its operating costs during 1998 in order to meet the
required ratio of consolidated debt to EDITDA.

         Additionally, the ability of the Company to meet its debt service
obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future
performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject
to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors,
including factors beyond the Company's control. A portion of the consolidated
debt of the Company bears interest at floating rates; therefore, its financial
condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest
rates. The Company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement to
minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.

INFLATION

         The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on
its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
1997 and 1996.

NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD

         The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of 
         Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which is
         effective December 15, 1997 and which prescribes a new presentation of
         earnings per share amounts as either "basic" or "diluted." Basic
         earnings per share is to be calculated as net income divided by the
         number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per
         share is to be calculated in a manner similar to the "primary" earnings
         per share currently presented by the Company. Diluted earnings per
         share is calculated as net income divided by the number of outstanding
         shares of common stock, as adjusted for common stock options. The
         Company intends to implement the new accounting standard at the end of
         1997 and,  as part of its 1997 annual report to shareholders and Form
         10-K, will restate its quarterly earnings per share following the
         guidelines in the new accounting standard. If the new standard had been
         implemented during the third quarter of 1997, earnings per share would
         have been presented as follows:
