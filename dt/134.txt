                         ANACOMP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying   condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
accounts of Anacomp,  Inc.  ("Anacomp" or the  "Company")  and its  wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  All significant  intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. These financial statements have not been audited but, in the opinion
of the Company's management,  include all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented. These
financial  statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended September 30, 1998,  included in
the Company's 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interim operating results are not
necessarily indicative of operating results for the full year.

Note 2.  Management Estimates and Assumptions

The Company's preparation of the accompanying  condensed  consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires
its  management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported
amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Estimates have been prepared
on the basis of the most current available  information and actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Note 3.  Reorganization Asset

As of May 31, 1996, the Company adopted Fresh Start Reporting, which resulted in
material changes to the consolidated  balance sheet - including the valuation of
assets,  intangible  assets,  and  liabilities  at fair  market  value,  and the
valuation of equity based on the appraised  reorganization  value of the ongoing
business.  The net result of the valuations  was that the Company  recognized an
asset  captioned   "Reorganization  value  in  excess  of  identifiable  assets"
("Reorganization  Asset")  totaling  $267.5  million as of May 31, 1996.  Net of
accumulated  amortization,  the Reorganization  Asset was $47.2 million at March
31, 1999. Of this amount,  $2.4 million was allocated to the Magnetics Solutions
Group  division (the  "Magnetics  Division")  and was included in "Net assets of
discontinued  operations".  The  Reorganization  Asset is being amortized over a
three  and  one-half  year  period  beginning  May 31,  1996  and  will be fully
amortized by November 30, 1999.

Reorganization  Asset  amortization  was $37.8 million and $37.5 million for the
six-month periods ended March 31, 1998 and 1998, respectively. Of these amounts,
$1.9 million was allocated to discontinued  operations in each period.  On a pro
forma basis for the six-month  periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998,  excluding
Reorganization  Asset amortization,  the Company would have reported income from
continuing  operations  of $5.7 million and $3.4  million,  basic net income per
share of $0.40 and $0.24,  and  diluted net income per share of $0.37 and $0.23,
respectively.

Note 4.  Comprehensive Income

The Company adopted Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No.
130 Reporting  Comprehensive  Income - effective October 1, 1998. This statement
requires the presentation of comprehensive  income,  as defined,  as part of the
basic financial statements.  Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity
during a period except those resulting from investments by and  distributions to
owners.

Note 5.  First Image Acquisition

Effective   June  1,  1998,   the  Company   completed  its   acquisition   (the
"Acquisition")  of assets  constituting  substantially  all of the  business and
operations  (the "First Image  Businesses")  of First Image  Management  Company
("First Image"), a division of First Financial Management  Corporation ("FFMC"),
which in turn is a wholly owned  subsidiary of First Data  Corporation  ("FDC").
The Company also assumed  substantially  all of the ongoing  liabilities  of the
First  Image  Businesses.  The  purchase  price paid by the  Company to FFMC was
$150.0 million, although a post-closing adjustment resulted in FFMC returning to
the Company  $4.4  million to reflect a  shortfall  in the  agreed-upon  working
capital for the First Image  Businesses.  The Acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and the excess of the purchase  price over the estimated  fair value of
net assets  acquired  (referred to as "goodwill")  approximated  $100.0 million,
which is being amortized over a 15-year period on a straight-line basis.

The First Image  Businesses  consisted of (i) image access  services,  primarily
Computer Output to Microfilm  ("COM") and Compact Disc ("CD") services (the "IAS
Business"),  (ii) document print and  distribution  services such as laser print
and mail and  demand  publishing  services  (the  "DPDS  Business"),  and  (iii)
document acquisition services such as health care and insurance claims entry and
data capture services (the "DAS  Business").  The Company sold the DPDS Business
and the DAS Business during the three-month period ended September 30, 1998. The
Company  retained and continues to operate the IAS Business,  whose revenues and
earnings are included in the Company's  results of operations for the six months
ended March 31, 1999.

Note 7.  Income Taxes

The Company's  amortization  of the  Reorganization  Asset is not deductible for
income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  the Company  incurs income tax expense even
though it reports a pre-tax loss due to such amortization.

For the six months ended March 31, 1999 and 1998, income tax expense is reported
for the  Company  based upon an  estimated  effective  tax rate of 42% of pretax
income before amortization of the Reorganization Asset. For the six months ended
March 31,  1999 and 1998,  the  limited  tax  benefit  of the U.S.  Federal  net
operating loss  carryforwards  ("NOL") of the Company resulted in a reduction of
$3.3 million and $2.4 million,  respectively,  in the  Company's  Reorganization
Asset and did not reduce income tax expense.

Note 8.  Loss Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed  based upon the weighted  average number of
shares of the Company's common stock  outstanding  during the period  presented.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents  during
the period presented. Common stock equivalents include options granted under the
Company's  stock  option  plans using the  treasury  stock  method and shares of
common stock  expected to be issued under the Company's  employee stock purchase
plan.  Common stock  equivalents were not used to calculate diluted earnings per
share because of their anti-dilutive  effect.  There are no reconciling items in
calculating  the numerator  for basic and diluted  earnings per share for any of
the periods presented.


<PAGE>


Note 9.  Acquisitions

During the six months  ended March 31, 1999,  the Company  acquired the customer
bases and other specified assets of eight businesses.  Total  consideration paid
at closing was $9.5 million, of which approximately $7.0 million was assigned to
goodwill.  Three of the acquisition agreements include provisions for contingent
cash payments of up to approximately $700,000 in the aggregate.

Note 10.  Subsequent Event - Sale of Magnetics Solutions Division

In  February  1999,  the  Company  adopted a plan to  dispose  of its  Magnetics
Division,  and on April 28, 1999, the Company  signed a definitive  agreement to
sell the Magnetics  Division for a purchase  price of up to $47.5  million.  The
price  includes  $40.0 million in cash at closing,  a $5.0 million  subordinated
note, and incentive  payments of up to $2.5 million based upon sales of magnetic
media  products  to the  Company's  customer  base over the next two years.  The
transaction,  which is contingent  upon  financing and regulatory  approval,  is
expected to close within 45 days of the signing of the Definitive Agreement. The
Company expects to recognize a gain before taxes in excess of $10 million in the
third quarter as a result of the sale.

The  assets  and  liabilities  of the  Magnetics  Division  have  been  reported
separately  as  "Net  assets  of  discontinued   operations"  in  the  condensed
consolidated  balance  sheet as of March 31, 1999.  The  condensed  consolidated
balance sheet as of September  30, 1998 has been restated to provide  consistent
information.  The net assets of the Magnetics Division are summarized as follows
(in thousands):

Item 2.  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and 
Results  of Operations

Certain  statements in this  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of  Operations"  constitute  "forward-looking  statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking  statements  involve known and unknown risks,  uncertainties and
other  important  factors that could cause the actual  results,  performance  or
achievements of the Company,  or industry results, to differ materially from any
future  results,  performance  or  achievements  expressed  or  implied  by such
forward-looking  statements.  Such  risks,  uncertainties  and  other  important
factors  include,  among  others:  general  economic  and  business  conditions;
industry  trends;  industry  capacity;  competition;  raw  materials  costs  and
availability;  currency  fluctuations;  the loss of any significant customers or
suppliers;  changes in business  strategy or  development  plans;  availability,
terms and deployment of capital;  availability of qualified  personnel;  changes
in, or the failure or inability to comply with, government regulation; and other
factors referenced in this report. These  forward-looking  statements speak only
as of the date of this report.

Pro Forma Statements of Operations

      As of May 31,  1996,  the Company  adopted  Fresh Start  Reporting,  which
resulted in material  changes to the  consolidated  balance sheet. See Note 3 to
the accompanying  Condensed  Consolidated Financial Statements for a description
of the Company's  Reorganization  Asset. To facilitate a better understanding of
the Company's  operating  performance  after the  Reorganization  Asset is fully
amortized,  pro forma  condensed  consolidated  statements of operations for the
three and six months  ended March 31, 1999 and 1998 have been  presented  below.
The  only  difference  from  the  Company's  reported  results  is a  pro  forma
adjustment to exclude the amortization of the Reorganization Asset.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended March 31, 1999 vs. Three Months Ended March 31, 1998

      General. Anacomp reported a net loss of $14.9 million for the three months
ended  March 31,  1999,  compared  to a net loss of $15.9  million for the three
months  ended  March  31,  1998.  Earnings  from  continuing  operations  before
interest,  other income,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization  ("EBITDA") were
$24.7 million, or 22.0% of revenues,  for the three months ended March 31, 1999.
This  compares to EBITDA of $16.7  million,  or 18.3% of revenues  for the three
months ended March 31, 1998.

      Revenues.  The Company's  continuing  revenues  increased 23.2% from $91.3
million for the three  months ended March 31,  1998,  to $112.5  million for the
three months ended March 31, 1999. The Company experienced increased revenues of
$22.8 million in its Outsource  Services business line primarily  resulting from
the  acquisition  of the  First  Image IAS  Business  ("IAS  Business")  and the
inclusion of the IAS  Business  operating  results for the three  months  ending
March 31,  1999.  Digital  service  revenues,  which are  included in  Outsource
Services, also increased significantly with quarterly revenues of $5.9 million.

      The Company  experienced  increases in revenues of $3.2 million, or 33.0%,
in Output  Systems for the  three-month  period ended March 31, 1999 compared to
the  comparable  period ended March 31,  1998.  Of this  increase,  $1.3 million
represented  sales of COM Systems and $1.9 million  represented sales of Digital
Solutions.  Offsetting  this increase was a $4.4 million  decline,  or 15.3%, in
Micrographics Supplies revenues. The decrease in Micrographics Supplies revenues
was  the  result  of the  Company's  discontinuance  of the  sale  of  duplicate
microfilm to the  reseller  market,  as well as declining  sales of original COM
microfilm and duplicate microfilm, which is consistent with long-term trends.


<PAGE>


      Gross  Margins.  The Company's  gross margins  increased  22.9% from $35.3
million  (38.6% of revenues) for the three months ended March 31, 1998, to $43.4
million  (38.5% of revenues)  for the three  months ended March 31, 1999.  Total
gross margins,  as a percentage of revenue,  remained level with the prior year.
Outsource Service margins, as a percentage of revenue,  decreased 4.8 percentage
points from 1998 to 1999  principally  because of decreases  in average  selling
prices for  Outsource  Service  business  and because of costs  incurred for the
consolidation  of IAS  Business  data  centers.  This  decrease  was  offset  by
increased  gross margin  percentages  for COM  Systems,  Digital  Solutions  and
Micrographics Supplies.

      Included in the cost of sales and services are  engineering  costs of $2.2
million and $2.5 million for the  three-month  periods  ended March 31, 1999 and
1998,  respectively.  Of those amounts,  $1.7 million and $0.9 million for those
periods,   respectively,   represent   research   and   development   activities
predominantly  related  to  digital  products.  The  remaining  portion  of  the
engineering  costs  represents  support costs for the Company's  current product
offerings.

      Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.   Selling,  general  and
administrative  ("SG&A")  expenses  increased  1.9% from $22.9 million (25.1% of
revenues) for the three months ended March 31, 1998 to $23.4  million  (20.8% of
revenues) for the three months ended March 31, 1999.  This increase is primarily
the result of operating  costs of the IAS  Business and of costs  related to new
strategic  marketing  initiatives.  SG&A costs,  as a  percentage  of  revenues,
decreased  4.3  percentage  points  primarily  because of the added IAS Business
sales volume.

      Amortization  of intangible  assets.  Amortization  of  intangible  assets
increased 141.6% from $2.1 million (2.3% of revenues) for the three months ended
March 31, 1998,  to $5.1 million  (4.5% of revenues)  for the three months ended
March 31, 1999. This increase is principally  the result of the  amortization of
goodwill  associated  with the IAS Business  acquisition in fiscal year 1998 and
the eight acquisitions completed in fiscal year 1999.

      Interest  Expense.  Interest expense increased 29.7% from $8.0 million for
the three  months  ended  March 31, 1998 to $10.3  million for the three  months
ended March 31, 1999. This increase was the result of additional borrowings used
to finance the IAS Business acquisition.

      Provision for Income Taxes.  The Company's  effective tax rate remained at
42% of taxable income for both periods presented. See Note 7 to the accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Six Months Ended March 31, 1999 vs. Six Months Ended March 31, 1998

      General.  Anacomp  reported a net loss of $29.4 million for the six months
ended March 31, 1999, compared to a net loss of $31.2 million for the six months
ended March 31, 1998.  EBITDA was $49.2 million,  or 21.7% of revenues,  for the
six months ended March 31, 1999.  This compares to EBITDA of $33.9  million,  or
18.4% of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 1998.

      Revenues.  The Company's  continuing  revenues increased 23.5% from $183.8
million for the six months ended March 31, 1998,  to $226.9  million for the six
months ended March 31, 1999. The Company experienced increased revenues of $49.8
million in its Outsource  Services  business line while  experiencing  decreased
revenues of $8.1 million in its Micrographic Supplies product line.

      The increase in Outsource  Service  revenues  resulted  primarily from the
June 1, 1998  acquisition  of IAS  Business and the  inclusion of its  operating
results for the six months  ending March 31,  1999.  Digital  Service  revenues,
which are included in Outsource Services,  also increased significantly with six
month revenues of $13.2 million.

      The  decrease in  Micrographics  Supplies  revenues  was the result of the
Company's  discontinuance  of the sale of  duplicate  microfilm  to the reseller
market,  as well as declining  sales of original  COM  microfilm  and  duplicate
microfilm, which is consistent with long-term trends.

<PAGE>

      Gross  Margins.  The Company's  gross margins  increased  24.2% from $70.1
million  (38.2% of revenues)  for the six months ended March 31, 1998,  to $87.1
million  (38.4% of revenues) for the six months ended March 31, 1999.  Outsource
Service  margins,  as a percentage of revenue,  decreased 3.8 percentage  points
from 1998 to 1999 principally because of decreases in average selling prices for
Outsource  Service business and because of costs incurred for the  consolidation
of IAS Business data centers. This decrease was offset by increased gross margin
percentages for COM Systems and Micrographics Supplies.

      Included in the cost of sales and services are  engineering  costs of $4.4
million and $5.0  million  for the  six-month  periods  ended March 31, 1999 and
1998,  respectively.  Of those amounts,  $3.0 million and $1.9 million for those
periods represent research and development  activities  predominantly related to
digital  products.  The remaining  portion of the engineering  costs  represents
support costs for the Company's current product offerings. The Company's digital
research and development activities have increased to an annual spending rate of
$6.5 million in fiscal 1999 compared to $2.5 million in the prior year.

      Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses increased 7.3%
from $44.6  million  (24.2% of revenues) for the six months ended March 31, 1998
to $47.8  million  (21.1% of revenues)  for the six months ended March 31, 1999.
This increase resulted primarily from operating costs of the IAS Business.  SG&A
costs, as a percentage of revenues,  decreased 3.1 percentage  points  primarily
because of the added IAS Business sales volume.

      Amortization  of intangible  assets.  Amortization  of  intangible  assets
increased  105.9% from $4.7 million  (2.6% of revenues) for the six months ended
March 31,  1998,  to $9.6 million  (4.2% of  revenues)  for the six months ended
March 31,  1999.  This  increase is  primarily  related to the  amortization  of
goodwill  associated  with the IAS Business  acquisition in fiscal year 1998 and
the eight acquisitions completed in fiscal year 1999.

      Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased 27.7% from $15.9 million for
the six months  ended March 31, 1998 to $20.3  million for the six months  ended
March 31, 1999.  This increase was the result of additional  borrowings  used to
finance the acquisition of IAS Business.

      Provision for Income Taxes.  The Company's  effective tax rate remained at
42% of taxable income for both periods presented. See Note 7 to the accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

      Anacomp's working capital at March 31, 1999 was $28.5 million, compared to
$27.2 million at September 30, 1998.  Net cash provided by operating  activities
was $19.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 1999,  compared to a use of
$4.1 million in the comparable  prior period.  The current period benefited from
an increase in  depreciation  and  amortization of  approximately  $7.7 million,
which was primarily the result of increased goodwill and depreciable assets from
the  IAS  Business  acquisition.  The  remainder  of  the  improvement  resulted
primarily from a $13.3 million  improvement  in the use of working  capital from
the prior year,  specifically  with respect to accounts  receivable  and current
liabilities.

      Net cash used in  investing  activities  was $21.4  million in the current
period,  compared to $21.0 million in the comparable prior period.  The decrease
in  capital  used to  acquire  companies  and  customer  rights,  along with the
proceeds  from the sale of  businesses,  was  offset by an  increase  in capital
expenditures that were primarily used to integrate the IAS Business.

      Net cash used in financing  activities  decreased  approximately  $330,000
during the six months  ended March 31,  1999 with  respect to the same period in
the prior year. During the current period the issuance of common stock decreased
by  $843,000  and the  Company  repurchased  $2.2  million of common  stock.  In
addition, principal payments on long-term debt decreased by $3.4 million.

<PAGE>

      The Company's  cash balance  (including  restricted  cash) as of March 31,
1999 was $14.5  million  compared to $22.0  million at September  30, 1998.  The
Company also has available an $80 million revolving credit facility.  There were
no amounts outstanding under revolving credit facility as of March 31, 1999. The
Company  borrowed  $12.0  million  on April 1,  1999 to fund the  $18.2  million
semi-annual interest payment on its 10-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes.

      The Company has  significant  debt  service  obligations.  As of March 31,
1999,  the  Company  had $335  million  of  10-7/8%  Senior  Subordinated  Notes
outstanding. The notes are due in April 2004. The ability of the Company to meet
its debt service and other  obligations will depend upon its future  performance
and is subject  to  financial,  economic  and other  factors,  some of which are
beyond its control.  However,  the Company  believes  that cash  generated  from
operations,  cash on hand,  cash to be received  from the sale of the  Magnetics
Division,  and cash  available  under  its  revolving  credit  facility  will be
sufficient to fund its debt service requirements,  acquisition  strategies,  and
working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.

Year 2000

      Anacomp  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  "year  2000"  program  for the
products that it sells or  distributes in the  marketplace.  Under this program,
the Company has assessed all of its critical  software and hardware  products to
determine what remediation,  if any, is necessary for the proper  functioning of
these  systems in the year 2000 and  beyond.  The  Company  has worked  with its
outside suppliers to ensure that they will continue to support the products that
they supply to Anacomp for resale, including the performance by the suppliers of
any required  year 2000  remediation.  Anacomp has also analyzed and updated for
year  2000  purposes   certain  software  and  hardware  systems  that  it  uses
internally.  The  Company  continues  to  consider  year 2000 issues for all new
products  and services as well as those in  development  or included in business
acquisitions.

      State of Readiness.  Anacomp's  overall state of readiness can be assessed
by describing its specific readiness in four key areas,  namely its products and
services,  its suppliers' products and services,  its internal systems,  and its
products in development.

      Anacomp has completed the  assessment,  remediation  and year 2000 testing
phases  of  nearly  all  supported   products  and  services,   including  those
responsible  for  generating  the  material  portion  of its  revenues.  Anacomp
summarizes the status of each  completed  product or service in a written report
to the  Company's  year 2000  steering  committee for archiving in the Company's
year 2000 database.  These  processes have been reviewed and approved by a third
party consultant retained for this purpose.

      The  implementation  phase of the Company's year 2000 project depends upon
the response of the Company's  customers  who may require  upgrades or migration
paths.  Anacomp is in the process of communicating with identified customers and
has no reason to believe that all  customers  who require  upgrades or migration
will not receive them.  To this end,  Anacomp has offered and continues to offer
financial  incentives  to  encourage  early  responses  and to avoid peak demand
loads,  although  no  assurance  can be made  that  the  demand  will be  spread
sufficiently to eliminate  delays in  implementation.  Anacomp has also launched
its  "Analog as a Fail Safe"  campaign to educate  customers  about the value of
microfilm as a way to minimize the risk of the year 2000. Although customers may
divert  expenditures away from these microfilm products and services in order to
fund other year 2000 remediation, Anacomp encourages customers to consider these
products and services as a cost-effective  backup to digital storage because the
retrieval of data stored on microfilm does not require digital technology.

      Anacomp has  categorized  approximately  850 of its suppliers  into one of
four categories depending upon the criticality of the product or service and the
amount of time  necessary to implement  the  contingency  plans that Anacomp has
identified.  If a supplier  does not declare its  readiness to Anacomp in enough
time to permit implementation of its contingency plans before December 31, 1999,
Anacomp may replace the supplier, have the supplier hold additional inventory of
the supplier's products,  or implement  alternative  contingency plans depending
upon the product or service provided.


<PAGE>

      As of April 30, 1999,  Anacomp had received written responses to Anacomp's
year 2000 readiness  questionnaire  from  approximately 90% of the 165 suppliers
that  Anacomp  deems  critical to its  operations.  Anacomp has either  received
declarations  of  readiness  from,  or  established  contingency  plans for, all
critical suppliers.  For example,  Anacomp is currently interviewing alternative
sources of key products as part of its contingency planning but has no reason to
believe that any of its critical suppliers will not be ready in time.

      For those Anacomp  products that incorporate the products of a third party
supplier,  Anacomp  continues  to  request  that  its  suppliers  disclose  test
procedures and results. Anacomp has also requested that its vendors in the human
resources area, such as its retirement,  health and insurance providers, respond
in  writing  as to their  readiness,  but  there can be no  assurance  that such
vendors will either respond or achieve readiness in a timely fashion.

      Anacomp has identified all internal software and hardware products used in
its  corporate  headquarters  in  Poway,  California,  including  those  used to
assimilate and report financial  information and to handle billing,  collections
and electronic commerce.  In those instances where remediation or renovation was
required,  Anacomp has either completed or has nearly completed such remediation
or renovation. Anacomp is in the process of completing the documentation of such
efforts for its year 2000 archives.

      The Company  continues to develop new products and services and to acquire
new businesses.  Anacomp develops and tests each new product, sometimes with the
assistance of an outside  consultant,  for year 2000 readiness.  Businesses that
Anacomp  acquires,  such as First  Image,  are  subject to the same  assessment,
remediation, testing and implementation phases as those described above.

      Costs.  Total  expenditures  on its year 2000 project,  including costs of
outside  parties  such as  consultants  and  attorneys,  costs of  hardware  and
software  remediation,  and internal labor,  travel and out of pocket  expenses,
were  approximately $0.3 million and $2.3 million for fiscal year 1997 and 1998,
respectively,  and is estimated  to be $1.2  million in fiscal year 1999.  These
figures  include  estimates  from  the  engineering,  manufacturing,  legal  and
information technology departments of the Company.

      Risks.  There can be no  assurance  that the  Company  and its vendors and
suppliers will be able to identify all year 2000 issues before problems manifest
themselves or to complete all  remediation in the required time frame.  Further,
it is possible  that the future level of expenses in the  Company's  remediation
efforts could rise significantly.

      The Company  relies upon the  continuous  provision of services from third
parties such as electrical and telecommunication utilities around the world, and
the Company plans to enhance its electronic data transmission capabilities.  Any
sustained  disruption  of  service  or  capability  could  adversely  impact the
Company's  ability to operate its business.  Finally,  there can be no assurance
that,  if left  unremedied,  the products or services  that the Company sells or
distributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that the
Company uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of the
Company to report its financial results.

      Contingency  Plans. In those  instances where the Company  determines that
year 2000  problems  with its  operational  facilities  may not be identified or
remediated in time, the Company believes that its business will still be able to
function without substantial interruption. For example, COM services provided in
a data center that  experiences  a loss of power due to a third party  utility's
failure to identify or remediate an isolated  year 2000 problem could be shifted
to another data center without substantial interruption. In addition, electronic
transmission  of data  could be  replaced  with  manual  delivery  of data  upon
completion of certain  modifications.  In those instances where an installed COM
customer  experiences a year 2000 problem while operating its own COM equipment,
Anacomp  could offer its COM services to the customer at one of its data centers
upon  completion  of  certain  modifications.  This  seamless  nature of many of
Anacomp's products and services forms the basis of Anacomp's ongoing contingency
planning.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

      The Company does not have any significant financial instruments other than
fixed rate  indebtedness.  The general level of U.S.  interest rates,  the LIBOR
rate or both affects the  Company's  revolving  credit  facility.  However,  the
Company had no amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility on March
31, 1999.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.       Legal Proceedings.

      The Company and its  subsidiaries  are  potential or named  defendants  in
several  lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary  course of business.  While
the outcome of such claims,  lawsuits or other  proceedings  against the Company
cannot be predicted with certainty,  management expects that any liability under
the  foregoing,  to the extent not provided for through  insurance or otherwise,
will not have a material  adverse effect on the financial  conditions or results
of operations of the Company.

      On August 29, 1997, Access Solutions  International,  Inc. ("ASI") filed a
complaint for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court,  District of Rhode
Island, against Data/Ware Development,  Inc. ("Data/Ware"),  of which Anacomp is
the successor by merger, and The Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak").  The complaint
seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages,  including attorney's fees, for
the alleged  infringement  by Data/Ware and Kodak of ASI's United States Letters
Patent No. 4,775,969 for "Optical Disk Storage Format,  Method and Apparatus for
Emulating a Magnetic  Tape Drive" and No.  5,034,914  for "Optical  Disk Storage
Method and  Apparatus  with  Buffered  Interface."  The  Company has assumed the
defense  of this  matter on behalf of both  Data/Ware  and Kodak,  although  the
Company  has  also  requested   indemnification   from  the  principal   selling
shareholder of Data/Ware.  Discovery in this matter continues, with any trial to
occur probably not before the third calendar quarter of 1999. Although there can
be no assurance as to the eventual outcome of this matter,  the Company believes
that it has numerous meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Item 2.  Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds.

(c) Unregistered  Securities - Pursuant to the 1996 Non-employee  Director Stock
Option  Plan  (Amended  and  Restated  as of  December  1,  1997),  non-employee
directors of the Company may elect to receive their annual  retainer in the form
of options to acquire common stock of the Company.  Pursuant to such  elections,
during the  three-month  period  ending  March 31,  1999,  an aggregate of 1,875
options was granted to  directors  in lieu of  aggregate  cash  compensation  of
$9,375.  The issuance of such options was effected in reliance  upon the private
placement exemption set forth in Section 4 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended,  on the  basis of the  directors'  familiarity  with the  business  and
affairs of the Company. No underwriting fees or discounts were applicable to the
transactions.  The options are first  exercisable  six months  after the date of
grant and remain exercisable through the tenth anniversary of the grant date, at
an exercise price of $18.625 per share.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

      At the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders  held on February 8, 1999,
the Company's shareholders:  (i) approved amendments to and a restatement of the
Company's  1996 Long-Term  Incentive  Plan to, among other matters,  increase by
1,000,000  the  number  of  shares  of  the  Company's   common  stock  issuable
thereunder,  by a vote of 8,908,639 shares in favor to 2,477,524  opposed,  with
2,461,977  shares  abstaining;  and (ii)  approved an amendment to the Company's
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized common
stock issuable  thereunder from  20,000,000 to 40,000,000,  by a vote of 12,752,
848 shares in favor to 1,085,463 opposed, with 9,829 shares abstaining.

Item 6.  Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K.

(a)    Exhibit 3.1 - Amended and  Restricted  Articles of  Incorporation  of the
       Company as of February 8, 1999.

       Exhibit 3.2 - Amended and Restricted Bylaws of the Company as of February
       9, 1998.

       Exhibit 27.1 - Financial Data Schedule.

(b)    The Company  filed no reports on Form 8-K during the quarter ended March 
       31, 1999.

      The total  number of shares that the  Corporation  has  authority to issue
shall be 41,000,000  shares  consisting of 40,000,000 common shares (the "Common
Shares"),   and  1,000,000  preferred  shares  (the  "Preferred  Shares").   The
Corporation's  shares  shall  have  a par  value  of one  cent  per  share.  The
Corporation  shall  have the  power to issue  fractional  shares or scrip in the
manner and to the extent now or hereafter  permitted by the laws of the State of
Indiana.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 TERMS OF SHARES

      Section 1. General  Terms of All Shares.  The  Corporation  shall have the
power to acquire (by purchase,  redemption,  or otherwise),  hold, own,  pledge,
sell, transfer,  assign,  reissue,  cancel or otherwise dispose of the shares of
the  Corporation  in the manner and to the extent now or hereafter  permitted by
the laws of the State of Indiana,  including the power to purchase,  redeem,  or
otherwise  acquire the  Corporation's  own shares,  directly or  indirectly  and
without  pro rata  treatment  of the owners of holders of any class or series of
shares,  unless,  after giving effect thereto, the Corporation would not be able
to pay its debts as they  become  due in the usual  course  of  business  or the
Corporation's  total assets would be less than its total liabilities and without
regard to any  amounts  that  would be  needed,  if the  Corporation  were to be
dissolved at the time of the  purchase,  redemption,  or other  acquisition,  to
satisfy  the  preferential   rights  upon  dissolution  of  shareholders   whose
preferential  rights are  superior  to those of the holders of the shares of the
Corporation being purchased,  redeemed, or otherwise acquired,  unless otherwise
expressly  provided  with  respect  to a  series  of  Preferred  Shares  in  the
provisions of these Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  adopted by
the Board of Directors  pursuant to Section 3(a) of Article VI hereof describing
the terms of such series.  Shares of the  Corporation  purchased,  redeemed,  or
otherwise  acquired  by it  shall  constitute  authorized  and  issued  but  not
outstanding  shares,  unless  the Board of  Directors  shall at any time adopt a
resolution providing that such shares constitute authorized but issued shares.

      The Board of Directors of the Corporation may dispose of, issue,  and sell
shares in accordance  with, and in such amounts as may be permitted by, the laws
of the  State of  Indiana  and the  provisions  of these  Amended  and  Restated
Articles of Incorporation and for such  consideration,  at such price or prices,
at such  time or  times  and upon  such  terms  and  conditions  (including  the
privilege of selectively repurchasing the same) as the Board of Directors of the
Corporation  shall  determine  to be  adequate,  without  the  authorization  or
approval by any  shareholders  of the  Corporation.  When disposed of, issued or
sold, such shares will be fully paid and non-assessable.  Shares may be disposed
of, issued,  and sold to such persons,  firms,  or  corporations as the Board of
Directors may  determine,  without any  preemptive or other right on the part of
the owners or holders of other shares of the Corporation of any class or kind to
acquire such shares by reason of their ownership of such other shares.

      The Corporation shall have the power to declare and pay dividends or other
distributions upon the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation, subject
to the  limitation  that a dividend  or other  distribution  may not be made if,
after giving it effect,  the  Corporation  would not be able to pay its debts as
they  become due in the usual  course of  business  or the  Corporation's  total
assets  would be less  than its  total  liabilities  and  without  regard to any
amounts  that would be needed,  if the  Corporation  were to be dissolved at the
time of the dividend or other  distribution,  to satisfy the preferential rights
upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those
of the holders of shares  receiving the dividend or other  distribution,  unless
otherwise expressly provided with respect to a series of Preferred Shares in the
provisions of these Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  adopted by
the Board of Directors  pursuant to Section  3(a) of this Article VI  describing
the terms of such series. The Board of Directors may base a determination that a
distribution is not prohibited  either on financial  statements  prepared on the
basis  of  accounting  practices  and  principles  that  are  reasonable  in the
circumstances  or on a fair  valuation or other method that is reasonable in the
circumstances. The Corporation shall have the power to issue shares of one class
or series as a share dividend or other  distribution in respect of that class or
series or one or more  other  classes  or series  without  the  approval  of the
holders  of either  of those  classes  or  series,  except  as may be  otherwise
provided with respect to a series of Preferred Shares in the provisions of these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation adopted by the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Article VI describing the terms of such series.

      Section 2. Terms of Common  Shares.  The Common  Shares  shall be equal in
every respect insofar as their relationship to the Corporation is concerned, but
such  equality of rights shall not imply  equality of treatment as to redemption
or other acquisition of shares by the Corporation.  Subject to the rights of the
holders of any issued and  outstanding  Preferred  Shares under this Article VI,
the  holders  of  Common  Shares  shall be  entitled  to share  ratably  in such
dividends or other distributions  (other than purchases,  redemptions,  or other
acquisitions of Common Shares of the  Corporation),  if any, as are declared and
paid from time to time on the Common  Shares at the  discretion  of the Board of
Directors.  In the event of any liquidation,  dissolution,  or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, after payment shall have been made
to the holders of the Preferred Shares of the full amount to which they shall be
entitled  under this Article VI, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled,
to the exclusion of the holders of the  Preferred  Shares of any and all series,
to share,  ratably  according  to the number of shares of Common  Shares held by
them, in all remaining  assets of the Corporation  available for distribution to
its shareholders.




      Section 3.  Terms of Preferred Shares.

      (a)  Preferred  Shares  may be  issued  from  time  to time in one or more
series,  each  such  series  to have such  distinguishing  designation  and such
preferences,  limitations,  and relative voting and other rights as shall be set
forth in these Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation.  Subject to the
requirements of the Corporation Law and subject to all other provisions of these
Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation,  the Board of Directors of the
Corporation  may  create  one or more  series  of  Preferred  Shares  and  shall
determine the preferences,  limitations, and relative voting and other rights of
one or more series of Preferred Shares before the issuance of any shares of that
series by the adoption of an amendment to these Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation  that specifies the terms of that series of Preferred Shares.  All
shares of a series of Preferred  Shares must have  preferences,  limitations and
relative voting and other rights  identical to those of other shares of the same
series.  No series of Preferred  Shares need have  preferences,  limitations  or
relative  voting or other  rights  identical  with those of any other  series of
Preferred Shares.

      Before  issuing any shares of a series of Preferred  Shares,  the Board of
Directors  shall adopt an  amendment to these  Amended and Restated  Articles of
Incorporation,  which shall be  effective  without any  shareholder  approval or
other action,  that fixes and sets forth the distinguishing  designation of such
series; the number of shares that shall constitute such series, which number may
be  increased  or  decreased  (but not below the number of shares  thereof  then
outstanding)  from time to time by action  of the  Board of  Directors;  and the
preferences,  limitations,  and relative  voting and other rights of the series.
Authority  is  hereby  expressly  vested  in the  Board  of  Directors,  by such
amendment,  to fix all of the  preferences  or rights,  and any  qualifications,
limitations,  or restrictions of such  preferences or rights,  of such series to
the full extent permitted by the Corporation  Law;  provided,  however,  that no
such preferences, rights, qualifications,  limitations, or restrictions shall be
in conflict with these  Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  or any
amendment thereof.

      (b)  Preferred  Shares of any  series  that have  been  redeemed  (whether
through the  operation  of a sinking  fund or  otherwise)  or  purchased  by the
Corporation,  or that, if  convertible,  have been  converted into shares of the
Corporation  of any other  class or series,  may be  reissued  as a part of such
series or of any other series of Preferred  Shares,  subject to such limitations
(if any) as may be fixed by the Board of  Directors  with respect to such series
of Preferred Shares in accordance with Section 3(a) of this Article VI.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                  VOTING RIGHTS

      Section 1. Common Shares.  Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation
Law and subject to such shareholder disclosure and recognition procedures (which
may  include  sanctions  for  noncompliance  therewith  to  the  fullest  extent
permitted by the Corporation  Law) as the Corporation may by action of the Board
of Directors establish, the Common Shares have unlimited voting rights. At every
meeting of the  shareholders  of the  Corporation  every holder of Common Shares
shall be entitled  to one (1) vote in person or by proxy for each  Common  Share
standing in such holder's name on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.

      Section 2. Preferred Shares.  Except as required by the Corporation Law or
by the  provisions  of these  Amended and  Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation
adopted by the Board of Directors  pursuant to Section 3(a) of Article VI hereof
describing  the terms of Preferred  Shares or a series  thereof,  the holders of
Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights or powers.  Preferred Shares shall,
when validly  issued by the  Corporation,  entitle the record holder  thereof to
vote as and on such  matters,  but only as and on such  matters  as the  holders
thereof are entitled to vote under the  Corporation  Law or under the provisions
of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation  adopted by the Board of
Directors  pursuant to Section 3(a) of Article VI hereof describing the terms of
Preferred Shares or a series thereof (which  provisions may provide for special,
conditional,   limited,  or  unlimited  voting  rights,  including  multiple  or
fractional  votes  per  share,  or for no right to vote,  except  to the  extent
required by the Corporation Law) and subject to such shareholder  disclosure and
recognition procedures (which may include sanctions for noncompliance  therewith
to the fullest extent  permitted by the Corporation  Law) as the Corporation may
by action of the Board of Directors establish.

      Section 3. Non-voting Equity Securities.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  set forth in this Article  VII,  the  Corporation  shall not issue any
non-voting equity securities;  provided, however, that this provision,  included
in these  Amended and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  in  compliance  with
Section 1123(a)(6) of the United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended (the
"Bankruptcy  Code"),  shall have no force and effect  beyond  that  required  by
Section  1123(a)(6) of the  Bankruptcy  Code and shall be effective  only for so
long as Section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is in effect and applicable to
the Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                    DIRECTORS

      Section 1. Number. The Board of Directors at the time of adoption of these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation is composed of seven (7) members.
The number of  Directors  shall be fixed by, or fixed in  accordance  with,  the
Bylaws.  The Bylaws may also provide for  staggering the terms of the members of
the Board of Directors by dividing the total number of Directors into two (2) or
three (3) groups (with each group  containing  one-half (1/2) or one third (1/3)
of the  total,  as near as may be)  whose  terms of office  expire at  different
times.

      Section 2.  Election of  Directors  by Holders of  Preferred  Shares.  The
holders of one (1) or more series of  Preferred  Shares may be entitled to elect
all or a specified  number of  Directors,  but only to the extent and subject to
limitations  as may be set forth in the provisions of these Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation  adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section
3(a) of  Article  VI  hereof  describing  the terms of the  series of  Preferred
Shares.

      Section 3.  Vacancies.  Vacancies  occurring in the Board of Directors 
shall be filled in the manner  provided  in the Bylaws or, if the Bylaws do 
not provide  for the filling of vacancies, in the manner provided by the 
Corporation Law.

      Section 4. Removal of Directors. Any or all of the members of the Board of
Directors  may be  removed,  for good  cause,  at a meeting of the  shareholders
called  expressly for that purpose,  by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority  of the  outstanding  shares  then  entitled  to vote at an election of
Directors.  However,  a Director elected by the holders of a series of Preferred
Shares as  authorized  by Section 2 of Article  VIII may be removed  only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding  shares of that
series then entitled to vote at an election of  Directors.  Directors may not be
removed in the absence of good cause or by the Board of Directors.

      Section 5.  Liability of  Directors.  A Director's  responsibility  to the
Corporation shall be limited to discharging his duties as a Director,  including
his duties as a member of any committee of the Board of Directors  upon which he
may serve, in good faith,  with the care an ordinarily  prudent person in a like
position  would  exercise  under  similar  circumstances,  and in a  manner  the
Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, all
based on the facts then known to the Director.

      In discharging his duties,  a Director is entitled to rely on information,
opinions,  reports,  or  statements,  including  financial  statements and other
financial data, if prepared or presented by:

      (a) One (1) or more  officers or  employees  of the  Corporation  whom the
Director  reasonably  believes  to be  reliable  and  competent  in the  matters
presented;

      (b)   Legal  counsel,  public  accountants,  or  other  persons  as to the
            matters the Director  reasonably  believes are within such  person's
            professional or expert competence; or

      (c)   A  committee  of the Board of which the  Director is not a member if
            the Director reasonably believes the Committee merits confidence;

but a  Director  is not  acting  in good  faith if the  Director  has  knowledge
concerning  the matter in question that makes  reliance  otherwise  permitted by
this Section 5 unwarranted. A Director may, in considering the best interests of
the Corporation, consider the effects of any action on shareholders,  employees,
suppliers, and customers of the Corporation, and communities in which offices or
other  facilities  of the  Corporation  are located,  and any other  factors the
Director considers pertinent.

      Directors shall be immune from personal  liability for any action taken as
a Director,  or any failure to take any action,  to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable  provisions of the Corporation Law from time to time in effect
and by general principles of corporate law.

      Section 6.  Nonmonetary  Factors in Acquisition  Proposals.  In connection
with the exercise of its judgment in  determining  what is in the best interests
of the  Corporation and its  stockholders  when evaluating a proposal by another
person or  persons to  acquire  some  material  part or all of the  business  or
properties of the  Corporation  (whether by merger,  consolidation,  purchase of
assets, stock reclassification,  or recapitalization,  spin-off, liquidation, or
otherwise)  or to  acquire  some  material  part  or  all of  the  stock  of the
Corporation  (whether by a tender or exchange  offer or some other  means),  the
Board of  Directors  of the  Corporation  may, in addition  to  considering  the
adequacy  of  the   consideration  to  be  paid  in  connection  with  any  such
transaction, consider all of the following factors and any other factors that it
deems  relevant:  (a) the social and economic  effects of the transaction on the
Corporation and its subsidiaries and their employees,  customers,  and creditors
and the communities in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries operate or are
located;  (b) the business and financial condition and earnings prospects of the
acquiring  person or persons,  including,  but not limited to, debt  service and
other  existing  or likely  financial  obligations  of the  acquiring  person or
persons  and  their  affiliates  and  associates,  the  possible  effect of such
conditions  upon the  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  and the communities in
which the Corporation and its subsidiaries  operate or are located;  and (c) the
competence, experience, and integrity of the acquiring person or persons and its
or their management and affiliates and associates.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                      PROVISIONS FOR REGULATION OF BUSINESS
                      AND CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS OF CORPORATION

      Section 1. Bylaws.  The Board of Directors  shall have the exclusive power
to make,  alter,  amend, or repeal, or to waive provisions of, the Bylaws of the
Corporation  by the  affirmative  vote of a majority of the number of  Directors
then in office at the time,  except as  provided  by the  Corporation  Law.  All
provisions  for the  regulation of the business and management of the affairs of
the  Corporation   not  stated  in  these  Amended  and  Restated   Articles  of
Incorporation  shall be stated in the Bylaws.  The Board of  Directors  may also
adopt  Emergency  Bylaws of the  Corporation  and shall have the exclusive power
(except as may otherwise be provided therein) to make, alter,  amend, or repeal,
or to waive  provisions of, the Emergency  Bylaws by the  affirmative  vote of a
majority of the entire number of Directors at the time.

      Section 2.  Indemnification of Officers, Directors, and Other Eligible 
Persons.

(a)         To the extent not  inconsistent  with applicable law, every Eligible
            Person shall be indemnified by the Corporation against all Liability
            and  reasonable  Expense  that may be incurred by him in  connection
            with or resulting from any Claim:

            (i)   if such Eligible Person is Wholly Successful with respect to 
                  the Claim, or

            (ii)  if not  Wholly  Successful,  then if such  Eligible  Person is
                  determined,  as provided in either  Section  2(f) or 2(g),  to
                  have acted in good faith, in what he reasonably believed to be
                  in the best  interests  of the  Corporation  or at  least  not
                  opposed to its best interests  and, in addition,  with respect
                  to any criminal  Claim is  determined  to have had  reasonable
                  cause  to  believe  that  his  conduct  was  lawful  or had no
                  reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

The termination of any Claim, by judgment,  order,  settlement  (whether with or
without  court  approval),  or  conviction  or upon a plea of  guilty of or nolo
contendere,  or its equivalent,  shall not create a presumption that an Eligible
Person did not meet the  standards  of conduct  set forth in clause (ii) of this
subsection  (a).  The actions of an Eligible  Person with respect to an employee
benefit  plan  subject to the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974
shall be  deemed  to have  been  taken in what the  Eligible  Person  reasonably
believed to be the best interests of the  Corporation or at least not opposed to
its best interests if the Eligible Person  reasonably  believed he was acting in
conformity  with the  requirements  of such Act or he  reasonably  believed  his
actions to be in the interests of the  participants in or  beneficiaries  of the
plan.

      (b)  The  term  "Claim"  as used in this  Section  2 shall  include  every
pending,  threatened,  or completed claim,  action,  suit, or proceeding and all
appeals thereof  (whether  brought by or in the right of this Corporation or any
other   corporation  or  otherwise),   civil,   criminal,   administrative,   or
investigative,  formal or  informal,  in which an  Eligible  Person  may  become
involved, as a party of otherwise:  (i) by reason of his being or having been an
Eligible  Person,  or (ii) by reason of any action  taken or not taken by him in
his capacity as an Eligible Person, whether or not he continued in such capacity
at the time such Liability or Expense shall have been incurred.

      (c) The term  "Eligible  Person" as used in this Section  shall mean every
person (and the estate,  heirs, and personal  representative of such person) who
is or was a Director,  officer,  employee,  or agent of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,  officer, employee,
agent,  or fiduciary of another  foreign or domestic  corporation,  partnership,
joint venture,  trust,  employee benefit plan, or other  organization or entity,
whether for profit or not. An Eligible  Person shall also be  considered to have
been serving an employee  benefit plan at the request of the  Corporation if his
duties to the Corporation also imposed duties on, or otherwise involved services
by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.

      (d) The terms  "Liability"  and  "Expense" as used in this Section 2 shall
include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts
of judgments,  fines, or penalties against (including excise taxes assessed with
respect to an employee  benefit  plan),  and amounts paid in settlement by or on
behalf of, an Eligible Person.

      (e) The term "Wholly  Successful" as used in this Section 2 shall mean (i)
termination  of any Claim  against the Eligible  Person in question  without any
finding of  liability  or guilt  against  him,  (ii)  approval by a court,  with
knowledge of the indemnity  herein  provided,  of a settlement of any Claim,  or
(iii) the  expiration of a reasonable  period of time after making or threatened
making of any Claim without the institution of the same,  without any payment or
promise made to induce a settlement.

      (f) Every Eligible Person claiming  indemnification  hereunder (other than
one who has been Wholly  Successful with respect to any Claim) shall be entitled
to  indemnification  (i) if  special  independent  legal  counsel,  which may be
regular counsel of the Corporation or other disinterested person or persons (who
may be members of the Board of Directors),  in either case selected by the Board
of  Directors,  whether or not a  disinterested  quorum  exists (such counsel or
person or persons being hereinafter called the "Referee"),  shall deliver to the
Corporation a written finding that such Eligible Person has met the standards of
conduct  set  forth in clause  (ii) of  Section  2(a),  and (ii) if the Board of
Directors,  acting  upon  such  written  finding,  so  determines.  The Board of
Directors   shall,   if  an   Eligible   Person  is  found  to  be  entitled  to
indemnification   pursuant  to  the  preceding  sentence,   also  determine  the
reasonableness of the Eligible Person's  Expenses.  The Eligible Person claiming
indemnification shall, if requested, appear before the Referee, answer questions
that the Referee deems relevant, and shall be given ample opportunity to present
to  the  Referee  evidence  upon  which  he  relies  for  indemnification.   The
Corporation  shall,  at  the  request  of the  Referee,  make  available  facts,
opinions,  or other  evidence in any way relevant to the Referee's  finding that
are within the possession or control of the Corporation.

      (g) If an Eligible  Person  claiming  indemnification  pursuant to Section
2(f) is found not to be entitled thereto,  or if the Board of Directors fails to
select a Referee under Section 2(f) within a reasonable amount of time following
a written  request of an Eligible  Person for the selection of a Referee,  or if
the  Referee  or the  Board of  Directors  fails to make a  determination  under
Section 2(f) within a reasonable  amount of time  following  the  selection of a
Referee,  the Eligible  Person may apply for  indemnification  with respect to a
Claim to a court of competent jurisdiction, including a court in which the Claim
is pending against the Eligible Person. On receipt of an application, the court,
after  giving  notice  to the  Corporation  and  giving  the  Corporation  ample
opportunity to present to the court any information or evidence  relating to the
claim for  indemnification  that the Corporation  deems  appropriate,  may order
indemnification  if it  determines  that the  Eligible  Person  is  entitled  to
indemnification  with respect to the Claim because such Eligible  Person met the
standards  of conduct  set forth in clause  (ii) of Section  2(a).  If the court
determines  that the Eligible Person is entitled to  indemnification,  the court
shall also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person's Expenses.

      (h) The right of  indemnification  provided in this  Section 2 shall be in
addition to any rights to which any Eligible  Person may  otherwise be entitled.
Irrespective of the provisions of this Section 2, the Board of Directors may, at
any time and from time to time,  (i)  approve  indemnification  of any  Eligible
Person to the full extent  permitted by the provision of  applicable  law at the
time in effect,  whether on  account  of past or future  transactions,  and (ii)
authorize the  Corporation  to purchase and maintain  insurance on behalf of any
Eligible Person against any Liability  asserted  against him and incurred by him
in any such capacity,  or arising out of his status as such,  whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability.

      (i) Expenses  incurred by an Eligible Person with respect to any Claim may
be advanced by the Corporation (by action of the Board of Directors,  whether or
not a disinterested  quorum exists) prior to the final disposition  thereof upon
receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of the recipient to repay such amount
unless he is determined to be entitled to indemnification.

      (j) The  provisions  of this  Section 2 shall be  deemed to be a  contract
between the  Corporation  and each  Eligible  Person,  and an Eligible  Person's
rights hereunder shall not be diminished or otherwise  adversely affected by any
repeal,  amendment,  or modification of this Section 2 that occurs subsequent to
such person becoming an Eligible Person.

      (k) The provisions of this Section 2 shall be applicable to Claims made or
commenced after the adoption  hereof,  whether arising from acts or omissions to
act occurring before or after the adoption hereof.

      Section 3. Amendment or Repeal. Except as otherwise expressly provided for
in these Amended and Restated Articles of  Incorporation,  the Corporation shall
be deemed, for all purposes,  to have reserved the right to amend, alter, change
or repeal any  provision  contained in these  Amended and  Restated  Articles of
Incorporation  to the extent and in the manner  now or  hereafter  permitted  or
prescribed by statute,  and all rights herein  conferred upon  shareholders  are
granted subject to such reservation.

                           AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

                                       OF

                                  ANACOMP, INC.

                             As of February 9, 1998

                                    ARTICLE I
                            MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

      Section 1.1 Annual  Meetings.  Annual meetings of the  shareholders of the
Corporation  shall be held at such hour and at such place  within or without the
State of Indiana as shall be designated by the Board of Directors.

      Section 1.2 Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation  may be  called  at  any  time  by the  Board  of  Directors  or the
President.  In  calling  such a special  meeting of  shareholders,  the Board of
Directors or the  President,  as the case may be,  calling a special  meeting of
shareholders  shall set the date, time, and place of such meeting,  which may be
held within or without the State of Indiana.

      Section 1.3 Notices.  A written notice,  stating the date, time, and place
of any  meeting  of the  shareholders,  and in the  case  of a  special  meeting
containing  a  description  of the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is
called,  shall be delivered or mailed by the  Secretary of the  Corporation,  to
each  shareholder of record of the Corporation  entitled to notice of or to vote
at such  meeting no fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the
date  of  the  meeting,  or  as  otherwise  provided  by  the  Indiana  Business
Corporation  Law  ("Corporation  Law").  Notice of  shareholders'  meetings,  if
mailed,  shall be mailed,  postage  prepaid,  to each shareholder at his address
shown in the Corporation's current record of shareholders.  Only business within
the purpose or purposes  described  in the meeting  notice may be conducted at a
special meeting of shareholders.

      A shareholder  or his proxy may at any time waive notice of any meeting of
shareholders if the waiver is in writing and is delivered to the Corporation for
inclusion  in  the  minutes  or  filing  with  the  Corporation's   records.   A
shareholder's attendance at a meeting, whether in person or by proxy, (a) waives
objection  to lack of notice or  defective  notice of the  meeting,  unless  the
shareholder or his proxy at the beginning of the meeting  objects to holding the
meeting or  transacting  business at the  meeting,  and (b) waives  objection to
consideration  of a  particular  matter at the  meeting  that is not  within the
purpose or purposes  described in the meeting notice,  unless the shareholder or
his  proxy  objects  to  considering  the  matter  when  it is  presented.  Each
shareholder  who has in the manner above provided  waived notice or objection to
notice of the shareholders'  meeting shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given due notice of such meeting, including the purpose or purposes thereof.

      If an annual or special  shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different
date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if
the new date,  time or place is  announced  at the meeting  before  adjournment,
unless a new record date is or must be  established  for the adjourned  meeting.
The Board of Directors must fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned to
a date more than one  hundred  twenty  (120)  days  after the date fixed for the
original meeting.

      Section 1.4 Voting. Except as otherwise provided by the Corporation Law or
the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation,  each share of the capital stock of
any  class  of the  Corporation  that is  outstanding  at the  record  date  and
represented in person or by proxy at the annual or special meeting shall entitle
the record holder thereof, or his proxy, to one (1) vote on each matter voted on
at the meeting.

      Section 1.5 Quorum. Unless the Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation or
the  Corporation  Law  provide  otherwise,  at all  meetings of  shareholders  a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter,  represented in person or
by proxy,  constitutes a quorum for action on the matter. Action may be taken at
a  shareholders'  meeting only on matters with respect to which a quorum exists;
provided,  however,  that any  meeting  of  shareholders,  including  annual and
special meetings and any adjournments  thereof, may be adjourned to a later date
although  less than a quorum is  present.  Once a share is  represented  for any
purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder
of the meeting  and for any meeting  held  pursuant  to an  adjournment  of that
meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.

      Section  1.6 Vote  Required  to Take  Action.  If a quorum  exists as to a
matter to be  considered  at a meeting of  shareholders,  action on such  matter
(other than the election of  Directors)  is approved if the votes  properly cast
favoring the action exceed the votes  properly cast opposing the action,  unless
the  Corporation's  Articles of  Incorporation  or the Corporation Law require a
greater number of affirmative  votes.  Directors shall be elected by a plurality
of the votes properly cast.

      Section 1.7 Record Date.  Only such persons shall be entitled to notice or
to vote, in person or by proxy, at any shareholders'  meeting as shall appear as
shareholders  upon the books of the  Corporation  as of such  record date as the
Board of Directors shall determine,  which date may not be earlier than the date
seventy (70) days immediately  preceding the meeting unless otherwise  permitted
by the Corporation  Law. In the absence of such  determination,  the record date
shall be the fiftieth (50th) day immediately preceding the date of such meeting.
Unless  otherwise  provided  by the Board of  Directors,  shareholders  shall be
determined as of the close of business on the record date.

      Section 1.8 Proxies. A shareholder may vote his shares either in person or
by proxy.  A  shareholder  may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise  act for the
shareholder  (including authorizing the proxy to receive, or to waive, notice of
any shareholders' meetings within the effective period of such proxy) by signing
an appointment form, either personally or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact.
An  appointment  of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other
officer or agent  authorized to tabulate  votes and is effective for eleven (11)
months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form. The
proxy's  authority may be limited to a particular  meeting or may be general and
authorize the proxy to represent the  shareholder  at a meeting of  shareholders
held within the time provided in the appointment form. An appointment of a proxy
is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states
that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.  Subject
to the  Corporation Law and to any express  limitation on the proxy's  authority
appearing on the face of the  appointment  form, the  Corporation is entitled to
accept the proxy's  vote or other action as that of the  shareholder  making the
appointment.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                    DIRECTORS

      Section  2.1 Number and Term.  The  business of the  Corporation  shall be
managed by a Board of Directors consisting of at least six Directors and no more
than twelve Directors. The exact number of Directors of the Corporation shall be
fixed by the Board of Directors  within the range  established  by the preceding
sentence, and may be changed within that range from time to time by the Board of
Directors.  Each Director shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the
annual  meeting  of  shareholders  next  following  his  election.  Despite  the
expiration of a Director's  term, the Director shall continue to serve until his
successor  is  elected  and  qualified  or  until  the  earlier  of  his  death,
resignation,  disqualification,  or removal, or until there is a decrease in the
number of Directors. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors,  from whatever cause
arising,  including  any increase in the size of the Board of Directors as fixed
by the Board of  Directors,  shall be filled by  selection  of a successor  by a
majority vote of the remaining  members of the Board of Directors  (even if less
than a quorum);  provided,  however, that if such vacancy or vacancies leave the
Board of Directors  with no members or if the remaining  members of the Board of
Directors  are unable to agree upon a  successor  or  determine  not to select a
successor, such vacancy may be filled by a vote of the shareholders at a special
meeting called for that purpose or at the next annual  meeting of  shareholders.
The term of a Director elected or selected to fill a vacancy shall expire at the
end of the term for which such Director's predecessor was elected.

      The  Directors  and  each of them  shall  have no  authority  to bind  the
Corporation  except when acting as a Board of Directors or as a committee of the
Board of Directors to the extent permitted in Section 2.7 hereof.

      A majority of the members of the Board of  Directors  may elect from among
its  members  a  Chairman  of  the  Board  or up to  two  members  to be  each a
Co-Chairman  of the  Board.  The  Chairman  of the Board  shall  preside  at all
meetings of the  shareholders and the Board of Directors at which he is present.
In  addition,  the  Chairman  of the Board shall have and may  exercise  all the
powers and duties that are  incident to his position  that are  delegated to him
from time to time by the Board of Directors. Each Co-Chairman of the Board shall
have and may  exercise  all the powers and duties that a single  Chairman of the
Board could have or exercise,  and any reference to Chairman of the Board herein
shall, if applicable, include each Co-Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the
Board may be an officer of the Corporation.

      Section 2.2 Quorum and Vote Required to Take Action. At least one third of
the  whole  Board of  Directors  (the  size of  which  shall  be  determined  in
accordance with the latest action of the Board of Directors fixing the number of
Directors)  shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any
business, except the filling of vacancies. If a quorum is present when a vote is
taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors  present shall be the
act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by
the  Corporation  Law, the  Corporation's  Articles of  Incorporation,  or these
Bylaws.

      Section 2.3 Annual and Regular Meetings. The Board of Directors shall meet
annually,  without  notice,  on  the  same  day  as the  annual  meeting  of the
shareholders,  for the purpose of transacting such business as properly may come
before  the  meeting.  Other  regular  meetings  of the Board of  Directors,  in
addition to said meeting, may be held without notice of the date, time, place or
purpose of the  meeting or on such dates,  at such times,  and at such places as
shall be fixed by  resolution  adopted by the Board of  Directors  or  otherwise
communicated to the Directors.  The Board of Directors may at any time alter the
date for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

      Section 2.4 Special  Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be  called  by any  member  of the  Board of  Directors  upon not less  than
twenty-four  (24) hours'  notice  given to each  Director of the date,  time and
place of the  meeting,  which notice need not specify the purpose or purposes of
the  special  meeting.  Such  notice may be  communicated  in person  (either in
writing or orally), by telephone,  telegraph,  teletype or other form of wire or
wireless  communication or by mail, and shall be effective at the earlier of the
time of its receipt or, if mailed,  five (5) days after its  mailing.  Notice of
any  meeting of the Board of  Directors  may be waived in writing at any time if
the waiver is signed by the  Director  entitled  to the notice and is filed with
the minutes or corporate records. A Director's attendance at or participation in
a meeting waives any required notice to the Director of the meeting,  unless the
Director  at the  beginning  of the  meeting (or  promptly  upon the  Director's
arrival)  objects to holding the meeting or transacting  business at the meeting
and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.

      Section 2.5 Written Consents. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board of Directors  may be taken  without a meeting if the
action is taken by all  members of the Board of  Directors.  The action  must be
evidenced  by one (1) or more  written  consents  describing  the action  taken,
signed by each Director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate
records  reflecting  the action  taken.  Action  taken under this Section 2.5 is
effective when the last Director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies
a different  prior or  subsequent  effective  date,  in which case the action is
effective on or as of the  specified  date. A consent  signed under this Section
2.5 has the  effect  of a  meeting  vote  and  may be  described  as such in any
document.

      Section 2.6 Participation by Conference Telephone.  The Board of Directors
may permit any or all Directors to participate  in a regular or special  meeting
by, or  through  the use of,  any  means of  communication,  such as  conference
telephone,  by which all Directors  participating may  simultaneously  hear each
other during the meeting.  A Director  participating  in a meeting by such means
shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

      Section 2.7 Committees.

      (a) The Board of  Directors  may  create  one (1) or more  committees  and
appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on them, by resolution of the
Board of Directors adopted by a majority of all the Directors in office when the
resolution is adopted.  Each committee may have one (1) or more members, and all
the  members  of a  committee  shall  serve  at the  pleasure  of the  Board  of
Directors.

      (b) To the extent  specified by the Board of Directors in the  resolutions
creating a committee,  each  committee  may exercise all of the authority of the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that a committee may not:

            (1)  authorize  dividends or other  distributions  as defined by the
      Corporation   Law,   except  a  committee   may  authorize  or  approve  a
      reacquisition  of  shares  if  done  according  to  a  formula  or  method
      prescribed by the Board of Directors;

            (2) approve or propose to shareholders action that is required to be
      approved by shareholders;

            (3)  fill  vacancies  on the  Board  of  Directors  or on any of its
committees;

            (4)   amend the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation;

            (5) adopt, amend, repeal, or waive provision of these Bylaws, or

            (6) approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval.

      (c)  Except to the extent  inconsistent  with the  resolutions  creating a
committee,  Section 2.1 thorough  2.6 of these  Bylaws,  which govern  meetings,
action  without  meetings,  notice  and  waiver of  notice,  quorum  and  voting
requirements,  and telephone participation in meetings of the Board of Directors
apply to the committee and its members as well.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                    OFFICERS

      Section  3.1  Designation,  Selection,  and  Terms.  The  officers  of the
Corporation  shall  consist of the  President  and the  Secretary.  The Board of
Directors may also elect Vice Presidents,  Assistant  Secretaries,  a Treasurer,
Assistant  Treasurers,  and such other officers or assistant  officers as it may
from time to time  determine by resolution  creating the office and defining the
duties thereof.  In addition,  the President may, from time to time,  create and
appoint  such  assistant  officers as he deems  desirable.  The  officers of the
Corporation  shall be elected by the Board of  Directors  (or  appointed  by the
President as provided  above) and need not be selected from among the members of
the  Board of  Directors.  Any two (2) or more  offices  may be held by the same
person.  All officers shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors and,
with  respect to officers  appointed by the  President,  also at the pleasure of
such officer.  The election or  appointment of an officer does not itself create
contract rights.

      Section 3.2 Removal and  Vacancies.  The Board of Directors may remove any
officer at any time with or without cause. An officer appointed by the President
may also be  removed  at any  time,  with or  without  cause,  by such  officer.
Vacancies  in such  offices,  however  occurring,  may be filled by the Board of
Directors at any meeting of the Board of  Directors  (or by  appointment  by the
President, to the extent provided in Section 3.1 of these Bylaws).

      Section 3.3 President.  The  President,  who need not be chosen from among
the Directors, shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and shall
have  general  and  active,  executive  management  of  the  operations  of  the
Corporation,  subject,  however,  to the control of the Board of  Directors.  He
shall,  in general,  perform all duties  incident to the office of President and
such other  duties as from time to time may be  assigned  to him by the Board of
Directors.

      Section 3.4 Secretary.  The Secretary shall be the custodian of the books,
papers,  and records of the  Corporation  and of its corporate seal, if any, and
shall be  responsible  for seeing  that the  Corporation  maintains  the records
required by the  Corporation  Law (other than  accounting  records) and that the
Corporation files with the Indiana Secretary of State the annual report required
by the Corporation Law. The Secretary shall be responsible for preparing minutes
of the  meetings  of the  shareholders  and of the  Board of  Directors  and for
authenticating records of the Corporation, and he shall perform all of the other
duties usual in the office of the Secretary of a corporation.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                     CHECKS

      All checks,  drafts,  or other orders for payment of money shall be signed
in the  name  of the  Corporation  by such  officers  or  persons  as  shall  be
designated from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and
included in the minute book of the Corporation.

                                    ARTICLE V
                                      LOANS

      Such of the officers of the  Corporation as shall be designated  from time
to time by any resolution  adopted by the Board of Directors and included in the
minute  book of the  Corporation  shall  have the power,  with such  limitations
thereon  as may be  fixed by the  Board of  Directors,  to  borrow  money in the
Corporation's  behalf,  to establish  credit,  to discount bills and papers,  to
pledge  collateral,  and to execute such notices,  bonds,  debentures,  or other
evidences  of  indebtedness,  and such  mortgage,  trust  indentures,  and other
instruments in connection  therewith,  as may be authorized from time to time by
such Board of Directors.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                             EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS

      The President,  or any officer designed by him, may, in the  Corporation's
name,  sign all  deeds,  leases,  contracts,  or similar  documents  that may be
authorized by the Board of Directors unless  otherwise  directed by the Board of
Directors  or  otherwise  provided  herein or in the  Corporation's  Articles of
Incorporation, or as otherwise required by law.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                      STOCK

      Section 7.1 Execution. Certificates for shares of the capital stock of the
Corporation  shall be signed  (either  manually or in facsimile) by two officers
designated  from  time to time by the  Board  of  Directors  and the seal of the
Corporation  (or a  facsimile  thereof),  if any,  may be thereto  affixed.  The
Corporation may issue and deliver any such certificate  notwithstanding that any
such officer who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature shall have been
imprinted on, such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer.

      Section 7.2 Contents. Each certificate shall state on its face the name of
the Corporation and that it is organized under the laws of the State of Indiana,
the name of the  person to whom it is  issued,  and the number and class and the
designation of the series,  if any, of shares the certificate  represents,  and,
whenever the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of shares or
different series within a class, each certificate issued after the effectiveness
of such  authorization  shall further state  conspicuously  on its front or back
that the Corporation will furnish the shareholder,  upon his written request and
without charge, a summary of the designations, relative rights, preferences, and
limitations  applicable  to each class and series and the authority of the Board
of Directors to determine variations in rights,  preferences and limitations for
future series.

      Section  7.3  Transfers.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law  or  by
resolution of the Board of  Directors,  transfers of shares of the capital stock
of the  Corporation  shall be made only on the books of the  Corporation  by the
holder thereof in person or by duly authorized attorney, on payment of all taxes
thereon and surrender for  cancellation of the  certificate or certificates  for
such shares (except as hereinafter provided in the case of loss, destruction, or
mutilation  of  certificates)   properly  endorsed  by  the  holder  thereof  or
accompanied by the proper  evidence of succession,  assignment,  or authority to
transfer and delivered to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

      Section 7.4 Stock Transfer Records.  There shall be entered upon the stock
records of the Corporation the number of each certificate  issued;  the name and
address of the  registered  holder of such  certificate;  the number,  kind, and
class or series of shares  represented by such  certificate;  the date of issue;
whether the shares are originally  issued or transferred;  the registered holder
from whom transferred;  and such other information as is commonly required to be
shown by such records. The stock records of the Corporation shall be kept at its
principal office, unless the Corporation appoints a transfer agent or registrar,
in which case the Corporation  shall keep at its principal office a complete and
accurate  shareholders'  list giving the name and addresses of all  shareholders
and the  number  and  class of  shares  held by  each.  If a  transfer  agent is
appointed by the  Corporation,  shareholders  shall give  written  notice of any
change in their addresses from time to time to the transfer agent.

      Section 7.5 Transfer  Agents and  Registrars.  The Board of Directors  may
appoint one or more transfer  agents and one or more  registrars and may require
each stock certificate to bear the signature of either or both.

      Section 7.6 Loss, Destruction,  or Mutilation of Certificates.  The holder
of any of the capital  stock of the  Corporation  shall  immediately  notify the
Corporation of any loss, destruction, or mutilation of the certificate therefor,
and the Board of Directors may, in its  discretion,  cause to be issued to him a
new  certificate  or  certificates  of stock upon the surrender of the mutilated
certificate, or, in the case of loss or destruction,  upon satisfactory proof of
such loss or destruction. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require
the holder of the lost or destroyed  certificate or his legal  representative to
give the  Corporation a bond in such sum and in such form,  and with such surety
or sureties as it may direct, to indemnify the Corporation, its transfer agents,
and its registrars,  if any,  against any claim that may be made against them or
any of them with respect to the capital stock  represented by the certificate or
certificates alleged to have been lost or destroyed,  but the Board of Directors
may, in its discretion,  refuse to issue a new certificate or certificate,  save
upon the order of a court having jurisdiction in such matters.

      Section 7.7 Form of Certificates. The form of the certificate of shares of
the  capital  stock of the  Corporation  shall  conform to the  requirements  of
Section 7.2 of these  Bylaws and be in such  printed  form as shall from time to
time be approved by resolution of the Board of Directors.

      Section 7.8 Direct Registration  System.  Nothing in these Bylaws shall be
construed as limiting the  authority of the Board of Directors of the Company to
authorize a direct  registration system whereby the registration of the issuance
and transfer of any or all of the shares of any or all classes of capital  stock
of the  Company  (or of any or all series of such  shares) may be entered in the
Company's  stock records in book-entry form without the issuance of certificates
therefor.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                      SEAL

      The corporate seal of the Corporation  shall, if the Corporation elects to
have  one,  be in the form of a disc,  with the name of the  Corporation  on the
periphery  thereof  and the word  "SEAL" in the  center.  However,  the use of a
corporate seal or an impression  thereof is not required and does not affect the
validity of any instrument whatsoever.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      Section 9.1  Corporation  Law. The  provision of the  Corporation  Law, as
amended, applicable to all matters relevant to, but not specifically covered by,
these Bylaws are hereby, by reference,  incorporated in and made a part of these
Bylaws.

      Section 9.2 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the  Corporation  shall end 
on the 30th of September of each year.

      Section 9.3 Business Combination Chapter Applicable. The provisions of the
Business  Combinations Chapter of the Corporation Law (Indiana Code 23-1-43) are
applicable to the Corporation.  The provisions of the Control Shares Acquisition
Chapter of the  Corporation  Law  (Indiana  Code  23-1-42) are  inapplicable  to
"control share acquisitions" (as therein defined) of shares of the Corporation.

      Section 9.4 Definition of Articles of Incorporation. The term "Articles of
Incorporation"  as used in these Bylaws means the Articles of  Incorporation  of
the Corporation, as amended and restated from time to time.

      Section  9.5  Amendments.  These  Bylaws  may be  rescinded,  changed,  or
amended,  and  provisions  hereof may be waived,  at any meeting of the Board of
Directors by the affirmative  vote of a majority of the number of Directors then
in  office  at the  time,  except as  otherwise  required  by the  Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation or by the Corporation Law.
