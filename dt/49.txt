                                    A. AMERCO

     AMERCO, a Nevada corporation (AMERCO), is the holding company for U-Haul
International, Inc. (U-Haul), Amerco Real Estate Company (Real Estate), Republic
Western Insurance Company (RepWest) and Oxford Life Insurance Company (Oxford).
Throughout this Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, the term
"AMERCO" includes all of its subsidiaries.  AMERCO's executive offices are
located at 1325 Airmotive Way, Suite 100, Reno, Nevada 89502-3239, and the
telephone number is (775) 688-6300.  As used in this Form 10-K, all references
to a fiscal year refer to AMERCO's fiscal year ended March 31 of that year.
RepWest and Oxford are consolidated on the basis of calendar years ended
December 31.  Accordingly, all references to the years 2000, 1999 and 1998
correspond to AMERCO's fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  AMERCO
has four industry segments represented by Moving and Storage Operations
(U-Haul), Real Estate, Property and Casualty Insurance (RepWest) and Life
Insurance (Oxford).  See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for financial information regarding the industry segments.

Moving and Storage Operations
     Moving and self-storage operations consist of the rental of trucks and
trailers, the sale of moving aids such as boxes and the rental of self-storage
spaces to the do-it-yourself mover.  Operations are conducted using the
registered tradename U-Haul REGISTERED TRADEMARK throughout the United States
and Canada.

Real Estate Operations
     Real Estate owns approximately 90% of U-Haul's real estate assets,
including U-Haul Center and Storage locations.  The remainder of the real estate
assets are owned by various U-Haul entities.  Real Estate is responsible for
managing all of the properties including the environmental risks of the
properties.  Real Estate is responsible for the purchase of all properties used
by AMERCO or any of its subsidiaries.  Real Estate also handles all the
dispositions (sale or lease) of unused real estate.

Property and Casualty Insurance
     RepWest originates and reinsures property and casualty-type insurance
products for various market participants, including independent third parties,
U-Haul's customers, independent dealers and AMERCO.

Life Insurance
     Oxford originates and reinsures annuities, credit life and disability, life
insurance and supplemental health products.  Oxford also administers the self-
insured employee health and dental plans for AMERCO.

     On November 13, 2000, Oxford acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (CFLIC) in an exchange of
cash for stock.  CFLIC is a Texas-based insurance company specializing in
providing supplemental health insurance and is licensed in 31 states.  The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, CFLIC's results of operations have been included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.  Oxford
funded the acquisition from available cash and short-term funds.


                                   B. HISTORY

     U-Haul was founded in 1945 under the name "U-Haul Trailer Rental Company".
From 1945 to 1974, U-Haul rented trailers and, starting in 1959, trucks on a
one-way and In-Town REGISTERD TRADEMARK basis through independent dealers.
Since 1974, U-Haul has developed a network of Company owned rental centers
(U-Haul Centers) through which U-Haul rents its trucks and trailers and
provides related products and services (e.g., the sale and installation of
hitches, as well as the sale of boxes and moving supplies).  At March 31, 2001,
U-Haul's distribution network included 1,380 U-Haul Centers and 15,300
independent dealers.
<PAGE>  4
                        C. MOVING AND STORAGE OPERATIONS

Business Strategies
     The U-Haul business strategy remains focused on do-it-yourself moving and
self-storage customers.  U-Haul believes that customer access, in terms of truck
or trailer availability and proximity of rental locations, is critical to its
success.  Under the U-Haul name, our strategy is to offer, in an integrated
manner over an extensive and geographically diverse network of 16,680 Company
operated Centers and independent dealers, a wide range of products and services
to do-it-yourself moving and self-storage customers.

Moving Operations
     U-Haul has a variety of product offerings.  Rental trucks are designed with
do-it-yourself customers in mind.  U-Haul trailers are suited to the low profile
of many newly manufactured automobiles.  As of March 31, 2001, the U-Haul rental
equipment fleet consisted of 100,400 trucks, 85,300 trailers and 20,400 tow
dollies.  Additionally, U-Haul provides support rental items such as furniture
pads and bumper hitches.

     Approximately 90% of U-Haul's rental revenue is from do-it-yourself movers.
Moving rentals include:
     (i)  In-Town REGISTERD TRADEMARK rentals, where the equipment is returned
          to the originating U-Haul location and
     (ii) one-way rentals, where the equipment is returned to a U-Haul location
          in another city.

     U-Haul's truck and trailer rental business tends to be seasonal, with
proportionally more transactions and revenues generated in the spring and summer
months than during the balance of the year.

     U-Haul also sells a wide selection of moving supplies that include boxes,
tape and packaging materials.  U-Haul Centers also sell and install hitches and
towing systems, and sell propane.

     U-Haul offers protection packages such as:
     (i)  Safemove REGISTERED TRADEMARK - which provides moving customers with
          a damage waiver, cargo protection and medical and life coverage; and,
     (ii) Safestor REGISTERED TRADEMARK - which provides self-storage rental
          customers with various types of protection for their goods in storage.

     Independent dealers receive U-Haul equipment on a consignment basis and are
paid a commission on gross revenues generated from their rentals. U-Haul
maintains contracts with its independent dealers that may typically be
terminated upon 30 days written notice by either party.

     U-Haul designs and manufactures its truck van boxes, trailers and various
other support rental equipment items.  Truck chassis are manufactured by both
foreign and domestic truck manufacturers.  These chassis receive certain post-
delivery modifications and are joined with van boxes at strategically located
Company-owned manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United States.

     U-Haul services and maintains its trucks and trailers through an extensive
preventive-maintenance program, generally performed at Company-owned facilities
located at or near U-Haul Centers.  Major repairs are performed either by the
chassis manufacturers' dealers or by Company-owned repair shops, and U-Haul
takes advantage of manufacturers' warranties.

Competition
     The moving truck and trailer rental market is highly competitive and
dominated by national operators in both the In-Town REGISTERED TRADEMARK and
one-way markets.  Recently two major competitors combined.  Budget Rent-A-Car
acquired Ryder TRS (Ryder Truck Rentals).  Management believes that this merger
will not have a material adverse effect on AMERCO's financial position or
operating results.  Management believes that there are two distinct users of
rental trucks:  commercial users and do-it-yourself users.  U-Haul focuses on
the do-it-yourself mover.  U-Haul believes that the principal competitive
factors are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental
equipment and price.
<PAGE>   5

Self-Storage Business
     U-Haul entered the self-storage business in 1974 and since then has
increased the rentable square footage of its storage locations through the
acquisition of existing facilities and new construction.  In addition, U-Haul
has entered into management agreements to manage self-storage properties owned
by others.  U-Haul has also entered into a strategic and financial partnership
with Private Mini Storage Realty, L.P., a Texas-based operator of self-storage
properties.

     Through over 1,000 owned or managed storage locations in the United States
and Canada, U-Haul offers for rent more than 32.5 million square feet of self-
storage space.  U-Haul's self-storage facility locations range in sizes up to
152,600 square feet of storage space, with individual storage units in sizes
from 15 square feet to 400 square feet.

     The primary market for storage rooms is the storage of household goods.
With the addition of 32,784 storage rooms during fiscal year 2001, the average
occupancy rate of facilities operating over one year was 83.19%, with modest
seasonal variations.  During fiscal year 2001, delinquent rentals as a
percentage of total storage rentals were approximately 7.7%.  U-Haul considers
this rate to be satisfactory.

Competition
     The primary competition for a U-Haul self-storage location is other storage
facilities within a trade area offering a comparable level of convenience to the
customer.

Employees
     As of March 31, 2001, U-Haul's non-seasonal work force consisted of 16,800
full and part-time employees.

                            D. REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS

Real Estate Operations
     Real Estate has responsibility for actively marketing properties available
for sale or lease.  Real Estate is also responsible for managing any
environmental risks associated with AMERCO's real estate.

Environmental Matters
     Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local
governments significantly affects Real Estate's business operations.  Among
other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the
water, air and land and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances.
Real Estate is aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on the properties.
Real Estate regularly makes capital and operating expenditures to stay in
compliance with environmental laws.  Since 1988, Real Estate has managed a
testing and removal program for underground storage tanks.  Under this program,
over 3,000 tanks have been removed at a cost of $42.6 million.

     A subsidiary of U-Haul, INW Company (INW), owns one property located within
two different state hazardous substance sites in the State of Washington.  The
sites are referred to as the "Yakima Valley Spray Site" and the "Yakima Railroad
Area."  INW has been named as a "potentially liable party" (PLP) under state law
with respect to this property as it relates to both sites. As a result of the
cleanup costs of approximately $3.0 to $9.0 million required by the State of
Washington, INW filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy laws in
May of 2001.

     Based upon the information currently available to Real Estate, compliance
with the environmental laws and its share of the costs of investigation and
cleanup of known hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on AMERCO's financial position or operating results.

                             E. INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Business Strategies
     RepWest's principal business strategy is to provide specialty insurance for
personal, commercial and reinsurance markets.  RepWest focuses on selected
regional and under-served customers through managing general agents, independent
agents, brokers and direct sales.

     Oxford's business strategy is long-term capital growth through direct
writing and reinsuring of annuity, credit life and disability and supplemental
health insurance.  Oxford is pursuing this growth strategy of increased direct
writing via acquisitions of insurance companies, expanded distribution channels
and product development.  The acquisitions of North American Insurance Company
and Safe Mate Life Insurance Company in 1997 and Christian Fidelity Life
Insurance Company in 2000 represent a significant movement toward this long-term
goal.  Oxford has significantly expanded product offerings, distribution
channels and administrative capabilities through these acquisitions.

Investments
     RepWest and Oxford investments must comply with the insurance laws of the
state of domicile.  These laws prescribe the type, quality and concentration of
investments that may be made.  Moreover, in order to be considered an acceptable
reinsurer by cedents and intermediaries, a reinsurer must offer financial
security.  The quality and liquidity of invested assets are important
considerations in determining such security.

     The investment philosophies of RepWest and Oxford emphasize protection of
principal through the purchase of investment grade fixed-income securities.
Approximately 88.0% of RepWest's and 93.2% of Oxford's fixed-income securities
consist of investment grade securities (NAIC-2 or greater).  The maturity
distributions are designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash
needs.

Reinsurance
     RepWest and Oxford assume and cede insurance from and to other insurers and
members of various reinsurance pools and associations.  Reinsurance arrangements
are utilized to provide greater diversification of risk and to minimize exposure
to large risks.  However, the original insurer retains primary liability to the
policyholder should the assuming insurer not be able to meet its obligations
under the reinsurance agreements.

Regulation
     RepWest and Oxford are subject to regulation and supervision throughout the
United States.  The regulation extends to such matters as licensing companies
and agents, restricting the types, quality or quantity of investments,
regulating capital and surplus and actuarial reserve maintenance, setting
solvency standards, filing of annual and other reports on financial position,
and regulating trade practices.  State laws also regulate transactions and
dividends between an insurance company and its parent or affiliates, and
generally require prior approval or notification for any change in control of
the insurance subsidiary.  RepWest's unpaid losses and loss expenses are
certified annually by an independent actuarial consulting firm as required by
state regulation.

     In the past few years, the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework
has been subjected to increased scrutiny by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), federal and state legislatures and insurance
regulators.  These regulators are considering increased regulations, with an
emphasis on insurance company investment and solvency issues.  It is not
possible to predict the future impact of changing state and federal regulations
on the operations of RepWest and Oxford.

     In 1998, the NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
Principles guidance, which will replace the current Accounting Practices and
Procedures manual as the NAIC's primary guidance for statutory accounting as of
January 1, 2001.  The Codification provides guidance for areas where statutory
accounting has been silent and changes current statutory accounting in some
areas.  The Insurance Departments of the State of Arizona and Louisiana has
adopted the Codification guidance, effective January 1, 2001.  The effect of
adoption on RepWest's statutory surplus are increases of approximately
$11,301,000 respectively, as filed in the entities' March 31, 2001 quarterly
statements as a result of a recording of a net deferred tax asset.

     RepWest and Oxford are in compliance with NAIC minimum risk-based
capitalization requirements for insurance companies as of December 31, 2000.

Competition
     The highly competitive insurance industry includes a large number of
property and casualty insurance companies and life insurance companies.  In
addition, the marketplace now includes financial service firms offering both
insurance and financial products.  Some of the insurance companies are owned by
stockholders and others are owned by policyholders (mutual).  Many competitors
have been in business for a longer period of time or possess substantially
greater financial resources.  Competition in the insurance business is based
upon price, product design and services rendered to producers and policyholders.

Employees
     RepWest's non-seasonal work force consists of 394 full and part-time
employees.

     Oxford's non-seasonal work force consists of 227 full and part-time
employees.

Life Insurance
     Oxford offers annuities, credit life and disability, life insurance and
supplemental health insurance products, both as a direct writer and as an
assuming reinsurer.  In addition, Oxford administers self-insured group health
and dental plans for AMERCO.  Reinsurance arrangements are entered into with
unaffiliated reinsurers.

Property and Casualty
     RepWest's business activities consist of three basic areas:  U-Haul, direct
and assumed reinsurance underwriting.  U-Haul underwritings include coverage for
U-Haul customers, independent dealers and employees of AMERCO.  For the year
ended December 31, 2000, approximately 11.4% of RepWest's written premiums
resulted from U-Haul underwriting activities.  RepWest's direct underwriting is
done through company-employed underwriters and selected general agents.  The
products provided include liability coverage for rental vehicle lessees, storage
rental properties, coverage for commercial multiple peril, commercial auto,
mobile homes and excess workers' compensation.  RepWest's assumed reinsurance
underwriting is done via broker markets.  In an effort to decrease risk, RepWest
has entered into various catastrophe cover policies to limit its exposure.

     The liability for reported and unreported losses is based on both RepWest's
historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on
historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.  The
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on estimates
of the amount necessary to settle all claims as of the statement date.  Both
reported and unreported losses are included in the liability.  RepWest updates
the liability estimate as additional facts regarding claim costs become
available.  These estimates are subject to uncertainty and variation due to
numerous factors.  In estimating reserves, no attempt is made to isolate
inflation from the combined effect of other factors including inflation.
Unpaid losses and unpaid loss adjustment expense are not discounted.

     Activity in the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
is summarized as follows:

     As a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years, the
provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (net of reinsurance
recoveries of $36.5 million) increased by $35.3 million in 2000.

suits and claims.  AMERCO is also a party to several administrative proceedings
arising from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or cleanup

     AMERCO has not declared any cash dividends to common stockholders for the
two most recent fiscal years.

     AMERCO does not have a formal dividend policy.  AMERCO's Board of Directors
periodically considers the advisability of declaring and paying dividends in
light of existing circumstances.  AMERCO does not intend to pay dividends in the
foreseeable future.  See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for a discussion of certain statutory restrictions on the ability of
the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to AMERCO.

     See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of AMERCO's non-cash dividends.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of changes to common shares
outstanding.

     The common stock of U-Haul is wholly-owned by AMERCO.  As a result, no
active trading market exists for the purchase and sale of such common stock.  No
cash dividends were declared to AMERCO by U-Haul during the two most recent
fiscal years.

                       CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Statements
- --------------------------
     This report contains forward-looking statements.  Additional written or
oral forward-looking statements may be made by AMERCO from time to time in
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise.  Management
believes such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of the safe-
harbor provisions.  Such statements may include, but not be limited to,
projections of revenues, income or loss, estimates of capital expenditures,
plans for future operations, products or services and financing needs or plans,
as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.  The words "believe",
"expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "project" and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was
made.  Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified.  Future events
and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated
by or underlying the forward-looking statements.  The following disclosures, as
well as other statements in this report and in the Notes to AMERCO's
Consolidated Financial Statements, describe factors, among others, that could
contribute to or cause such differences, or that could affect AMERCO's stock
price.

General
- -------
     Information on fiscal year and industry segments is incorporated by
reference to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1, 20
and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".  The notes discuss the
principles of consolidation, summarized consolidated financial information and
industry segment and geographic area data, respectively.  In consolidation, all
intersegment premiums are eliminated and the benefits, losses and expenses are
retained by the insurance companies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

Consolidated Group
     To meet the needs of its customers, U-Haul must maintain a large inventory
of fixed asset rental items.  At March 31, 2001, net property, plant and
equipment represented approximately 63.1% of total assets from non-insurance
operations and approximately 40.2% of consolidated assets.  In fiscal year
2001, gross capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $358.9
million, as compared to $417.6 million and $298.5 million in fiscal years 2000
and 1999, respectively.  These expenditures primarily reflect the replacement
of certain rental trucks and trailers.  The capital needs required to fund
these acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds from operations
and lease financings.

     During each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
U-Haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately $232
million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation.  This level of capital
expenditures, combined with a potential range of $77.5-$175 million in annual
long-term debt maturities, are expected to create annual average funding needs
of approximately $333-$408 million.  Management estimates that U-Haul will
fund 100% of these requirements with leases and internally generated funds,
including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales.

Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
     Net cash provided by operating activities was $126.1 million, $237.7
million and $159.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Details by material segment follows:

  Moving and Storage Operations
     Cash provided by operating activities was $39.7 million, $147.5 million and
$128.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease
from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001 is mainly due to a decrease in
intercompany payable. The increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 is
partially due to an increase in net income.
<PAGE>  15

  Real Estate Operations
     Cash provided by operating activities was $50.5 million, $24.8 million and
$38.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
in fiscal year 2001, is due to an increase in intercompany payable. This is
due to dividends paid related to the sale of property.  The decrease in
fiscal year 2000, is due to a decrease in the intercompany payable.

  Property and Casualty
     Cash provided (used) by operating activities was $21.1 million, $(11.1)
million and $(21.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The 2000 to 1999 change resulted from increased premium
collections and funds withheld, offset by increased loss and loss adjustment
expense payments and policy acquisition costs associated with new business
production. The 1999 to 1998 change resulted from the increased funds withheld
liability, decreased paid losses recoverable and a smaller decrease in loss and
loss adjustment expense reserves.  This was offset by increased premiums and
agents' balances and the intercompany receivable due from affiliates.

     RepWest's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio
were $17.0 million, $6.0 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.  This balance reflects funds in transition from maturity
proceeds to long-term investments.  This level of liquid assets, combined with
budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet periodic needs.  Capital and operating
budgets allow RepWest to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and
underwriting proceeds.
<PAGE>  16
  LIFE INSURANCE
     Cash provided by operating activities was $8.7 million, $22.2 million and
$34.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2000 and
1999 relates to paid loss experience.  In 2000, cash flows provided by financing
activities were $14.7 million, $3.2 million and $32.0 million for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Cash flows from deferred
annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which are a component of
financing activities, as well as the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a
component of investing activities.  The increase in 2000 from 1999 is due to a
higher ratio of annuity deposits versus withdrawals, the opposite occurred in
1999 compared to 1998.

     Oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest-
sensitive products and investment income.  The primary uses of cash are
operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders.  Matching the investment
portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an
important consideration.  Benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored
to provide projections of future cash requirements.

     In addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a
substantial amount of liquid funds is available through Oxford's short-term
portfolio.  Short-term investments amounted to $45.0 million, $30.7 million and
$63.4 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Management
believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable
cash needs.

Consolidated Stockholder's Equity
     Consolidated stockholder's equity was $615.4, $585.3 and $616.0 million for
the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
follow:

Moving and Storage Operations
     U-Haul's stockholder's equity was $522.9 million, $435.2 million and $384.7
million for the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
in fiscal year 2001 is mainly the result of increased additional paid in capital
due to the sale of property to a related party.  The increase in fiscal year
2000 was due to earnings.

Real Estate Operations
     Real Estate stockholder's equity was $89.1 million, $96.1 million and $79.5
million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in
fiscal year 2001 relates to the payment of a dividend to U-Haul partially
offset by increased earnings.  The increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to
earnings.
<PAGE>  17

   Property and Casualty
     RepWest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily
in bonds at varying maturity levels with 88.0% of the fixed-income securities
consisting of investment grade securities.  The maturity distribution is
designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs.  Current
liquidity remains strong, with current invested assets equal to 81.8% of total
liabilities.

     The liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon both
RepWest's historical and industry averages.  Unpaid loss adjustment expenses are
based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid.
Unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted.

     RepWest's stockholder's equity was $192.1 million, $208.5 million and
$211.4 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The decrease
from 1999 to 2000 is a result of an operating loss and a change in market value
for the available for sale investment portfolio.  RepWest considers current
stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and absorb
unforeseen risk events.  RepWest does not use debt or equity issues to increase
capital and therefore has no exposure to capital market conditions.

   Life Insurance
     Oxford's stockholder's equity was $99.8 million, $88.1 million and $93.6
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 is
a result of earnings and change in market value for the available for sale
investment portfolio.  The decrease from 1998 to 1999 was due to the change in
market value for the available for sale investment portfolio offset by earnings.
Oxford did not pay dividends to its parent during 2000, 1999 or 1998.

Insurance Operations
- --------------------
     Applicable laws and regulations of the State of Arizona require RepWest and
Oxford to maintain minimum capital determined in accordance with statutory
accounting practices.  Such amount is $1.0 million and $0.4 million, for RepWest
and Oxford, respectively.  In addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid
to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled in the State of Arizona is
limited.  Any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory
approval.  Statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without
regulatory approval is $11.7 million and $0.7 million for RepWest and Oxford,
respectively at December 31, 2000.  These restrictions are not expected to have
a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to meet its cash
obligations.  Oxford issued a surplus note to AMERCO on December 31, 1998 for
$10.0 million.  Approval by the Arizona Department of Insurance is required
prior to payment of principal and interest.

Credit Agreements
- -----------------
     AMERCO's operations are funded by various credit and financing
arrangements, including unsecured long-term borrowings, unsecured medium-term
notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.  To finance
its fleet of trucks and trailers, U-Haul routinely enters into sale and
leaseback transactions.  As of March 31, 2001, AMERCO had $1,156.8 million in
total notes and loans outstanding and unutilized committed lines of credit of
approximately $94.9 million.

     Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
additional indebtedness, issuing mandatory repayment preferred stock,
maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its
properties and assets.  At March 31, 2001, AMERCO was in compliance with these
covenants.

     Reference is made to Note 5 in Item 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Results of Operations - Consolidated
- ------------------------------------

Consolidated Rental Revenue
     Rental revenue, net of commission expense was $1,205.0 million, $1,150.5
million, and $1,074.2 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Details by material segment follow:
<PAGE>  18

   Moving and Storage Operations
     Rental revenue was $1,202.4 million, $1,148.2 million and $1,072.1 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase from fiscal
year 2000 to fiscal year 2001 is due to an increase in one way transactions with
an improved average dollar per transaction on one way rentals as well as growth
in transactions in trailer rentals and support rental items.  The increase from
fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 was primarily due to the growth in truck
rental revenues which benefited from transactional growth and reflects a higher
average revenue per transaction.

   Real Estate Operations
     Rental revenue, before intercompany eliminations, were $71.9 million, $73.4
million and $74.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Intercompany rental revenue was $71.1 million, $71.0 million and $71.9 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year
2001 is related to the sale of properties to a related party while rental
revenue was consistent between fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000.

Consolidated Net Sales
     Net sales revenues were $194.3 million, $188.8 million and $181.3 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Revenue growth from the sale
of moving support items (i.e. boxes, etc.) and propane resulted in the increase
for each year.

Consolidated Premiums
     Premium revenues, after intercompany eliminations, were $323.2 million,
$262.1 million and $226.8 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Details by material segment follow:

   Property and Casualty
     Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $218.1 million,
$173.8 million and $145.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.  General agency premiums were $64.3 million, $17.8
million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 was the result of two new agency
programs.  Assumed treaty reinsurance premiums were $83.2 million, $80.7 million
and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  Rental industry revenues were $43.3 million, $50.3 million and
$66.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  This decline was caused by cost measures implemented on the
U-Haul rental industry Business Auto General Liability Policy.

   Life Insurance
     Premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were $112.6 million,
$96.4 million and $94.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.  Oxford increased Medicare supplement premiums through
direct writings and the acquisition of Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company
(CFLIC); these actions increased premiums by $12.5 million and $19.1 million
in 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Premiums from Oxford's life insurance lines
decreased $1.7 million and increased $1.1 million from 2000 and 1999,
respectively due to production fluctuations from year to year.  In the area
of credit insurance, Oxford increased direct writings as well as reduced
the amount ceded to outside reinsurers.  These factors contributed to
a $3.3 million and $6.7 million increase in premium from 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Annuitizations increased by $1.1 million and decreased $3.0
million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Premiums decreased $5.3 million in
1999 due to the sale of NAFCIC.  Other health insurance premiums increased
$1.0 million in 2000 due to a higher reinsurance retention level and decreased
$0.5 million in 1999 due to the elimination of certain NAI health lines.

Consolidated Net Investment and Interest Income
     Net investment and interest income was $91.2 million, $82.2 million and
$73.4 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by
material segment follow:

  Moving and Storage Operations
     Interest income was $27.9 million, $19.5 million and $12.9 million in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in fiscal year
2001 is mainly related to increased storage loan activity.  The increase in
interest during fiscal year 2000 reflects higher average note receivable
balances.
<PAGE>  19

  Real Estate Operations
     Net investment and interest income was $11.0 million, $7.0 million and $4.5
million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in
fiscal year 2001 is related to increased investments.  The increase in fiscal
year 2000 is due to interest income received on notes receivable.

  Property and Casualty
     Net investment income was $29.1 million, $33.0 million and $35.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
reductions are attributable to decreased gains and lower annual average invested
assets, as well as the write down of $3.0 million of fixed maturity investments
during 2000.

  Life Insurance
     Net investment income was $22.2 million, $21.5 million and $20.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  This
increase is due to improved interest rate spreads on the retirement savings
products offset by write downs of $3.5 million of fixed maturity investments
during 2000.

Consolidated Operating Expenses
     Operating expenses were $998.8 million, $919.1 million and $877.6 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
follow:

   Moving and Storage Operations
     Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $986.5 million,
$931.1 million and $893.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increased expense in fiscal year 2001 is due to increased
personnel cost, higher repair expense, a substantial lawsuit settlement and
other administrative costs.  Also, the addition of storage rooms will initially
cause an increase in operating expenses without corresponding increases in
earnings until the properties reach a stabilized level of occupancy.  The
increase in fiscal year 2000 is due to the increased cost of liability
insurance, due to transactional growth, increased personnel costs and other
administrative costs.

   Real Estate Operations
     Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $0.4 million,
$4.0 million and $6.2 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The decrease in fiscal year 2001 is due to an increase in intercompany lease
payments which lowers their operating expense.  Real Estate benefited from a
reduction in intercompany management fees charged by an affiliated segment
company during fiscal year 2000 compared to the prior two years.

  Property and Casualty
     Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $56.7 million,
$35.0 million and $35.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.  The increase is due to commission expenses associated with
the growth in written premium and a $4.6 million decrease in the capitalization
of deferred acquisition costs for the year ended December 2000 as well as
general and administrative expenses required to support the new business
expansion.  Commission expenses were $33.1 million, $19.1 million and $18.8
million for the years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Lease expenses increased to $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the
years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  All other underwriting
expenses consisted of $21.4 million, $13.9 million and $15.5 million for the
years ended December 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

   Life Insurance
     Operating expenses, before intercompany eliminations, were $29.0 million,
$23.1 million and $20.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.  Commissions have increased $7.3 million and $9.1 million
in 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily due to the increase in Medicare
supplement premiums.  General and administrative expenses net of fees collected
decreased $1.4 million and $0.5 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Consolidated Cost of Sales
     Cost of sales was $117.2 million, $112.0 million and $106.8 million in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Increased material costs and a
higher sales volume related to moving support items contributed to the increases
in both fiscal years 2001 and 2000.

Consolidated Benefits and Losses
     Benefits and losses were $283.4 million, $209.6 million and $176.6 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
follow:

   Property and Casualty
     Benefits and losses incurred were $204.1 million, $150.5 million and $118.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
increase from 1999 to 2000 resulted from two new general agency programs and
reserve strengthening in existing rental industry, assumed treaty reinsurance
and general agency programs.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the
increased assumed treaty reinsurance claims as well as an arbitration loss.  The
arbitration loss caused $6.3 million of previously ceded reserves to be brought
back into RepWest's retention.
<PAGE>  21

   Life Insurance
     Benefits incurred were $79.2 million, $59.0 million and $57.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The increase
is primarily due to Medicare supplement benefits incurred, which accounts for
$16.7 million and $21.2 million of benefit increases in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  These increases are due to larger volumes of business and poor
experience on blocks no longer actively marketed.  Credit insurance
benefits increased from $2.1 million and $2.8 million in 2000 and 1999,
respectively due to the increase in volume written and retained.  Benefits from
other health lines increased $2.5 million and $0.5 million in 2000 and 1999,
respectively as volume increased and loss experience worsened.  Annuity and life
benefits decreased $1.1 million and $2.1 million in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The sale of NAFCIC reduced benefits $0.9 million from 1998.

Consolidated Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
     Amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and the value of business
acquired (VOBA) was $35.9 million, $35.0 million and $31.7 million in fiscal
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  DAC consists of commissions and other
policy acquisition costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the
production of new business.  The prior year end commissions and other related
expenses are recognized ratably over the remainder of the policy year.  Details
by material segment follow:

   Property and Casualty
     The prior year-end commissions and other related expenses are amortized
over the following year.  The amortization expense was $16.3 million, $13.4
million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 is mainly due to the amortization
of Assumed Treaty expenses that were deferred in the 1999 year.  The increase
from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to RepWest's subsidiary company's DAC expense,
which increased to $3.8 million from $0.2 million in 1998.  This was due to a
change in classification of the amortization expense of the subsidiary to
RepWest capitalization.

   Life Insurance
     The VOBA asset relates to the future profits of insurance policies in
force at the date of the NAI and CFLIC acquisitions.  Amortization of DAC and
VOBA was $19.6 million, $21.6 million and $24.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  These costs are amortized as
the premium is earned over the term of the policy.  Amortization decreased $2.0
million from 1999 due to the annuity and credit segments and decreased $3.0
million from 1998 due to the sale of NAFCIC.

Consolidated Lease Expense
     Lease expense was $178.5 million, $136.0 million and $118.7 million in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material segment
follow:

   Moving and Storage Operations
     Lease expense was $166.2 million, $132.4 million and $118.4 million in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The continued increase reflects
additional leasing activity of rental equipment.

   Real Estate Operations
     Lease expense before intercompany eliminations, for real estate
operations was $11.6 million, $3.0 million and $0.1 million for the fiscal
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The continued increase in fiscal
year 2001 and fiscal year 2000 over the prior years reflects payments under
an operating lease facility with a number of financial institutions whereby
the Company is both lessee and construction agent developing storage
properties.
<PAGE>  22

Consolidated Depreciation Expense, net
     Depreciation expense, net was $88.1 million, $87.6 million and $73.1
million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material
segment follow:

   Moving and Storage Operations
     Depreciation expense, net was $82.7 million, $79.0 million and $61.0
million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 reflects an increase in depreciation expense
on the rental truck fleet.

   Real Estate Operations
     Depreciation expense, net was $5.3 million, $8.6 million and $12.0 million
in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year
2001 reflects an increase in gains from the disposition of property, plant and
equipment.  The decrease in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase in gains from
the disposition of property, plant and equipment and a decrease in depreciation
on buildings and non-rental equipment.

Consolidated Earnings from Operations
     Earnings from operations were $111.8 million, $184.3 million and $171.3
million  in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Details by material
segment follow:

   Moving and Storage Operations
     Earnings from operations, before intercompany eliminations, were $73.7
million, $102.0 million and $87.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decrease in fiscal year 2001 is due to increased
transactions, offset by increased operating and lease expenses.  In fiscal year
2000, increased rental transactions, offset by corresponding expenses,
contributed to the earnings gain.

   Real Estate Operations
     Earnings from operations, before intercompany eliminations, were $65.8
million, $64.7 million and $60.3 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increase in fiscal year 2001 is mainly related to higher net
investment interest income.  A decrease in intercompany management fees charged
contributed to the earnings increase for fiscal year 2000.

   Property and Casualty
     Earnings (loss) from operations were $(29.9) million, $7.9 million and
$19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The decrease in 2000 was due to reserve strengthening and
losses on two new general agency programs as well as the write downs of fixed
maturity investments whose declines in value were determined to be other than
temporary.  The 1998 to 1999 decrease resulted mainly from RepWest's writing
off the 1995 American Bonding receivable, lower than forecasted premium volume
in 1999 and higher than expected losses on the agricultural business.

   Life Insurance
     Earnings from operations were $7.0 million, $14.2 million and $12.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The
decrease in 2000 from both 1999 and 1998 was due to write downs of fixed
maturity investments whose declines in value were determined to be other than
temporary and poor Medicare supplement loss experience.  The increase in
earnings from 1998 to 1999 was due to improved investment returns and improved
loss experience on the credit insurance business.

Consolidated Interest Expense
     Interest expense was $87.8 million, $81.5 million and $73.7 million in
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase can be attributed
to an increase in the average cost of debt in fiscal year 2001 over the past two
fiscal years.  The average debt level outstanding continued to increase in
fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal years 2000 and 1999.

Consolidated Extraordinary Loss on the Extinguishment of Debt

     During fiscal year 2001, AMERCO extinguished $100.0 million of 6.89% Bond
Backed Asset Trust certificates (BATs) originally due in fiscal year 2011 and
$25.0 million of 6.7% Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year 2009.
This resulted in an extraordinary loss of $2.1 million, net of tax of $1.2
million ($0.10 per share).

     During fiscal year 2000, AMERCO extinguished $100.0 million of 6.65% Bond
Backed Asset Trust certificates (BATs) originally due in fiscal year 2030 and
$50.0 million of 7.05% to 7.10% Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year
2007.  This resulted in an extraordinary loss of $0.3 million, net of tax of
$0.2 million ($0.02 per share).


Consolidated Earnings
     As a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled $24.0 million, $102.7
million and $97.6 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
After providing for income taxes, earnings from operations were $15.1 million,
$65.8 million and $62.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Following deductions for an extraordinary loss from the early
extinguishment of debt, net earnings were $13.0 million, $65.5 million and $62.5
million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Quarterly Results
     The table on page 24 presents unaudited quarterly results for the eight
quarters in the period beginning April 1, 1999 and ending March 31, 2001.
The Income Statement amounts for the quarter ended December 31, 2000 have
been restated to increase the net loss by $.10 per share due to necessary
revisions of certain fixed asset transactions.  The restated loss per share
was $1.05 for the third quarter fiscal year 2001 as compared to $.95 as
reported.  AMERCO believes that all necessary adjustments have been included
in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, the selected quarterly information
when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
incorporated herein by reference.  U-Haul moving and storage operations are
seasonal and proportionally more of AMERCO's revenues and net earnings from
its U-Haul moving and storage operations are generated in the first and second
quarters of each fiscal year (April through September).  The operating results
for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for any
future period.

Stockholder Litigation
     AMERCO has deducted for income tax purposes approximately $372.0 million of
the payments made to former shareholders in a stockholder lawsuit.  While AMERCO
believes that such income tax deductions are appropriate, there can be no
assurance that such deductions ultimately will be allowed in full.  Reference is
made to Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of the stockholder litigation.

Other
     New pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
adopted during the year are not material to the consolidated financial
statements of AMERCO.  Further, pronouncements with future effective dates are
either not applicable or not material to the consolidated financial statements
of AMERCO.

      ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk
     In the normal course of business, AMERCO is exposed to fluctuations in
interest rates.  AMERCO manages such exposure by the use of a variety of
derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent.  AMERCO does not enter
into leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.  The exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to debt obligations.  AMERCO's objective is to mitigate the
impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  AMERCO uses
interest rate swap agreements to provide for matching the gain or loss
recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the
fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or the
earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.  See Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  A fluctuation of the interest rate
by 100 basis points would change AMERCO's interest expense by $1.0 million.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
     AMERCO's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign
currency exchange rates.  Approximately 2.0% of AMERCO's revenue is generated in
Canada.  The result of a uniform 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material.  AMERCO does not
typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered
material.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                       ---------------------------------



To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of AMERCO

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 28 of this Form 10-K present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of AMERCO and its subsidiaries
at March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(3) on page 28 present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in fiscal 1999.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The Summary of Earnings of Independent
Trailer Fleets included on pages 72 through 73 of this Form 10-K is presented
for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic
financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

                      AMERCO AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION
     AMERCO, a Nevada corporation (AMERCO), is the holding company for U-Haul
International, Inc. (U-Haul), Amerco Real Estate Company (Real Estate),
Republic Western Insurance Company (RepWest) and Oxford Life Insurance Company
(Oxford).  All references to a fiscal year refer to AMERCO's fiscal year ended
March 31 of that year.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent
corporation, AMERCO, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All material
intercompany accounts and transactions of AMERCO and its subsidiaries have been
eliminated.

     RepWest and Oxford have been consolidated on the basis of calendar years
ended December 31.  Accordingly, all references to the years 2000, 1999, and
1998 and correspond to AMERCO's fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

     The operating results and financial position of AMERCO's consolidated
insurance operations are determined as of December 31 of each year.  There were
no effects related to intervening events between January 1 and March 31 of
2001, 2000, or 1999 that would materially affect the consolidated financial
position or results of operations for the financial statements presented
herein.  See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the insurance subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
     Moving and self-storage operations consist of the rental of trucks and
trailers, sale of moving supplies, trailer hitches and propane and the rental
of self-storage spaces to the do-it-yourself mover.  Operations are under the
registered tradename U-Haul REGISTERED TRADEMARK throughout the United States
and Canada.

     Real Estate owns approximately 90% of AMERCO's real estate assets,
including U-Haul's Center and Storage locations.  The remainder of the
properties are owned by various U-Haul entities.  Real Estate is responsible for
managing all of the properties including the environmental risks of the
properties.  Real Estate is responsible for the purchase of all properties used
by AMERCO or any of its subsidiaries.  Real Estate also handles all of the
dispositions (sale and lease) of unused real estate.

     RepWest originates and reinsures property and casualty type insurance
products for various market participants, including independent third parties,
U-Haul's customers, independent dealers and AMERCO.

     Oxford originates and reinsures annuities, credit life and disability,
life insurance, and supplemental health products.  Oxford also administers the
self-insured employee health and dental plans for AMERCO.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of U-Haul Co.
(Canada) Ltd., a subsidiary of U-Haul.  The assets and liabilities,
denominated in foreign currency, are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.  Revenue and expense amounts are
translated at average monthly exchange rates.  The related translation gains or
losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders'
Equity and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and
accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
     AMERCO considers liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents (zero as of March 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively).

RECEIVABLES
     Accounts receivable include trade accounts from customers and dealers.
RepWest and Oxford receivables include premiums and agents' balances due, net
of commissions payable and amounts due from ceding reinsurers.  Accounts
receivable are reduced by amounts considered by management to be uncollectible
based on historical collection loss experience and a review of the current
status of existing receivables.

     Notes and mortgage receivables include accrued interest and are reduced by
discounts and amounts considered by management to be uncollectible.

INVENTORIES
     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is primarily
determined using the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method.

INVESTMENTS
     Fixed maturities consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks.  Fair
values for investments are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or
discounted cash flows.  Fixed maturities are classified as follows:

     Held-to-maturity - recorded at cost adjusted for the amortization of
       premiums or accretion of discounts.
     Available-for-sale - recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or
       losses reported on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Changes
       in Stockholders' Equity unless such changes are deemed to be other than
       temporary.  Gains and losses on the sale of these securities are
       reported as a component of revenues using the specific identification
       method.
     Trading portfolio - AMERCO does not currently maintain a trading portfolio.
     Mortgage loans & notes on real estate held by AMERCO's subsidiaries - at
       unpaid balances, net of allowance for possible losses and any
       unamortized premium or discount.
     Real estate - at cost less accumulated depreciation.
     Policy loans - at their unpaid balance.

     Investment income is recognized as follows:
       Interest on bonds and mortgage loans & notes - recognized when earned.
       Dividends on common and redeemable preferred stocks - recognized on
         ex-dividend dates.
       Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments - recognized at the
         trade date and included in revenues using the specific identification
         method.

     Short-term investments consist of other securities scheduled to mature
within one year of their acquisition date.  See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS
     Commissions and other costs which vary with and are primarily related to
the production of new business, have been deferred.

     Oxford - costs are amortized in relation to revenue such that profits are
realized as a level percentage of revenue.

     RepWest - costs are amortized over the related contract period which
generally do not exceed one year.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
     Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on
the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.  Building and non-rental equipment have estimated lives ranging from
three to fifty-five years, while rental equipment have estimated lives ranging
from one to twenty years.  Maintenance is charged to operating expenses as
incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized.  Major overhaul costs
are amortized over the estimated period benefited.  Gains and losses on
dispositions are netted against depreciation expense when realized.  Interest
costs incurred as part of the initial construction of assets are capitalized.
Interest expense of $2,450,000, $1,359,000 and $909,000 was capitalized during
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  During fiscal year 2001,
based on an in-depth market analysis, U-Haul decreased the estimated salvage
value and increased the useful lives of certain service vehicles, rental trucks
and engines.  The effect of the change increased net earnings for fiscal year
2001 by $1,490,000 ($0.07 per share).  The adjustment reflects management's
best estimate, based on information available, of the estimated salvage value
and useful lives of these service vehicles, rental trucks and engines.

     AMERCO reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable through expected undiscounted future operating cash
flows.

     The carrying value of AMERCO's real estate that is no longer necessary
for use in its current operations, and available for sale/lease, at March 31,
2001 and 2000, was approximately $27,691,000 and $27,732,000, respectively.
Such properties available for sale are carried at cost, less accumulated
depreciation, which is less than fair market value.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
   Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental
assessments and remedial efforts, if applicable, are probable and the costs can
be reasonably estimated.  The liability is based on AMERCO's best estimate of
undiscounted future costs.  Certain recoverable environmental costs related to
the removal of underground storage tanks or related contamination are
capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the properties.
The capitalized costs improve the safety or efficiency of the property as
compared to when the property was originally acquired or are incurred in
preparing the property for sale.


FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     AMERCO enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its floating
interest rate exposure and does not use the agreements for trading purposes.
Although AMERCO is exposed to credit loss for the interest rate differential in
the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements, it does
not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

For the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, AMERCO recognized $16,000
and $27,000 as interest income and $89,000 as interest expense, respectively,
representing the ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedging activity.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

     AMERCO has mortgage receivables which potentially expose AMERCO to credit
risk.  The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by mini-warehouse
storage facilities and other residential and commercial properties.  AMERCO has
not experienced losses related to the notes from individual notes or groups of
notes in any particular industry or geographic area.  The estimated fair values
were determined using the discounted cash flow method, using interest rates
currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

Fair value summary of note and mortgage receivables:

                          March 31, 2001                March 31, 2000

                    =======================        ======================

     Other financial instruments that are subject to fair value disclosure
requirements are carried in the financial statements at amounts that
approximate fair value, unless elsewhere disclosed.  See below, as well as
Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     AMERCO's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables
and notes receivable.  AMERCO places its temporary cash investments with
financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their
dispersion across many different industries and geographic areas.  As discussed
in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, at March 31, 2001 and
2000, notes receivable are primarily due from one related party.

POLICY BENEFITS AND LOSSES, CLAIMS AND LOSS EXPENSES PAYABLE
     Liabilities for policy benefits payable on traditional life and certain
annuity policies are established in amounts adequate to meet estimated future
obligations on policies in force.  These liabilities are computed using
mortality and withdrawal assumptions which are based upon recognized actuarial
tables and contain margins for adverse deviation.  At December 31, 2000,
interest assumptions used to compute policy benefits payable range from 2.5% to
9.25%.

     The liability for annuity contracts, which are accounted for as investment
contract deposits, consists of contract account balances that accrue to the
benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges.  Carrying value of
investment contract deposits were $522,207,000 and $461,673,000 at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Liabilities for health and disability and other policy claims and benefits
payable represent estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for
reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but not yet reported.  These
estimates are based on past claims experience and consider current claim trends
as well as social and economic conditions.

     RepWest's liability for reported and unreported losses are based on
RepWest's historical and industry averages.  The liability for unpaid loss
adjustment expenses is based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses
paid to losses paid.  Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses are
estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the
reinsured policy.  Adjustments to the liability for unpaid losses and loss
expenses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses are
charged or credited to expense in periods in which they are made.

RENTAL REVENUE
     U-Haul recognizes its share of rental revenue less commission on the
accrual basis pursuant to contractual arrangements between AMERCO and its fleet
owners, rental dealers and customers.  See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

PREMIUM REVENUE
     Credit life and disability, Medicare supplement and property-casualty
gross premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related
contracts.  The portion of premiums not earned at the end of the period is
recorded as unearned premiums.  Traditional life and annuity premiums are
recognized as revenue when due from policyholders.  Revenue for annuity
contracts which are accounted for as investment contracts are included in net
investment income as investment margins until the contractholder annuitizes,
at which time the contractholder's fund balance is recognized as premium.

REINSURANCE
     Reinsurance premiums, commissions and expense reimbursements, related to
ceded business, are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in
accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance
contracts.  Premiums ceded to other companies have been reported as a reduction
of premium income.  Assets and liabilities relating to ceded contracts are
reported gross of the effects of reinsurance.  See also "Policy Benefits and
Losses, Claims and Loss Expenses Payable" above.

INCOME TAXES
     AMERCO files a consolidated federal income tax return with its
subsidiaries.  In addition to charging income for taxes paid or payable, the
provision for income taxes reflects deferred income taxes resulting from
changes in temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.  The effect
on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date.

ADVERTISING COSTS
     AMERCO expenses advertising costs as incurred.  Advertising expense of
$36,212,000, $34,772,000 and $33,567,000 was charged to operations for fiscal
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
     New pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
adopted during the year are not material to the consolidated financial
statements of AMERCO.  Further, pronouncements with future effective dates are
either not applicable or not material to the consolidated financial statements
of AMERCO.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
     Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding for the year and quarterly periods, excluding
shares of the employee stock ownership plan that have not been committed to be
released.  Preferred dividends include undeclared or unpaid dividends of
AMERCO.  Net income is reduced for preferred dividends for the purpose of the
calculation.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share in fiscal years
2000 and 1999 included assumed conversions of the Series B preferred stock into
common stock.  In fiscal year 2001, the assumed conversions are not applicable.
In fiscal year 2000, the assumed conversions had a dilutive effect; in fiscal
year 1999 the assumed conversions had no material effect on the calculated
earnings per share amount.  See Notes 6 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
     For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the Company recorded a net loss of
$46,650,000, compared to a net loss of $9,618,000 for the quarter ended
March 31, 2000.  The increased loss in 2001 was primarily due to a $19,300,000
decline in the insurance segment due to unprofitable lines of business, a
$6,500,000 write-down of investments and a $10,300,000 loss from the
supplement of litigation.  The remaining loss was due to weather problems and
other operating expenses impacting the moving and storage segment.  In
addition, third quarter 2001 financial information has been restated by the
Company to increase net loss $0.10 per share, respectively, due to necessary
revisions related to certain fixed asset transactions.  The restated loss
per share was $1.05 for the third quarter fiscal year 2001 as compared to
$0.95 as reported.

     During fiscal year 2001, subsidiaries of AMERCO held various senior and
junior notes with SAC Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries (SAC Holdings).
The voting common stock of SAC Holdings is held by Mark V. Shoen, a major
stockholder of AMERCO.  AMERCO's subsidiaries received interest payments of
$27,592,000, $20,111,000, and $8,022,000 from SAC Holdings during fiscal years
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  Principal payments of $97,953,000,
$105,689,000, and zero were received during fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.  The note receivable balance outstanding was, in the aggregate,
$251,021,000 and $154,528,000 at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, bearing
interest rates ranging from 8.37% to 13.0%.  The principal balance is due in
full at maturity and interest is payable quarterly.  The terms of the notes
receivable are consistent with the terms of notes receivable held by U-Haul
for other properties owned by unrelated parties and managed by U-Haul.

     During fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, a subsidiary of AMERCO funded
through notes receivable the purchase of properties and construction costs for
SAC Holdings of $187,595,000, $44,934,000 and $26,116,000, respectively.

     In June 2000, Real Estate completed the sale of twenty-four storage
properties to Twelve SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Thirteen SAC Self-Storage
Corporation and Fourteen SAC Self-Storage Corporation, subsidiaries of SAC
Holding Corporation, for $98,351,000.  Real Estate received cash and notes from
the sale.  The gain is reflected of consolidated statements of changes in
stockholders equity.

     In December 1998, U-Haul and Real Estate completed the sale of twenty-six
storage properties to Six SAC Self-Storage Corporation, a subsidiary of SAC
Holdings, for $99,685,000.  Real Estate received cash and notes from the sale.
The gain is reflected of consolidated statements of changes in stockholders'
equity.

     U-Haul currently manages the properties owned by SAC Holdings under a
management agreement, whereby U-Haul receives a management fee equal to 6% of
the gross receipts from the properties.  Management fees of $6,243,000,
$4,482,000 and $2,483,000 were received during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The 6% fee is consistent with the fees received by U-Haul for
other properties owned by unrelated parties and managed by U-Haul.

     Management believes that the foregoing transactions were consummated on
terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions.

     Inventories are stated net of reserve for obsolescence of $3,321,000 at
March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Certain general and administrative
expenses are allocated to ending inventories.  Such costs remaining in
inventory are estimated at $12,077,000 and $12,084,000  at March 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.  For fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, aggregate general
and administrative costs were $498,661,000, $461,722,000 and $562,745,000,
respectively.

     LIFO inventories, which represent approximately 96% of total inventories
at March 31, 2001 and 2000, would have been $4,957,000 greater at
March 31, 2001 and 2000, if the consolidated group had used the FIFO (first-in,
first-out) method.

     Short-term investments consist primarily of fixed maturities of three
months to one year from acquisition date.  Mortgage loans, representing first
lien mortgages held by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at unpaid
balances, less allowance for possible losses and any unamortized premium or
discount.  Equity investments and real estate obtained through foreclosures and
held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  U.S. government
securities mutual fund is carried at cost which approximates market value.
Policy loans are carried at their unpaid balance.

     At December 31, 2000 and 1999, mortgage loans held as investments with a
carrying value of $102,571,000 and $73,716,000, respectively, were outstanding.
The estimated fair value of the mortgage loans at December 31, 2000 and 1999
aggregated $94,669,000 and $74,559,000, respectively.  The estimated fair values
were determined using the discounted cash flow method, using interest rates
currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.
Investments in mortgage loans, included as a component of investments, are
reported net of allowance for possible losses of $402,000 and $225,000 in 2000
and 1999, respectively.

     In February 1997, AMERCO, through its insurance subsidiaries, invested in
the equity of a limited partnership in a Texas-based self-storage corporation.
RepWest invested $13,500,000 and has a 38% limited partnership interest and
Oxford invested $11,000,000 and has a 27% limited partnership interest.  U-Haul
is a 50% owner of a corporation which is a general partner in the Texas-based
self-storage corporation.  AMERCO has a $10,000,000 note receivable from PMSI
Investors L.L.C., a 30% limited partner in the corporation.  During 1997, the
corporation secured a line of credit in the amount of $225,000,000 with a
financing institution.  Under the terms of this credit facility, AMERCO entered
into a support party agreement with the corporation whereby upon default or
noncompliance with debt covenants by the corporation, AMERCO assumes
responsibility in fulfilling all obligations related to this credit facility.

     AMERCO has a revolving credit loan (long-term) available from
participating banks under an agreement which provides for a credit line of
$400,000,000 through June 30, 2002.  Depending on the form of borrowing
elected, interest will be based on the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR),
prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, or rates determined by a
competitive bid.  LIBOR loans include a spread based upon the senior debt
rates of AMERCO.  Facility fees paid are based upon the amount of credit line.

     At March 31, 2001, AMERCO had borrowed $305,100,000, representing
short-term borrowings, from its total committed lines of credit of
$94,900,000.

     As of March 31, 2001, loans outstanding under the revolving credit line
totaled $185,000,000.  Management intends to refinance the borrowings on a long-
term basis by either replacing them with long-term obligations, renewing or
extending them.

5.  NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE, continued

     AMERCO has entered into interest rate swap agreements (SWAPS) to
potentially mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating
rate debt.  These agreements effectively change AMERCO's interest rate exposure
on $45,000,000 of floating rate notes to a weighted average fixed rate of
8.45%.  The SWAPS mature at the time the related notes mature.  Incremental
interest expense associated with SWAP activity was $1,027,000, $1,935,000 and
$2,593,000 during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     At March 31, 2001, interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional
amount of $45,000,000 were outstanding.  Management estimates that at March 31,
2001 and 2000, AMERCO would be required to pay $3,696,000 and $1,888,000,
respectively, to terminate the agreements.  Such amounts were determined from
current treasury rates combined with SWAP spreads on agreements outstanding.

     During April 1999, AMERCO issued $150,000,000 of 7.20% Senior Notes due
2002.  During February 2000, AMERCO issued $200,000,000 of 8.80% Senior Notes
due 2005.

     During fiscal year 2001, AMERCO extinguished $100,000,000 of BATs with
interest of 6.89% originally due in fiscal year 2011, and $25,000,000 of 6.71%
Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year 2009.  This resulted in an
extraordinary loss of $2,121,000, net of tax of $1,160,000 ($0.10 per share).

     During fiscal year 2000, AMERCO extinguished $100,000,000 of BATs with
interest of 6.65% originally due in fiscal year 2030, and $50,000,000 of 7.05%
to 7.10% Medium-Term notes originally due in fiscal year 2007.  This resulted in
an extraordinary loss of $334,000, net of tax of $213,000 ($0.02 per share).

     Certain of AMERCO's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and
other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring
additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing
certain additional liens on its properties and assets.  At March 31, 2001,
AMERCO was in compliance with these covenants.

     The annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years adjusted

maturity), are presented in the table below:

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued


6.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     AMERCO has authorized capital stock consisting of 150,000,000 shares of
common stock, 150,000,000 shares of Serial common stock and 50,000,000 shares
of Serial preferred stock.  The Board of Directors (the Board) may authorize
the Serial common stock to be issued in such series and on such terms as the
Board shall determine.  Serial preferred stock issuance may be with or without
par value.

     AMERCO has issued 6,100,000 shares of 8.5% cumulative, no par, non-voting
Series A preferred stock (Series A).  The Series A is not convertible into, or
exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of AMERCO.
Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears and have priority as to dividends
over AMERCO's common stock.  On or after December 1, 2000, AMERCO, at its
option, may redeem all or part of the Series A, for cash at $25.00 per share
plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

     AMERCO placed funds of $48,234,000 into an escrow account pending the
outcome of a dispute involving the entitlement of the plaintiffs to post-
petition interest.  The escrow account was transferred to the plaintiffs on
February 2, 2000, after it was determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to
such interest.  The transfer was recorded net of tax of $18,570,000, and
reflected as a component of stockholders' equity.

     The plaintiffs included the father, brothers and sisters of Mark V. and
Paul F. Shoen who are major stockholders of AMERCO, and Edward J. and
James P. Shoen who are major stockholders and directors of AMERCO.

     The deferred tax asset was reduced by use of a portion of the net
operating loss carryforward to offset a related party gain that increased
additional paid in capital.

     In light of AMERCO's history of profitable operations, management has
concluded that it is more likely than not that AMERCO will ultimately realize
the full benefit of its deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, AMERCO believes that
a valuation allowance is not required at March 31, 2001 and 2000.  See also Note

will be payable thereon at applicable current rates if amounts in this account
are distributed to the stockholder or to the extent the account exceeds a
prescribed maximum.  Oxford did not incur a Phase III liability for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

     The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting audits on fiscal
years 1996 and 1997.  To date, the audits have not been completed.

     At March 31, 2001, AMERCO and RepWest have non-life net operating loss
carryforwards available to offset federal taxable income in future years of
$119,495,000 for tax purposes.  These carryforwards expire in 2011 through
2012.  AMERCO has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $15,489,000
which do not have an expiration date, but may only be utilized in years in
which regular tax exceeds alternative minimum tax.  The use of certain
carryforwards may be limited or prohibited if a reorganization or other change
in corporate ownership were to occur.

     During 1994, Oxford distributed its investment in RepWest common stock
as a dividend to its parent at its book value.  As a result of such dividend,
a deferred intercompany gain arose due to the difference between the book value
and fair value of such common stock.  However, such gain can only be triggered
if certain events occur.  To date, no events have occurred which would trigger
such gain recognition.  No deferred taxes have been provided in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as management believes that no
events have occurred to trigger such gain.

10.  TRANSACTIONS WITH FLEET OWNERS AND OTHER RENTAL EQUIPMENT OWNERS

     Independent rental equipment owners (fleet owners) own approximately 5% of
all U-Haul rental trailers and 0.01% of certain other rental equipment.  There
are approximately 1,919 fleet owners, including certain officers, directors,
employees and stockholders of AMERCO.  All rental equipment is operated under
contract with U-Haul whereby U-Haul administers the operations and marketing of
such equipment and in return receives a percentage of rental fees paid by
customers.  Based on the terms of various contracts, rental fees are
distributed to U-Haul (for services as operators), to the fleet owners
(including certain subsidiaries and related parties of U-Haul) and to Rental
Dealers (including Company-operated U-Haul Centers).

     RepWest insures and reinsures certain risks of U-Haul customers and
independent fleet owners.  Premiums earned on these policies were $17,300,000,
$22,700,000 and $41,000,000 during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.


11.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     AMERCO participates in the AMERCO Employee Savings, Profit Sharing and
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan) which is designed to provide all
eligible employees with savings for their retirement and to acquire a
proprietary interest in AMERCO.

     The Plan has three separate features: a profit sharing feature (the Profit
Sharing Plan) under which the Employer may make contributions on behalf of
participants; a savings feature (the Savings Plan) which allows participants to
defer income under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and an
employee stock ownership feature (the ESOP) under which AMERCO may make
contributions of AMERCO common stock or cash to acquire such stock on behalf of
participants.  Generally, employees of AMERCO are eligible to participate in
the Plan upon completion of a one year service requirement.

     No contributions were made to the profit sharing plan in fiscal year 2001,
2000, or 1999.

     AMERCO has arranged financing to fund the ESOP trust (ESOT) and to enable
the ESOT to purchase shares.  Below is a summary of the financing arrangements:

     For purposes of the schedule, fair value of unreleased shares issued prior
to December 31, 1992 is defined as the historical cost of such shares.  Fair
value of unreleased shares issued subsequent to December 31, 1992 is defined as
the March 31 trading value of such shares for 2001 and 2000.

     Oxford insures various group life and group disability insurance plans
covering employees of the consolidated group.  Premiums earned were $1,424,000,
$1,276,000 and $1,208,000 during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively, and were eliminated in consolidation.


12.  POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

     AMERCO provides medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees
and eligible dependents over age 65 if the employee meets specified age and
service requirements.

     AMERCO uses the accrual method of accounting for postretirement benefits.
AMERCO continues to fund medical and life insurance benefit costs as claims are
incurred.

     The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2001, 2000
and 1999 are as follows:

                                                   2001        2000        1999

     The 2001 and 2000 postretirement benefit liability included the following
components:

                                                              2001        2000

     The discount rate assumptions in computing the information above were as
follows:

                                                  2001       2000       1999

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation     7.50%      7.75%      7.00%

     The year-to-year fluctuations in the discount rate assumptions primarily
reflect changes in U.S. interest rates.  The discount rate represents the
expected yield on a portfolio of high-grade (AA-AAA rated or equivalent) fixed-
income investments with cash flow streams sufficient to satisfy benefit
obligations under the plans when due.

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 6.00% in 2001, declining annually to an
ultimate rate of 4.20% in 2015.

12.  POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, continued

     If the health care cost trend rate assumptions were increased by 1.00%,
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of March 31, 2001 would be
increased by approximately $180,000 and a decrease of 1.00% would reduce the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $198,000.

     Postemployment benefits provided by AMERCO are not material.


13.  REINSURANCE

     In the normal course of business, RepWest and Oxford assume and cede
reinsurance on both a coinsurance and risk premium basis.  RepWest and Oxford
obtain reinsurance for that portion of risks exceeding retention limits.  The
maximum amount of life insurance retained on any one life is $150,000.

     A summary of reinsurance transactions by business segment follows:

                                                                    Percentage

     RepWest is a reinsurer of municipal bond insurance through an agreement
with MBIA, Inc.  Premiums generated through this agreement are recognized on a
pro rata basis over the contract coverage period.  Unearned premiums on this
coverage were $4,300,000 and $5,000,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  RepWest's share of case loss reserves related to this coverage
was insignificant at December 31, 2000.  RepWest's aggregate exposure for Class
1 municipal bond insurance was $883,000,000 as of December 31, 2000.

     To the extent that a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation under the
related reinsurance agreements, RepWest would remain liable for the unpaid
losses and loss expenses.  Pursuant to certain of these agreements, RepWest
holds letters of credit of $13,000,000 from reinsurers.  RepWest has issued
letters of credit of approximately $2,700,000 in favor of certain ceding
companies.

     RepWest insures and reinsures general liability, auto liability and
workers' compensation coverage for member companies of the consolidated group.
Premiums earned by RepWest on these policies were $6,091,000, $6,878,000 and
$11,734,000 during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, and were eliminated in consolidation.


14.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

     AMERCO uses certain equipment and occupies certain facilities under
operating lease commitments with terms expiring through 2079.  Lease expense
was $178,458,000, $136,044,000 and $118,742,000 for the years ended
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  During the year ended March 31, 2001, a
subsidiary of U-Haul entered into thirty five transactions and has
subsequently entered into one additional transaction, whereby AMERCO sold
rental trucks, which were subsequently leased back.  AMERCO has guaranteed
$195,052,000 of residual values at March 31, 2001 and an additional
$1,350,000 subsequent to March 31, 2001 for these assets at the end
of the respective lease terms.  Certain leases contain renewal and fair market
value purchase options as well as mileage and other restrictions similar to
covenants disclosed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
notes payable and loan agreements.

     The Company, at the expiration of the lease, has the option to renew the
lease, purchase the units for fair market value, or sell the units to a third
party on behalf of the lessor.  On or before a specific date prior to the
expiration date of the lease, the Company has the ability to exercise a TRAC
option.  Under this provision the Company has the right to purchase the units
at a specified price.  At March 31, 2001, U-Haul had not exercised any options
to purchase units.  Subsequent to March 31, 2001, the Company exercised one
purchase option totaling $972,000.

     In December 1996, AMERCO executed a $100,000,000 Operating Lease Facility
with a number of financial institutions which was amended and restated in July
1999 to $170,000,000.  In September 1999, AMERCO entered into an additional
$125,000,000 Operating Lease Facility.  Under these facilities, the lessor
acquires land to be developed for storage locations by AMERCO, as Construction
Agent, or acquires existing storage locations with advances of funds (the
Advances) made by certain parties to the facilities.  AMERCO will separately
lease land and improvements, including completed locations capitalized by the
lessor, under the facilities and the respective lease supplements.  Funding
under the facilities totaled $231,664,000 and $174,900,000 at March 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

     The facilities contain certain restrictions similar to those contained in
Note 5.  Upon occurrence of any event of default, the lessor may rescind or
terminate any or all leases and, among other things, require AMERCO to
repurchase any or all of the properties.  The facilities have a three year
term, subject to AMERCO's option, with the consent of other parties, to renew
for successive one year terms.

     Upon the expiration of the facilities, AMERCO may either purchase all of
the properties based on a purchase price equal to all amounts outstanding under
the Advances, including the interest and yield thereon, or remarket all of the
properties to a third party purchaser who may become a subsequent lessor to
AMERCO.

     In the normal course of business, AMERCO is a defendant in a number of
suits and claims.  AMERCO is also a party to several administrative proceedings
arising from state and local provisions that regulate the removal and/or cleanup
of underground fuel storage tanks.  It is the opinion of management that none of
such suits, claims or proceedings involving AMERCO, individually or in the
aggregate, are expected to result in a material loss.  Also see Notes 13 and 15
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

15.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On October 1, 1996, AMERCO made the final payment of approximately
$448,100,000 to the plaintiffs (non-management shareholders and their
affiliates) in the full settlement of a legal dispute related to control of
AMERCO.  As a result, the plaintiffs that owned AMERCO stock were required to
transfer all of their shares of common stock to AMERCO.  The total number of
shares transferred was 18,254,976.

     On January 10, 2000 it was determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to
post-petition interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year from February
21, 1995 until October 1, 1996.  In 1996, AMERCO deposited approximately
$48,200,000 into an escrow account to secure payment of the disputed interest,
pending final resolution of this issue.  The escrow account was reflected as a
component of "Other assets" in AMERCO's consolidated financial statements.  The
amount deposited into the escrow account was transferred to the plaintiffs on
February 2, 2000.  The release of the escrow did not have the effect of
increasing or decreasing AMERCO's net earnings, but reduced stockholders'
equity.

     AMERCO has deducted for income tax purposes approximately $372,000,000 of
payments previously made to the former shareholders.  While AMERCO believes that
such income tax deductions are appropriate, there can be no assurance that such
deductions ultimately will be allowed in full.

     On June 24, 1997, five (5) current and/or former Moving Center General
Managers (GMs) and one (1) Area Field Manager (AFM) filed suit in Marin County
Superior Court, Case No. BC 203532, entitled Sarah Saunders, et al. vs. U-Haul
                                             ----------------------     ------
Company of California, Inc., claiming that they were entitled to be compensated
- ---------------------------
for all overtime hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week.  In
addition, these Plaintiffs sought class action status purporting to represent
all persons employed in California as either a salaried GM or AFM since
September 1993.  On September 30, 1997, a virtually identical lawsuit was filed
in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. BC 178775, entitled Wyatt
                                                                   -----
Crandall vs. U-Haul International, Inc. and U-Haul Co. of California.  This
- --------     -------------------------------------------------------
action did not include AFMs, but did purport to be brought on behalf of GMs and
GM trainees.  These cases were consolidated by the Court in Los Angeles on
October 15, 1998.  On June 10, 1999, Plaintiff's motion to certify the AFMs as a
class was denied and the motion to certify the GMs as a class was granted.
Notice of certification was mailed on or about August 24, 1999.  The class opt-
out period ended on October 11, 1999.  The case was bifurcated and the liability
portion of the case was tried to the Court. The Court found for the Plaintiff's
on January 8, 2001.  The damage portion of the case was to begin on April 9,
2001.  The Company settled the case for $7.5 million on April 5, 2001, and the
Court approved the settlement on May 22, 2001.  The class approval process will
take between 60 and 120 days from the time of the Court approval.

16.  PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

     AMERCO's Board of Directors adopted a stockholder-rights plan in July
1998.  The rights were declared as a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each outstanding share of AMERCO's common stock.  The dividend
distribution was payable on August 17, 1998 to the stockholders of record on
that date.  When exercisable, each right will entitle its holder to purchase
from AMERCO one one-hundredth of a share of Series C Junior Participating
Preferred Stock (Series C), no par value per share of AMERCO, at a price of
$132.00 per one one-hundredth of a share of Series C, subject to adjustment.
AMERCO has created a series of 3,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued
preferred stock for the Series C stock authorized in this stockholder-rights
plan.

      The rights will become exercisable if a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons acquire or obtain the right to acquire beneficial ownership
of 10% or more of the common stock without approval of a majority of the Board
of Directors of AMERCO.  The rights will expire on August 7, 2008 unless
earlier redeemed or exchanged by AMERCO.

     In the event AMERCO is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction after the rights become exercisable, each holder of a right would
be entitled to receive that number of shares of the acquiring company's common
stock equal to the result obtained by multiplying the then current Purchase
Price by the number one one-hundredths of a share of Series C for which a right
is then exercisable and dividing that product by 50% of the then current market
price per share of the acquiring company.

17.  STOCK OPTION PLAN

     AMERCO's stockholders approved a ten year incentive plan entitled the
AMERCO Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the Plan) for officers and key
employees in October 1992.  No stock options or awards have been granted under
this plan to date.

     The aggregate numbers of shares of stock subject to award under the Plan
may not exceed 3,000,000.  The stock subject to the Plan is AMERCO common stock
unless prior to the date the first award is made under the Plan, a Committee of
at least two Board members determines, in its discretion, to utilize another
class of AMERCO stock.  The features of the Plan are:

     Incentive Stock Options (ISO's) - as defined under the Internal Revenue
     Code and Non-qualified Stock Options under such terms and conditions as
     the Committee determines in its discretion.  The ISO's may be granted at
     prices not less than one-hundred percent of the fair market value at the
     date of grant with a term not exceeding ten years.

     Stock Appreciation Right (SAR's) - subject to certain conditions and
     limitations to holders of options under the Plan.  SAR's permit the
     optionee to surrender an exercisable option for an amount equal to the
     excess of the market price of the common stock over the option price when
     the right is exercised.

     Restricted Stock Award - a specified number of common shares may be
     granted subject to certain restrictions.  Restriction violations during a
     specified period result in forfeiture of the stock.  The Committee may, at
     its discretion, impose any restrictions on a Restricted Stock award.

     Dividend Equivalents - in connection with options.  Dividend Equivalents
     are rights to receive additional shares of stock at the time of exercise
     of the option to which such Dividend Equivalents apply.

     Performance Share - deemed to be the equivalent of one share of stock and
     credited to a Performance Share account to be maintained for each Holder.
     The value of the shares at time of award or payment is the fair market
     value of an equivalent number of shares of stock.  At the end of the award
     period, payment may be made subject to certain predetermined criteria and
     restrictions.


18.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     AMERCO has related party transactions with certain major stockholders,
directors and officers of the consolidated group as disclosed in Notes 2, 6, 10
and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     During the years ended 2001 and 2000, AMERCO sold $10,510,000
and $3,910,000, respectively, of remanufactured engines and small automotive
parts and purchased $53,671,000 and $38,373,000, respectively, of automotive
parts and tools from a company wherein a major stockholder, director and
officer of AMERCO has a beneficial minority ownership interest.

     During the years ended 2001 and 2000, AMERCO purchased $1,090,000 and
$2,508,000, respectively, of rebuilt torque converters and other related
transmission parts from a company wherein an owner is a family member of a
major stockholder, director and officer of AMERCO.

     During the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, AMERCO purchased $3,460,000,
$3,371,000 and $3,070,000, respectively, of printing from a company wherein an
officer is a major stockholder, director and officer of AMERCO.

     Management believes that these transactions were consummated on terms
equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions.

                                                    Additional Information

(A) The accompanying Summary of Earnings of Independent Trailer Fleets includes the operations of trailers under
     the brand name of "U-Haul" owned by Independent Fleet Owners.  Earnings data represent the aggregate results
     of operations before depreciation and taxes.  Investment data represent the cost of trailers and investments
     before accumulated depreciation.

     Fleet Owner income is based on Independent Rental Dealer reports of rentals transacted through the day
     preceding the last Monday of each month and received by U-Haul International, Inc. by the end of the month
     and Company-Operated U-Haul Center reports of rentals transacted through the last day of each month.
     Payments to Fleet Owners for trailers lost or retired from rental service as a result of damage by accident
     have not been reflected in this summary because such payments do not relate to earnings before depreciation
     and income taxes but, rather, investment (depreciation).

     The investment data is based upon the cost of trailers to the Fleet Owners as reflected by sales records of
     the U-Haul manufacturing facilities.

(B) The summary of earnings data stated in terms of amount per $100 of average investment represents
     the aggregate results of operations (earnings data) divided by the average amount of investment during the
     periods.  The average amount of investment is based upon a simple average of the month-end investment during
     each period.  Average earnings data is not necessarily representative of an individual Fleet Owner's
     earnings.

(C) A summary of operations expenses charged directly to Independent Fleet Owners follows:

(D) The Fleet Owners and Subsidiary U-Haul Rental Companies forego normal commissions on a portion of gross
     rental fees designated for transfer to the Trailer Accident Fund.  Trailer accident repair expenses,
     otherwise chargeable to Fleet Owners, are paid from these Funds to the extent of the financial resources of
     the Funds.  The amounts designated "Trailer Accident Fund credit" in the accompanying summary of earnings
     represent Independent Fleetowner commissions foregone, which exceed expenses borne by the Funds.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     AMERCO, a Nevada corporation, was incorporated in April, 1969, and is the
holding company for U-Haul International, Inc., Republic Western Insurance
Company, Oxford Life Insurance Company and Amerco Real Estate Company.  The
financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K.

     AMERCO is included in a consolidated Federal income tax return with all of
its U.S. subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the provision for income taxes has been
calculated for Federal income taxes of the Registrant and subsidiaries included
in the consolidated return of the Registrant.  State taxes for all subsidiaries
are allocated to the respective subsidiaries.

     The financial statements include only the accounts of the Registrant (a
Nevada corporation), which include certain of the corporate operations of
AMERCO.  The debt and related interest expense of the Registrant have been
allocated to the consolidated subsidiaries.  The intercompany interest income
and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

2.  GUARANTEES

     AMERCO has guaranteed performance of certain long-term leases.  See Note
14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                         PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
                         -----------------------------

          THIS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered
     into as of June 8, 2001 among Seventeen SAC Self-Storage
     Corporation, a Nevada corporation, with its principal place of
     business at 715 South Country Club Drive, Mesa, AZ 85210 ("Owner"),
     and the property managers identified on Exhibit A attached hereto and
                                             ---------
     incorporated herein by reference (each such property manager is
     respectively referred to herein as "U-Haul").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

          A.  Owner owns the real property and self-storage related
     improvements thereon located at the street addresses identified on
     Exhibit A hereto (hereinafter, collectively the "Property").

          B.  Owner intends that the Property be rented on a space-by-
     space retail basis to corporations, partnerships, individuals and/or
     other entities for use as self-storage facilities.

          C.  Owner desires that U-Haul manage the Property and U-Haul
     desires to act as the property manager for the Property, all in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and as
     more specifically designated on Exhibit A hereto.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
     contained, Owner and U-Haul hereby agree as follows.

     1.  Employment.
         ----------

          (a) Owner hereby retains U-Haul, and U-Haul agrees to act as
     manager of the Property upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set
     forth.

          (b) Owner acknowledges that U-Haul, and/or U-Haul affiliates, is
     in the business of managing self-storage facilities, both for its own
     account and for the account of others.  It is hereby expressly agreed
     that notwithstanding this Agreement, U-Haul and such affiliates may
     continue to engage in such activities, may manage facilities other
     than those presently managed by U-Haul and its affiliates (whether or
     not such other facilities may be in direct or indirect competition
     with Owner) and may in the future engage in other business which may
     compete directly or indirectly with activities of Owner.

          (c) In the performance of their respective duties under this
     Agreement, each U-Haul property manager shall occupy the position of
     an independent contractor with respect to Owner.  Nothing contained
<PAGE>
     herein shall be construed as making the parties
     hereto (or any of them) partners or joint venturors, nor (except as
     expressly otherwise provided for herein) construed as making U-Haul
     an agent or employee of Owner or of any other U-Haul property manager
     hereunder.

     2.  Duties and Authority of U-Haul.
         ------------------------------

          (a) GENERAL DUTIES AND AUTHORITY.  Subject only to the
     restrictions and limitations provided in paragraphs (o) and (p) of
     this Section 2 and the right of Owner to terminate this Agreement as
     provided in Section 6 hereof, U-Haul shall have the sole and
     exclusive authority to fully manage the Property and supervise and
     direct the business and affairs associated or related to the daily
     operation thereof, and, to that end on behalf of Owner, to execute
     such documents and instruments as, in the sole judgment of U-Haul,
     are reasonably necessary or advisable under the circumstances in
     order to fulfill U-Haul's duties hereunder.  Such duties and
     authority shall include, without limitation, those set forth below.

          (b) RENTING OF THE PROPERTY.  U-Haul shall establish policies
     and procedures for the marketing activities for the Property, and may
     advertise the Property through such media as U-Haul deems advisable,
     including, without limitation, advertising with the Yellow Pages.
     U-Haul shall have the sole discretion, which discretion shall be
     exercised in good faith, to establish the terms and conditions of
     occupancy by the tenants of the Property, and U-Haul is hereby
     authorized to enter into rental agreements on behalf and for the
     account of Owner with such tenants and to collect rent from such
     tenants. U-Haul may jointly advertise the Property with other
     properties owned or managed by U-Haul, and in that event, U-Haul
     shall reasonably allocate the cost of such advertising among such
     properties.

          (c) REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS.  U-Haul shall make,
     execute, supervise and have control over the making and executing of
     all decisions concerning the acquisition of furniture, fixtures and
     supplies for the Property, and may purchase, lease or otherwise
     acquire the same on behalf of Owner.  U-Haul shall make and execute,
     or supervise and have control over the making and executing of all
     decisions concerning the maintenance, repair, and landscaping of the
     Property. U-Haul shall, on behalf of Owner, negotiate and contract
     for and supervise the installation of all capital improvements
     related to the Property; provided, however, that U-Haul agrees to
     secure the prior written approval of Owner on all such expenditures
     in excess of $5,000.00 for any one item, except monthly or recurring
     operating charges and/or emergency repairs if in the opinion of U-Haul
     such emergency-related expenditures are necessary to protect the
     Property from damage or to maintain services to the tenants as called
     for in their respective leases.

          (d) PERSONNEL.  U-Haul shall select all vendors, suppliers,
     contractors, subcontractors and employees with respect to the
     Property and shall hire, discharge and supervise all labor and
     employees required for the operation and maintenance of the Property.
<PAGE>
     Any employees so hired shall be employees of U-Haul, and shall be
     carried on the payroll of U-Haul.  Employees may include, but will
     not be limited to, on-site resident managers, on-site assistant
     managers, and relief managers located, rendering services, or
     performing activities on the Property in connection with its
     operation and management.  The cost of employing such persons shall
     not exceed prevailing rates for comparable persons performing the
     same or similar services with respect to real estate similar to the
     Property.

          (e) AGREEMENTS.  U-Haul shall negotiate and execute on behalf of
     Owner such agreements which U-Haul deems necessary or advisable for
     the furnishing of utilities, services, concessions and supplies, for
     the maintenance, repair and operation of the Property and such other
     agreements which may benefit the Property or be incidental to the
     matters for which U-Haul is responsible hereunder.

          (f) OTHER DECISIONS.  U-Haul shall make all decisions in
     connection with the daily operation of the Property.

          (g) REGULATIONS AND PERMITS.  U-Haul shall comply in all
     material respects with any statute, ordinance, law, rule, regulation
     or order of any governmental or regulatory body, having jurisdiction
     over the Property, respecting the use of the Property or the
     maintenance or operation thereof.  U-Haul shall apply for and attempt
     to obtain and maintain, on behalf of Owner, all licenses and permits
     required or advisable (in the sole judgment of U-Haul) in connection
     with the management and operation of the Property.

          (h) RECORDS AND REPORTS OF DISBURSEMENTS AND COLLECTIONS.
     U-Haul shall establish, supervise, direct and maintain the operation
     of a system of record keeping and bookkeeping with respect to all
     receipts and disbursements in connection with the management and
     operation of the Property.  The books, records and accounts shall be
     maintained at the U-Haul office or at such other location as U-Haul
     shall determine, and shall be available and open to examination and
     audit quarterly by Owner, its representatives, any mortgagee of the
     Property, and such mortgagee's representative.  On or before thirty
     (30) days after the close of each quarter, U-Haul shall cause to be
     prepared and delivered to Owner, a monthly statement of receipts,
     expenses and charges, together with a statement of the disbursements
     made by U-Haul during such period on Owner's behalf.

          (i) [Reserved].

          (j) COLLECTION.  U-Haul shall be responsible for the billing and
     collection of all accounts receivable and for payment of all accounts
     payable with respect to the Property and shall be responsible for
     establishing policies and procedures to minimize the amount of bad
     debts.
<PAGE>

          (k) LEGAL ACTIONS.  U-Haul shall cause to be instituted, on
     behalf and in the name of Owner, any and all legal actions or
     proceedings U-Haul deems necessary or advisable to collect charges,
     rent or other income due to Owner with respect to the Property and to
     oust or dispossess tenants or other persons unlawfully in possession
     under any lease, license concession agreement or otherwise, and to
     collect damages for breach thereof or default thereunder by such
     tenant, licensee, concessionaire or occupant.

          (l) INSURANCE.  U-Haul shall use its best efforts to assure that
     there is obtained and maintained in force, fire, comprehensive
     liability and other insurance policies in amounts generally carried
     with respect to similar facilities. U-Haul may in its discretion
     obtain employee theft or similar insurance in amounts and with such
     deductibles as U-Haul deems appropriate.  U-Haul shall promptly
     provide Owner with such certificates of insurance as Owner may
     reasonably request in writing, evidencing such insurance coverage.

          (m) TAXES.  During the term of this Agreement, U-Haul shall pay
     from Owner's funds, prior to delinquency, all real estate taxes,
     personal property taxes, and all other taxes assessed to, or levied
     upon, the Property.  If required by the holder of any note secured by
     the Property, U-Haul will set aside, from Owner's funds, a reserve
     from each month's rent and other income collected, in an amount
     required by said holder for purposes of payment of real property
     taxes.

          (n) [RESERVED].

          (o) LIMITATIONS ON U-HAUL AUTHORITY.  Notwithstanding anything
     to the contrary set forth in this Section 2, U-Haul shall not,
     without obtaining the prior written consent of Owner, (i) rent
     storage space in the Property by written lease or agreement for a
     stated term in excess of one year, (ii) alter the building or other
     structures of the Property in any material manner; (iii) make any
     other agreements which exceed a term of one year and are not
     terminable on thirty day's notice at the will of Owner, without
     penalty, payment or surcharge; (iv) act in violation of any law; or
     (v) act in violation of any duty or responsibility of Owner under any
     mortgage loan secured by the Property.

          (p) SHARED EXPENSES.  Owner acknowledges that certain economies
     may be achieved with respect to certain expenses to be incurred by
     U-Haul on behalf of Owner hereunder if materials, supplies, insurance
     or services are purchased by U-Haul in quantity for use not only in
     connection with the Property but in connection with other properties
     owned or managed by U-Haul or its affiliates.  U-Haul shall have the
     right to purchase such materials, supplies, insurance and/or services
     in its own name and charge Owner a pro rata allocable share of the
     cost of the foregoing; provided, however, that the pro rata cost of
     such purchase to Owner shall not result in expenses greater than
     would otherwise be incurred at competitive prices and terms available
<PAGE>
     in the area where the Property is located; and provided further,
     U-Haul shall give Owner access to records so Owner may review any such
     expenses incurred.

          (q)  DEPOSIT OF GROSS REVENUES.  All Gross Revenues (as
     hereinafter defined) shall be remitted by U-Haul (or its parent
     company) on a daily basis to a bank account maintained by UBS Warburg
     Real Estate Investments Inc. ("Lender") (or an affiliate thereof)
     and the funds therein shall be applied in the manner specified in
     that Cash Management Agreement dated the date hereof among Owner,
     U-Haul and Lender.  U-Haul shall maintain such records and systems as
     are necessary or appropriate to enable U-Haul to clearly identify the
     amount of Gross Revenue generated by each Property on a daily basis.

     3.  Duties of Owner.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to cooperate with U-Haul in the performance
     of U-Haul's duties under this Agreement and to that end, upon the
     request of U-Haul, to provide, at such rental charges, if any, as are
     deemed appropriate, reasonable office space for U-Haul employees on
     the premises of the Property and to give U-Haul access to all files,
     books and records of Owner relevant to the Property.  Owner shall not
     unreasonably withhold or delay any consent or authorization to U-Haul
     required or appropriate under this Agreement.

     4.  Compensation of U-Haul.
         ----------------------

          (a)  MANAGEMENT FEE. Owner shall pay to U-Haul as the full
     amount due for the services herein provided a fee (the "Management
     Fee") equal to six percent (6%) of the "Gross Revenue" derived from
     or connected with the Property so managed by U-Haul hereunder.  The
     term "Gross Revenue" shall mean all receipts (excluding security
     deposits unless and until Owner recognizes the same as income) of
     Owner (whether or not received by U-Haul on behalf or for the account
     of Owner) arising from the operation of the Property, including
     without limitation, rental payments of lessees of space in the
     Property, vending machine or concessionaire revenues, maintenance
     charges, if any, paid by the tenants of the Property in addition to
     basic rent, parking fees, if any, and all monies whether or not
     otherwise described herein paid for the use of the Property.  "Gross
     Revenue" shall be determined on a cash basis.  The Management Fee
     shall be paid promptly at the end of each calendar quarter and shall
     be calculated on the basis of the "Gross Revenue" of such preceding
     quarter.  The Management Fee shall be paid to each U-Haul property
     manager herein identified based on the Gross Revenue of each
     respective Property for which such property manager is responsible as
     set forth on Exhibit A hereto.  Each property manager agrees that its
                  ---------
     monthly Management Fee shall be subordinate to that month's principal
     balance and interest payment on any first lien position mortgage loan
     on the Property.
<PAGE>

          It is understood and agreed that the Management Fee will not be
     reduced by the cost to Owner of those employees and independent
     contractors engaged by or for Owner, including but not limited to the
     categories of personnel specifically referred to in Section 2(d).
     Except as provided in this Section 4, it is further understood and
     agreed that U-Haul shall not be entitled to additional compensation
     of any kind in connection with the performance by it of its duties
     under this Agreement.

          (b)  REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES.  In addition to the
     Management Fee described above, U-Haul shall be entitled to
     reimbursement from Owner, on a quarterly basis, for all out-of-pocket
     expenses incurred by U-Haul hereunder in connection with the
     management and operation of the Property, including, without
     limitation, taxes, insurance, operational expenses, overhead,
     litigation and dispute resolution related expenses, capital
     improvement expenses, and costs of sales.

     5.  Use of Trademarks, Service Marks and Related Items.
         --------------------------------------------------

          Owner acknowledges the significant value of the "U-Haul" name in
     the operations of Owner's property and it is therefore understood and
     agreed that the name, trademark and service mark, "U-Haul", and
     related marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other trade or
     service items shall be utilized for the non-exclusive benefit of
     Owner in the rental and operation of the Property, and in comparable
     operations elsewhere.  It is further understood and agreed that this
     name and all such marks, slogans, caricatures, designs and other
     trade or service items shall remain and be at all times the property
     of U-Haul and its affiliates, and that, except during the term hereof
     and as expressly provided herein, Owner shall have no right
     whatsoever therein.  Owner agrees that during the term of this
     agreement the sign faces at the property will have the name "U-Haul."
     The U-Haul sign faces will be paid for by Owner.  Upon termination of
     this agreement at any time for any reason, all such use by and for
     the benefit of Owner of any such name, mark, slogan, caricature,
     design or other trade or service item in connection with the Property
     shall, in any event, be terminated and any signs bearing any of the
     foregoing shall be removed from view and no longer used by Owner.  In
     addition, upon termination of this Agreement at any time for any
     reason, Owner shall not enter into any new leases of Property using
     the U-Haul lease form or use other forms prepared by U-Haul.  It is
     understood and agreed that U-Haul will use and shall be unrestricted
     in its use of such name, mark, slogan, caricature, design or other
     trade or service item in the management and operation of other
     storage facilities both during and after the expiration or
     termination of the term of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

     6.  Termination.
         -----------

          Owner or U-Haul may terminate this Agreement with or without
     cause by giving not less than thirty days' written notice to the
     other party pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  In addition, if Owner
     fails to pay U-Haul any amounts owed under this Agreement when due,
     U-Haul may terminate this Agreement by giving Owner not less than ten
     days written notice pursuant to Section 11 hereof.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, however, U-Haul shall not resign as property manager
     of the Property until a nationally recognized and reputable successor
     property manager is available and prepared to assume property
     management responsibilities with respect to the Property in question.
     Upon termination of this Agreement, U-Haul shall promptly return to
     Owner all monies, books, records and other materials held by U-Haul
     for or on behalf of Owner.  In addition, if U-Haul has contracted to
     advertise the Property in the Yellow Pages, Owner shall, at the
     option of U-Haul, continue to be responsible for the cost of such
     advertisement and shall either (i) pay U-Haul the remaining amount
     due under such contract in a lump sum; or (ii) pay U-Haul monthly for
     the amount due under such contract.

     7.  Indemnification.
         ---------------

          Owner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of U-Haul, all
     persons and companies affiliated with U-Haul, and all officers,
     shareholders, directors, employees and agents of U-Haul and of any
     affiliated companies or persons (collectively, the "Indemnified
     Persons") harmless from any and all costs, expenses, attorneys' fees,
     suits, liabilities, judgments, damages, and claims in connection with
     the management of the Property (including the loss of use thereof
     following any damage, injury or destruction), arising from any cause
     except for the willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of
     the Indemnified Persons.  In addition, no Indemnified Person shall be
     liable for any error of judgment or for any mistake of fact or law,
     or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing hereafter,
     except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.  U-Haul
     hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Owner harmless from any and all
     costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, suits, liabilities, judgments,
     damages and claims in connection with the management of the Property
     arising from the willful misconduct of, gross negligence of, or
     breach of this Agreement by the Indemnified Persons.  In addition,
     U-Haul shall not be liable to Owner for the acts or omissions of
     U-Haul's officers, shareholders, directors, employees, and agents
     except for U-Haul's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     8.  Assignment.
         ----------

          This Agreement may be assigned by Owner in connection with any
     mortgage loan on the Property, whether pursuant to a conditional or
     unconditional, absolute assignment.  U-Haul shall have the right to
     assign this Agreement to an affiliate or a wholly or majority owned
<PAGE>
     subsidiary; provided, however, any such assignee must assume all
     obligations of U-Haul hereunder, Owner's rights hereunder will be
     enforceable against any such assignee and U-Haul shall not be
     released from its liabilities hereunder unless Owner shall expressly
     agree thereto in writing.

     9.  Headings.
         --------

          The headings contained herein are for convenience of reference
     only and are not intended to define, limit or describe the scope or

     unenforceable either in its entirety or in a particular application,
     the remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full
     force and effect and, if the subject term or provision is deemed to
     be invalid, void or unenforceable only with respect to a particular
     application, such term or provision shall remain in full force and
     effect with respect to all other applications.

     13.  Successors.
          ----------

          ---------------

          If it shall become necessary for any party hereto to engage
     attorneys to institute legal action for the purpose of enforcing
     their respective rights hereunder or for the purpose of defending
     legal action brought by the other party hereto, the party or parties
     prevailing in such litigation shall be entitled to receive all costs,
     expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
     it in such litigation (including appeals).

     15.  Counterparts.
          ------------

          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
     of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
     constitute one and the same instrument.

     16.  Scope of Property Manager Responsibility.
          ----------------------------------------

          The duties, obligations and liability of each property manager
     identified herein shall extend only so far as to relate to the
     Property for which such property manager is managing located in the
     domicile state of such property manager, as more specifically
     described on Exhibit A hereto, and no individual property manager
     hereunder shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any other
     property manager hereunder.  Each property manager shall use its best
     efforts to assist Owner in fulfilling Owner's obligations arising
     under any loan to Owner that is secured by the Property, including
     but not limited to preparing and providing financial and accounting
     reports, and maintaining the Property.  Each property manager agrees
     that it will perform its obligations hereunder according to
     reasonable industry standards, in good faith, and in a commercially
     reasonable manner.  U-Haul agrees that, in discharging its duties
     hereunder, it will not have any relationship with any of its
     affiliates that would be less favorable to Owner than would
     reasonably be available in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.
