                                   (Unaudited)

(a)           BASIS OF PRESENTATION
              The consolidated  financial  statements have been prepared by AT&T
              Corp.  (AT&T)  pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the
              Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) and, in the opinion of
              management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement
              of the consolidated results of operations,  financial position and
              cash flows for each period presented. The consolidated results for
              interim periods are not necessarily  indicative of results for the
              full year.  These financial  results should be read in conjunction
              with AT&T's Form 10-K/A for the year ended  December 31, 1998, and
              AT&T's  previously  filed  Forms  10-Q.  AT&T's  Form 10-Q for the
              period ended June 30,  1999,  includes  the  financial  results of
              Liberty Media Group (LMG) and  Tele-Communications  Inc. (TCI) for
              the period  ended June 30,  1999,  attached as  exhibits  thereto.
              AT&T's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 1999, includes the
              financial  results of LMG for the  period  ended  March 31,  1999,
              attached as an exhibit thereto.  These financial statements should
              also be read in  conjunction  with  TCI's  Form  10-K for the year
              ended  December  31, 1998,  TCI's Form 10-Q for the quarter  ended
              March 31, 1999, the financial statements of LMG for the year ended
              December 31, 1998,  included in AT&T's Form 8-K filed on March 22,
              1999, and the financial  statements of LMG and TCI for the quarter
              and  year-to-date  periods ended  September 30, 1999,  included as
              Exhibits  99.1 and  99.2,  respectively,  to this  AT&T  quarterly
              report on Form 10-Q.

              We have  reclassified  certain prior period  amounts to conform to
              our current  presentation  and have  restated  share and per share
              information  to reflect the first  quarter  three for two split of
              AT&T's common stock and the second quarter two for one stock split
              of Liberty Media Group tracking stock.

(b)           MERGER WITH TCI
              The merger with TCI (renamed AT&T broadband and Internet  services
              or  "AB&IS")  was  completed  on March 9,  1999,  in an  all-stock
              transaction  valued at  approximately  $52  billion.  AT&T  issued
              approximately  664  million  shares  of AT&T  common  stock in the
              transaction,  of which  approximately  149 million  were  treasury
              shares.  Also in the first quarter of 1999 in connection  with the
              merger  and the  formation  of LMG from TCI's  former  programming
              business  and  technology  investments  business,  AT&T  issued  a
              separate  tracking stock designed to reflect the separate economic
              performance  of LMG.  A total of 1,080  million  shares of Class A
              Liberty Media Group Tracking Stock and 110 million shares of Class
              B Liberty  Media Group  Tracking  Stock were issued by AT&T.  AT&T
              also  issued an  additional  60 million  shares of Class A Liberty
              Media Group  Tracking  Stock in connection  with the conversion of
              certain convertible notes.

<PAGE>

                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

              AT&T does not have a controlling  financial interest for financial
              accounting purposes in LMG, therefore AT&T's investment in LMG has
              been reflected as an equity method  investment in the accompanying
              consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG
              are reflected in separate  line items "Equity  losses from Liberty
              Media Group" and  "Investment  in Liberty  Media Group and related
              receivables,  net",  in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
              statements.  As a separate  tracking stock, all of the earnings or
              losses related to LMG are excluded from the earnings  available to
              the holders of AT&T common  stock.  AB&IS' cable and certain other
              operations,   including   its   ownership   interest  in  At  Home
              Corporation  were combined  with the existing  AT&T  operations to
              form the AT&T common stock group (AT&T Group).

              The merger was recorded as a purchase.  Accordingly, the operating
              results  of  AB&IS  have  been   included   in  the   accompanying
              consolidated  financial statements since March 1, 1999, the deemed
              effective date of acquisition for accounting purposes.  The impact
              of the  results  from March 1,  1999,  through  March 9, 1999,  is
              deemed  immaterial to our  consolidated  results.  The $52 billion
              aggregate  value  assigned to AB&IS' net assets was  comprised  of
              AT&T common stock of $27  billion,  Liberty  Media Group  tracking
              stock of $23 billion,  and  assumption  of  convertible  notes and
              preferred stock of $2 billion.

              As a result of the ongoing appraisal process, in the third quarter
              of 1999  approximately  $19 billion of the  purchase  price of $52
              billion has been allocated to a franchise  intangible and is being
              amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over 40 years.  Pursuant  to
              Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting
              for Income  Taxes",  AT&T  recorded  an  approximate  $12  billion
              deferred  tax   liability  in  connection   with  this   franchise
              intangible which resulted in an increase to franchise costs. We do
              not expect that this  deferred  tax  liability  will ever be paid.
              This deferred tax liability is being  amortized on a straight-line
              basis over 40 years and is  included in the  provision  for income
              taxes.  Prior quarters'  amortization  and income tax expense have
              been  reclassified  for this  change  which  caused a decrease  to
              AT&T's  previously  reported 1999 effective tax rates. The benefit
              to the  provision  for income  taxes is offset by an  increase  in
              amortization  of franchise  costs which is recorded as a component
              of amortization  of goodwill,  franchise costs and other purchased
              intangibles,   resulting  in  no  impact  to  net  income.   Also,
              approximately  $11 billion of goodwill related to LMG was recorded
              as  part  of  our   investment   and  is  being   amortized  on  a
              straight-line  basis  over  20  years  as a  component  of  equity
              earnings  (losses)  from  Liberty  Media Group.  Approximately  $2
              billion of goodwill  related to our investment in Excite@Home  was
              recorded  in  other  investments  and  is  being  amortized  on  a
              straight-line basis over 7 years.

(c)           OTHER MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND VENTURES
              On April 30,  1999,  AT&T  completed  its  acquisition  of the IBM
              Global Network  business  (renamed AT&T Global Network Services or
              "AGNS") and its assets in the United  States.  The  acquisition is
              occurring  in  phases  throughout  1999 as  legal  and  regulatory
              requirements  are met in each of the 59  countries  in  which  the
              business  operates.  As of the end of the  third  quarter,  we had
              completed  acquisitions  representing  approximately  95%  of  the
              revenues   generated  by  businesses   which  comprise  AGNS.  The
              acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the
              operating  results of AGNS have been included in the  accompanying
              consolidated  financial  statements since the date of acquisition.
              Intangible assets of approximately $4.1 billion including customer
              lists and the excess of the purchase  price over the fair value of
              net assets acquired are being  amortized on a straight-line  basis
              over periods  ranging from five to 30 years.  The pro forma impact
              of AGNS on historical AT&T results are not material.

              On  May  28,  1999,  At  Home  Corporation  consummated  a  merger
              agreement  with Excite,  Inc.  (Excite),  a global  Internet media
              company  that  offers  consumers  and  advertisers   comprehensive
              Internet  navigation   services  with  extensive   personalization
              capabilities.  Under the terms of the  merger  agreement,  At Home
              Corporation issued  approximately 116 million shares of its common
              stock for all of the  outstanding  common  stock of  Excite.  As a
              result,   AT&T's   economic   interest  in  At  Home   Corporation
              (Excite@Home)  decreased from 38% to 26% following the merger. Due
              to the  resulting  increase  in  Excite@Home's  equity  after  the
              merger,  net of the  dilution  of  AT&T's  ownership  interest  in
              Excite@Home,  AT&T  recorded  an increase  to  additional  paid-in
              capital of $488 at September  30, 1999.  In the fourth  quarter of
              1999,  Excite@Home  agreed  to  acquire  an online  greeting  card
              company.   Upon  completion  of  that  merger,  AT&T  will  record
              additional  amounts to its additional paid-in capital as the share
              of its ownership of Excite@Home is diluted. At September 30, 1999,
              AT&T owned 94.5 million shares of Excite@Home common stock and has
              an approximate 58% voting interest on certain matters.

              On August 2, 1999,  AT&T  completed  its  acquisition  of Honolulu
              Cellular Telephone Company from BellSouth.

              In  August  1999,  AT&T and  British  Telecommunications  plc (BT)
              jointly   acquired  a  33.3%   stake  in  Rogers   Cantel   Mobile
              Communications  Inc.  (Rogers Cantel) in Canada for  approximately
              $934 in cash.  The  investment  is owned  equally  by AT&T and BT.
              Rogers  Cantel is  Canada's  largest  mobile  company  serving two
              million  customers from coast to coast.  Rogers Cantel  provides a
              complete range of wireless solutions  including  cellular,  paging
              and interactive messaging,  digital PCS and wireless data services
              marketed under the co-brand Cantel AT&T. Also in August 1999, AT&T
              sold 30% of its 31%  ownership  interest  in AT&T Canada to BT for
              approximately  $402  resulting  in a $110  pretax  gain  and a 22%
              beneficial  ownership by AT&T. AT&T and BT both contributed  their
              ownership  interest of AT&T Canada to a joint  venture that is 70%
              owned by AT&T and 30% owned by BT.

              On  September  2, 1999,  AT&T and BT acquired a 30% stake in Japan
              Telecom for $1.83 billion.

              The previously  announced  global venture  between AT&T and BT has
              received  approval  from  the  Federal  Communications  Commission
              (FCC),  the U.S. Justice  Department and the European  Commission.
              The  venture,   which  will  be  called   Concert,   will  combine
              transborder  assets and  operations  of each  company  and will be
              equally owned by both companies when operations begin. The venture
              is expected to be completed  in the fourth  quarter of 1999 and to
              begin operations on January 1, 2000.

(d)           DEBT OFFERING
              On September  14, 1999, we completed a $450  all-minority  led and
              underwritten  bond  offering  in  connection  with a  registration
              statement  filed  with  the SEC on  January  26,  1999.  The  bond
              offering  consisted of  three-year  notes due  September 15, 2002,
              with a coupon rate of 6.5%. The proceeds were utilized for general
              corporate purposes.

              On October 30, 1999, we redeemed $350 of long-term  debt which was
              funded with cash from  operations.  The early  redemption  did not
              have a material impact on our financial results.

(e)           RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES, NET
              Restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the three months ended
              September 30, 1998 were a net benefit of $517 pretax.  The benefit
              was  primarily  related  to a  $602  pretax  gain  related  to the
              settlement  of  pension   obligations  for  former  employees  who
              accepted  AT&T's  voluntary  retirement  incentive  program (VRIP)
              offer,  partially  offset by $85 of expenses  associated  with the
              merger with Teleport Communications Group Inc. (TCG), which closed
              in the third quarter of 1998.

              Restructuring   and  other  charges  for  the  nine  months  ended
              September 30, 1999, were $702 pretax.  Included in the $702 was an
              in-process  research  and  development  charge of $594  related to
              AB&IS as well as a $128 net charge  primarily  related to the exit
              of certain joint  ventures that would have competed  directly with
              Concert.  Additionally,  a $50 charge was  recorded  in the second
              quarter  related to a  contribution  agreement  AB&IS entered into
              with Phoenixstar,  Inc. (formerly Primestar,  Inc.). To the extent
              necessary,  AB&IS is required to satisfy  certain  liabilities  of
              Phoenixstar  owed  by  Phoenixstar  and  its  subsidiaries.  These
              charges  were  partially  offset  by a $70  gain  related  to  the
              settlement  of  pension   obligations  for  former  employees  who
              accepted AT&T's VRIP offer.

              Restructuring  and other  charges,  net, for the nine months ended
              September 30, 1998, were $2,827 pretax. The charge is comprised of
              a first quarter 1998 pretax charge of $601 which resulted from the
              decision not to pursue  Total  Service  Resale as a  local-service
              strategy,  a second  quarter  $2,743 net pretax  charge  primarily
              related to AT&T's  VRIP  offer,  and the third  quarter net pretax
              benefit as noted above.

(f)           EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE AND POTENTIAL COMMON SHARE
              Basic  earnings  per share  (EPS) for AT&T Group for the three and
              nine months ended  September  30, 1999 and 1998,  were computed by
              dividing income  attributable to AT&T Group common  shareowners by
              the  weighted-average  number of common shares outstanding of AT&T
              Group during the period.

              Diluted  EPS for AT&T  Group for the three and nine  months  ended
              September  30, 1999 and 1998,  was computed by dividing the income
              attributable  to AT&T Group common  shareowners,  adjusted for the
              conversion of securities, by the weighted-average number of common
              shares and dilutive  potential  common shares  outstanding of AT&T
              Group  during the period,  assuming  conversion  of the  potential
              common  shares at the beginning of the periods  presented.  Shares
              issuable  upon  conversion  of  preferred  stock of  subsidiaries,
              convertible  debt  securities  of  subsidiary,   quarterly  income
              preferred  securities,  stock options and other performance awards
              have been included in the diluted  calculation of weighted-average
              shares to the extent  that the  assumed  issuance  of such  shares
              would have been dilutive, as illustrated below.

              Income from  continuing  operations  for the three and  nine-month
              periods    ended    September    30,    1999,    of   $1,416   and
              $3,479, respectively,  include income from  continuing  operations
              attributable to AT&T Group of $1,633 and $4,297, respectively,  as
              well as losses from LMG of $217 and $818 respectively.

              A reconciliation  of the income and share components for the basic
              and diluted EPS calculations with respect to AT&T Group continuing
              operations is as follows:

              Basic  EPS for  LMG for the  third  quarter  of 1999  and  date of
              acquisition  through  September 30, 1999, was computed by dividing
              the income attributable to LMG shareowners by the weighted-average
              number of shares  outstanding  of LMG of 1.265  billion  and 1.257
              billion, respectively, for these periods. Since LMG had a loss for
              both periods,  the impact of any potential  shares would have been
              antidilutive,  and  therefore  are not  factored  into the diluted
              calculations.   There   were  52  million   potentially   dilutive
              securities outstanding at September 30, 1999.

              On September 27, 1999,  LMG announced  that the Board of Directors
              of AT&T  approved  the  repurchase  from time to time of up to 135
              million  shares of Liberty Media Group Class A or Class B tracking
              stock.


(g)           FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
              In  the  normal  course  of  business  we  use  various  financial
              instruments,   including  derivative  financial  instruments,  for
              purposes other than trading.  We do not use  derivative  financial
              instruments for speculative  purposes.  These instruments  include
              letters  of  credit,   guarantees  of  debt,  interest  rate  swap
              agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Interest rate
              swap agreements and foreign currency  exchange  contracts are used
              to  mitigate   interest  rate  and  foreign  currency   exposures.
              Collateral   is   generally   not  required  for  these  types  of
              instruments.

              September 30, 1999.

 (h)          SEGMENT REPORTING
              AT&T's  results are  segmented  according to the way we manage our
              business:  business services, consumer services, wireless services
              and broadband & Internet  services.  Our existing segments reflect
              certain  managerial  changes  since  the  publication  of our 1998
              annual  results.  The  business  services  segment was expanded to
              include  the  results  of TCG and  the  business  portion  of AT&T
              WorldNet  Service;  the consumer  services segment was expanded to
              include the residential  portion of AT&T WorldNet  Service and the
              costs   associated   with  the   development   of  fixed  wireless
              technology.  All prior results have been restated to reflect these
              changes.  In  addition,   we  established  a  new  segment  called
              broadband  & Internet  services.  Broadband  &  Internet  services
              includes  the results  associated  with  traditional  analog video
              service  as  well  as new  services  such  as  Digital  Cable  and
              AT&T@Home,  a high-speed cable Internet service.  Also included in
              this segment are the  operations  associated  with  developing and
              refining the infrastructure that will support broadband telephony.

              Reflecting the dynamics of our business,  we  continuously  review
              our management model and structure, which may result in additional
              changes to our operating segments in the future.

(i)           SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
              On  October 6, 1999,  AT&T and Dobson  Communications  Corporation
              (Dobson)  announced  the  signing  of a  definitive  agreement  to
              acquire  American  Cellular  Corporation  through a newly  created
              joint venture for $2.32 billion.  Dobson will be  responsible  for
              day to day management of the joint venture,  which will be equally
              owned and jointly  controlled by Dobson and AT&T. The  acquisition
              will be funded with  non-recourse  bank debt by the joint  venture
              and cash equity  contributions  of up to $370 from each of the two
              partners.  The Board of  Directors  of AT&T,  Dobson and  American
              Cellular have approved the transaction. The acquisition,  which is
              expected  to close in the first  quarter  of 2000,  is  subject to
              approval by American  Cellular's  shareowners,  as well as federal
              regulatory and certain other conditions.

              On  October  21,  1999,   shareowners  of  MediaOne  Group,   Inc.
              (MediaOne)  unanimously  voted  in favor  of the  proposed  merger
              between  AT&T  and  MediaOne,  pursuant  to  a  definitive  merger
              agreement  entered  into on May 6, 1999.  In  accordance  with the
              agreement,  AT&T will purchase each share of MediaOne common stock
              for $85.00 per share  consisting of 0.95 of a share of AT&T common
              stock plus $30.85 in cash. In addition, the agreement provides for
              an increase in the amount of cash  received  per share of MediaOne
              common  stock to the extent that AT&T's  stock price was less than
              $57.00  per  share.  The  additional  amount of cash  which may be
              received  is  limited  to $5.42  per  share.  AT&T  plans to issue
              approximately 613 million shares in the transaction.  Upon receipt
              of regulatory and other approvals, the merger is expected to close
              in the first quarter of 2000.

              On November 1, 1999, AT&T announced its plans to form a new public
              company,  to be named  AT&T  Latin  America,  that will  merge the
              operations of Netstream,  the competitive  local exchange  company
              AT&T is  acquiring  in Brazil,  and  FirstCom,  a publicly  traded
              company with competitive  telecommunications  operations in Chile,
              Columbia and Peru.  AT&T,  together  with Promon  Tecnologia,  its
              Brazilian partner, will contribute Netstream and $70 in cash. AT&T
              will own approximately 60% of the company,  owning Class B shares,
              with 10 votes per share. The transaction has been approved by both
              AT&T's  and  FirstCom's  Board  of  Directors.  Upon  approval  by
              FirstCom  shareowners as well as regulatory  and other  approvals,
              the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2000.
              AT&T  Latin  America  intends  to apply for  listing on the NASDAQ
              stock market.

              On November 5, 1999,  WORLDxCHANGE  Communications  announced  the
              acquisition  of ACC in  Europe  (ACC)  from  AT&T.  The  agreement
              includes ACC's principal operations in the United Kingdom, as well
              as ACC's operating  companies in France,  Germany and Italy.  AT&T
              believes it will record a pretax loss in the range of $150 to $200
              on the sale.

                       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The merger with  Tele-Communications,  Inc.  (TCI,  renamed AT&T  broadband  and
Internet  services or "AB&IS") was  completed on March 9, 1999,  in an all stock
transaction valued at approximately $52 billion.  AT&T issued  approximately 664
million shares of AT&T common stock in the transaction,  of which  approximately
149 million shares were treasury shares.  Also in connection with the merger and
the  formation  of Liberty  Media  Group  (LMG) from  TCI's  former  programming
business and technology  investments  business,  AT&T issued a separate tracking
stock designed to reflect the separate  economic  performance of LMG. A total of
1,080  million  shares of Class A Liberty  Media  Group  Tracking  Stock and 110
million  shares of Class B Liberty  Media  Group  Tracking  Stock were issued by
AT&T.  AT&T  issued an  additional  60  million  shares in  connection  with the
conversion  of  certain  convertible  notes.  AT&T  does not have a  controlling
financial  interest for financial  accounting  purposes in LMG, therefore AT&T's
investment  in LMG has been  reflected  as an equity  method  investment  in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The amounts attributable to LMG
are reflected in separate  line items  "Equity  losses from Liberty Media Group"
and  "Investment  in Liberty  Media Group and related  receivables,  net" in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial statements.  As a separate tracking stock,
all of the  earnings or losses  related to LMG are  excluded  from the  earnings
available to the holders of AT&T common stock.

The merger was recorded as a purchase.  Accordingly,  the  operating  results of
AB&IS have been included in the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements
since the date of acquisition. For accounting purposes the deemed effective date
of the acquisition is March 1, 1999,  since the impact of the results from March
1,  1999,  through  March 9,  1999,  is deemed  immaterial  to our  consolidated
results.  AB&IS' cable and certain  other  operations,  including  its ownership
interest in At Home Corporation (Excite@Home),  but excluding LMG, were combined
with the existing  operations  of AT&T to form the AT&T Common Stock Group (AT&T
Group).

We segment  our  results  based on how we manage  our  business.  The  following
businesses comprise AT&T Group: business services, consumer services,  broadband
& Internet services and wireless  services.  A fifth group, other and corporate,
includes the results of AT&T Solutions,  international  operations and ventures,
other corporate operations, overhead and eliminations. Results are discussed for
these five groups as well as for combined  AT&T Group.  The  discussion  for the
other and corporate group is further broken out to include  information for AT&T
Solutions  (which  includes the results of the Solutions  outsourcing  unit, the
internal AT&T Information  Technology Services unit, and the results of portions
of the IBM Global  Network which were acquired in the second and third  quarters
of 1999 and renamed  AT&T Global  Network  Services  (AGNS),  and  international
operations and ventures.

Operating results are discussed  separately for AT&T Group and LMG. All lines of
the  accompanying  consolidated  statements of income except for "Equity  losses
from Liberty Media Group",  "Income from continuing operations" and "Net income"
reflect  the  results  of  AT&T  Group  only.  All  lines  of  the  accompanying
consolidated  balance sheet,  except for the  "Investment in Liberty Media Group
and related receivables,  net" and the components of shareowners' equity labeled
as relating to LMG are attributable to AT&T Group only. The liquidity, financial
condition,  risk  management and year 2000  discussion  pertain to  consolidated
AT&T, including our investment in LMG.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Except  for  the  historical   statements  and  discussions   contained  herein,
statements  contained  in this Report on Form 10-Q  constitute  "forward-looking
statements"  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and

AT&T's ability to achieve a significant market penetration in new markets. These

results to differ materially from such statements.

differ  materially  from such  forward-looking  statements,  see the  discussion
thereof contained under the heading "Forward-Looking  Statements" in AT&T's Form
10-K/A for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  Readers  should also consider the
factors  discussed  under the headings  "Results of  Operations"  and "Financial
Condition"  included  in  this  Form  10-Q.  AT&T  disclaims  any  intention  or
obligation  to update or revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations  attributable to AT&T common
shareowners  were $0.50 on a diluted basis for the third  quarter of 1999,  down
from $0.78 in the third  quarter  of 1998.  Earnings  per share from  continuing
operations attributable to AT&T common shareowners were $1.39 on a diluted basis
in the first nine months of 1999,  compared with $1.20 on a diluted basis in the
first nine  months of 1998.  For the  quarterly  period,  the  decrease  was due
primarily to the impacts of AB&IS and AGNS,  the 1998 benefit for  restructuring
and other charges, net, and equity losses related to Excite@Home and Cablevision
Systems  Corp.  (Cablevision),  partially  offset by increased  income from core
operations  and a gain on the sale of a business  in 1999.  For the year to date
period,  the increase was due to increased income from core operations and lower
restructuring and other charges,  net,  partially offset by the impacts of AB&IS
and AGNS,  the equity  losses for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1999,
related  to  Excite@Home  and  Cablevision  and  lower  gains  on the  sales  of
businesses in 1999.

AT&T Group's operational earnings,  which excluded certain nonoperational items,
were $0.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 1999, a decrease of 20.6%,
or $0.14, over the prior year period. Nonoperational items for the third quarter
were:
 ..Restructuring and other charges, net benefit of $0.10 in 1998
 ..Gain on sale of a business of $0.02 in 1999
 ..A loss of $0.06  reflecting  the  earnings impact of our investments in
  Excite@Home and Cablevision in 1999.

The decrease in operational  earnings for the third quarter was due primarily to
the impact of AB&IS.

Excluding  the  impacts  of both AB&IS and AGNS,  operational  EPS for the third
quarter of 1999 was $0.81,  an increase of 19.1%,  or $0.13,  compared  with the
third  quarter  of 1998.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to higher  revenues
combined with improving margins.

AT&T Group's operational earnings,  which excluded certain nonoperational items,
were $1.63 per diluted  share for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999, a
decrease of 2.4%, or $0.04, over the prior year period. Nonoperational items for
the first nine months were:
 ..Restructuring and other charges, net, of $0.21 in 1999 and $0.64 in 1998
 ..Gains on sales of businesses of $0.07 in 1999 and $0.17 in 1998
 ..A $0.02  benefit in 1999 from changes in tax rules with respect to the
  utilization  of  acquired  net  operating  losses
 ..A  loss  of  $0.12  in 1999 reflecting the earnings impact of our investment
  in Excite@Home and Cablevision.

The decrease in  operational  earnings for the nine months ended  September  30,
1999 was due primarily to the impact of AB&IS.

Excluding  the  impacts  of both  AB&IS and AGNS,  operational  EPS for the nine
months ended  September  30, 1999,  was $2.23,  an increase of 33.5%,  or $0.56,
compared with the prior year period  primarily due to higher  revenues  combined
with improving margins.

LMG's loss per share was $0.17 for the quarter  ended  September  30, 1999,  and
$0.65 for the period from the date of acquisition through September 30, 1999.

The results of AT&T Group and our  investment  in LMG are  discussed  in further
detail below.

Total  revenues  on a reported  basis  increased  19.2% to $16,270  million  and
increased  16.0% to $46,057  million for the three and nine-month  periods ended
September 30, 1999,  respectively,  compared with the  corresponding  prior year
periods.  Excluding AB&IS and AGNS,  revenues  increased 5.3% to $14,372 million
for the third quarter of 1999 and increased 5.9% to $42,042 million for the nine
months  ended  September  30,  1999,  compared  with the  comparable  prior year
periods. The increases for both periods were due to growth in wireless services,
business services and AT&T Solution's outsourcing services,  partially offset by
lower consumer services  revenues.  Revenues on a pro forma basis, which include
the results of AB&IS  (adjusted  to exclude all closed  cable  partnerships  and
Excite@Home)  and the impact of the closed portions of AGNS for a full period in
both 1999 and 1998,  increased  5.6% for the third quarter of 1999 and increased
6.2%  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  1999,   compared  with  the
corresponding prior year periods.

Access and other  interconnection  expenses decreased $165 million,  or 4.3%, to
$3,654  million in the third  quarter of 1999 compared with the third quarter of
1998. Access and other interconnection expenses decreased $595 million, or 5.1%,
to $11,054 million in the first nine months of 1999 compared with the first nine
months of 1998.  The declines were  primarily  driven by mandated  reductions in
per-minute access charges and lower negotiated  international  settlement rates.
These  declines were  partially  offset by total long distance  volume growth of
8.9% for the quarter and 8.5% on a year-to-date basis. For the quarterly period,
increased  per-line  charges (Primary  Interexchange  Carrier Charges or "PICC")
also partially offset the declines.

  services........................... $3,869   $2,648      $10,515   $7,746

Network and other communications  services expenses increased $1,221 million, or
46.1%,  to $3,869  million in the third  quarter of 1999  compared with the same
period last year. Network and other  communications  services expenses increased
$2,769  million,  or 35.7%,  to $10,515 million in the first nine months of 1999
compared  with the same  period  last year.  Excluding  the impacts of AB&IS and
AGNS, network and other communications services expenses increased 3.6% and 6.2%
for the three and  nine-month  periods ended  September 30, 1999,  respectively,
compared with the same periods last year.  These increases were primarily driven
by the growing wireless  subscriber base largely  attributable to the success of
AT&T  Digital One Rate  service  which  resulted in higher  off-network  roaming
charges,  higher  costs and volume of handsets and an  increased  provision  for
uncollectibles.  A  portion  of the  increase  was  also due to  growth  in AT&T
Solutions.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by  network  cost  control
initiatives,  lower per call compensation  expense due to a favorable FCC ruling
in the first  quarter  of 1999,  and a lower  provision  for  uncollectibles  in
consumer  services.  For the  year to  date  period,  the  increases  were  also
partially   offset  by  lower   nonincome   taxes  and  a  lower  provision  for
uncollectibles in business services.

Amortization  of  goodwill,  franchise  costs  and other  purchased  intangibles
increased $296 million,  or 471.4%, from the third quarter of 1998 and increased
$712 million,  or 378.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, compared
with  the  same  periods  last  year.   Franchise   costs  represent  the  value
attributable to the agreement with local  authorities that allow access to homes
in AB&IS'  service  areas.  Other  purchased  intangibles  arising from business
combinations  primarily include customer lists and licenses.  The increases were
primarily  driven by AB&IS.  AT&T also has  amortization of goodwill  associated
with  nonconsolidated  investments  recorded  as a  component  of  other  income
(expense)  amounting  to  $164  million  and  $356  million  for the  three  and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999,  respectively,  and $14 million and
$43 million for the three and  nine-month  periods  ended  September  30,  1998,
respectively.

Depreciation and other amortization  expenses increased $419 million,  or 36.9%,
in the third  quarter of 1999 and increased  $1,195  million,  or 37.2%,  in the
first nine months of 1999  compared with the  corresponding  prior year periods.
Excluding AB&IS and AGNS, depreciation and other amortization expenses increased
14.7% and 19.2% for the three and nine-month  periods ended  September 30, 1999,
respectively,  compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The increases
were  primarily due to growth in AT&T Group's  depreciable  asset base resulting
from the continued  infrastructure  investment throughout 1998 and 1999. Capital
expenditures,  including  AB&IS and AGNS, were $3.6 billion for the three months
ended  September 30, 1999, and $7.9 billion for the nine months ended  September
30, 1999. The capital expenditures for both periods focused on cable operations,
data services, wireless services and business local services.

Selling,  general and administrative  (SG&A) expenses increased $296 million, or
9.4%, to $3,442 million in the third quarter of 1999 and increased $289 million,
or 3.0%,  to $10,060  million  for the nine months  ended  September  30,  1999,
compared with the  corresponding  prior year periods.  Excluding AB&IS and AGNS,
SG&A expenses  declined 2.4% for the third quarter of 1999 and declined 5.3% for
the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  versus the  corresponding  prior year
periods. These reductions reflect reduced marketing and sales expenses resulting
primarily from  reductions in consumer  acquisition  program  spending and other
cost-control  initiatives.  These  reductions were partially offset by increased
spending in the company's growth businesses,  including wireless services due to
increased subscribers and customer care spending,  and for the quarterly period,
the AT&T Solutions  outsourcing unit. Including AB&IS and AGNS, SG&A expenses as
a  percentage  of  revenues  were  21.2% and 21.8% for the three and  nine-month
periods ended September 30, 1999, respectively, compared with 23.0% and 24.6% in
the prior year  periods.  SG&A  expenses  excluding  wireless  services  and the
consumer local business as a percentage of revenues were 18.8% and 19.7% for the
three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999.

Restructuring  and other charges,  net for the three months ended  September 30,
1998,  were a net benefit of $517  million  pretax.  The  benefit was  primarily
related to a $602  million  pretax  gain  related to the  settlement  of pension
obligations  for former  employees  who  accepted  AT&T's  voluntary  retirement
incentive  program  (VRIP)  offer,  partially  offset by $85 million of expenses
associated with the merger with Teleport  Communications Group Inc. (TCG), which
closed in the third quarter of 1998.

Restructuring  and other  charges for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,
were  $702  million  pretax.  Included  in the $702  million  was an  in-process
research and  development  charge of $594 million  related to AB&IS as well as a
$128 million net charge primarily  related to the exit of certain joint ventures
that would have competed directly with Concert,  the global venture that AT&T is
forming with British  Telecommunications plc (BT).  Additionally,  a $50 million
charge was recorded in the second quarter  related to a  contribution  agreement
AB&IS entered into with Phoenixstar,  Inc.  (formerly  Primestar,  Inc.). To the
extent  necessary,   AB&IS  is  required  to  satisfy  certain   liabilities  of
Phoenixstar  owed  by  Phoenixstar  and its  subsidiaries.  These  charges  were
partially  offset by a $70 million  gain  related to the  settlement  of pension
obligations for former employees who accepted AT&T's VRIP offer.

The in-process  research and development  projects  related to AB&IS' efforts to
offer voice over Internet  protocol,  cost savings  efforts for cable  telephony
implementation and product integration efforts for advanced set-top devices that
would enable AB&IS to offer next-generation digital services. Although there are
significant  technological issues to overcome in order to successfully  complete
the acquired  in-process  research  and  development,  AT&T  expects  successful
completion.  AT&T  currently  anticipates  that (i) it will deploy  equipment to
offer voice over  Internet  protocol to two cities in the year 2001,  (ii) field
deployable  devices  will be  available  by the end of the year with  respect to
AT&T's cost savings efforts for cable telephony implementation,  and (iii) field
trials will begin in mid-year 2000 for  next-generation  digital  services.  If,
however,  AT&T is unable to establish  technological  feasibility  and produce a
commercially viable  product/service,  then anticipated  incremental future cash
flows attributable to expected profits from such new  product/service may not be
realized.

Restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the nine months ended  September 30,
1998,  were $2,827  million  pretax.  The charge is comprised of a first quarter
1998 pretax  charge of $601  million  which  resulted  from the  decision not to
pursue Total Service  Resale as a  local-service  strategy,  the second  quarter
$2,743 million net pretax charge primarily related to AT&T's VRIP offer, and the
third quarter net pretax benefit as noted above.

Other income (expense)............... $ (409)  $  156       $ (334)  $1,169

For the three months ended September 30, 1999, other income (expense)  decreased
$565  million,  or  360.7%,  to an expense of $409  million  compared  with $156
million of income in the third quarter of 1998. The decrease  primarily resulted
from  higher  equity  losses  and  goodwill  amortization  associated  with  our
nonconsolidated  investments,  largely due to Excite@Home and Cablevision.  Also
contributing to the decrease were  distributions on trust preferred  securities,
as well as higher interest income in 1998 on the proceeds received from the sale
of Universal Card Services  (UCS).  Partially  offsetting  these decreases was a
1999  third  quarter  pretax  gain of $110  million  on the sale of a portion of
AT&T's ownership interest in AT&T Canada.

Other income  (expense)  decreased $1,503 million,  or 128.6%,  to an expense of
$334 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  compared with $1,169
million  of income in the first  nine  months of 1998.  The  decrease  primarily
resulted from higher equity losses and goodwill amortization associated with our
nonconsolidated  investments,  largely due to Excite@Home and Cablevision.  Also
contributing  to the decrease  were first quarter 1998 pretax gains on the sales
of AT&T Solutions  Customer Care (ASCC) of $350 million,  LIN  Television  Corp.
(LIN-TV) of $317 million, and a second quarter 1998 gain on the sale of SmarTone
Telecommunications Holdings Limited (SmarTone) of $103 million. In addition, the
decline  reflects higher  interest income in 1998 on the proceeds  received from
the sale of UCS.  Partially  offsetting these decreases was a first quarter 1999
pretax gain on the sale of the AT&T Language Line  Services  business  (Language
Line) of $153 million,  a second quarter 1999 pretax gain on the sale of WOOD-TV
of $88 million, and a third quarter 1999 pretax gain on the sale of a portion of
our ownership interest in AT&T Canada of $110 million.

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
 (EBIT)...............................$2,980   $3,512       $8,084   $5,470

EBIT decreased $532 million, or 15.2%, to $2,980 million,  for the third quarter
of 1999 compared with the third quarter of 1998 and increased $2,614 million, or
47.8%, to $8,084 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  compared
with the nine months ended September 30, 1998. Excluding AB&IS and AGNS, as well
as  restructuring  and other  charges,  net,  and certain  gains on the sales of
businesses,  EBIT increased $464 million,  or 15.5%, to $3,459 million,  for the
third  quarter of 1999  compared  with the third  quarter of 1998 and  increased
$2,124 million,  or 28.2%, to $9,651 million for the nine months ended September
30,  1999,  compared  with the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1998.  These
increases  were due  primarily to revenue  increases  combined with an improving
cost structure,  partially offset by lower interest income and  distributions on
trust preferred  securities  issued in 1999. AT&T remains  committed to reducing
the cost of doing  business  by  cutting $2 billion in costs by the end of 2000.
However, as we continue to invest in growth businesses, total operating expenses
are expected to increase.

AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus other income and is a measure used
by our chief operating  decision-makers to measure AT&T's consolidated operating
results and to measure segment  profitability.  Interest and taxes are generally
not allocated to our segments because debt is managed and serviced and taxes are
managed and calculated on a centralized basis.  Trends in interest and taxes are
discussed  separately on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes EBIT is a
meaningful  measure to disclose to investors because it provides  investors with
an analysis  of  operating  results  using the same  measures  used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of AT&T,  provides a return on total  capitalization
measure,  and allows investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each
segment in relation to consolidated AT&T. Our calculation of EBIT may or may not
be consistent with the calculation of EBIT by other public  companies,  and EBIT
should  not be viewed by  investors  as an  alternative  to  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or
to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity.

Interest expense increased $345 million, or 301.4%, in the third quarter of 1999
compared with the third quarter of 1998. For the nine months ended September 30,
1999, interest expense increased $786 million, or 244.1%, compared with the nine
months ended  September 30, 1998.  These  increases were  primarily  driven by a
higher level of average debt outstanding  associated with our acquisitions.  For
the  quarterly  period,  the increase was  partially  offset by a lower  average
interest rate.

Provision for income taxes............ $ 888   $1,275       $2,679   $1,901

The provision for income taxes decreased $387 million, or 30.4%, to $888 million
in the third  quarter  of 1999  compared  with the third  quarter of 1998 due to
lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate. Effective tax
rates for the third quarter of 1999 and 1998 were 35.2% and 37.5%, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the pooling of TCG's
historical   operating   results   which  did  not  include   tax   benefits  on
pre-acquisition  losses in 1998 and certain foreign legal entity  restructurings
in 1999.

The  provision for income taxes  increased  $778  million,  or 40.9%,  to $2,679
million for the nine months ended  September  30, 1999,  compared  with the nine
months ended  September  30, 1998,  due primarily to higher income before income
taxes. Effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998
were 38.4% and 36.9%,  respectively.  In the first  quarter of 1999,  AT&T Group
recorded a non-tax deductible  in-process  research and development  charge, and
accordingly,  no tax benefit was recorded.  During the second quarter of 1999, a
change in the net operating loss utilization tax rules resulted in a $75 million
reduction in the second quarter  income tax provision.  Excluding the impacts of
the  in-process  research  and  development  charge  and the  change  in the net
operating  loss  utilization  tax rules in 1999,  the effective tax rate for the
nine months ended September 30, 1999, was 36.4%. The change in the effective tax
rate was impacted by the pooling of TCG's historical operating results which did
not  include  tax  benefits on  pre-acquisition  losses in 1998,  the impacts of
certain  1998   investment   dispositions   and  certain  foreign  legal  entity
restructurings in both periods.

Other Items
In April 1998 AT&T sold UCS for $3,500  million,  resulting in an after-tax gain
of $1,290  million,  or $0.47 per diluted  share,  reflected as "Gain on Sale of
Discontinued Operations" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In August 1998, AT&T extinguished $1,046 million of TCG's debt. The $217 million
early  extinguishment  of  debt  was  recorded  as an  extraordinary  loss.  The
after-tax impact was $137 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

Income available to AT&T shareowners decreased $353 million, or 17.7%, to $1,633
million in the third quarter of 1999,  driven  primarily by the impacts of AB&IS
and AGNS, the 1998 benefit in restructuring  and other charges,  net, and equity
losses for the third  quarter of 1999 related to  Excite@Home  and  Cablevision,
partially offset by increased income from core operations, an extraordinary loss
on the  extinguishment  of debt  recognized in the third quarter of 1998 and the
gain on the sale of a business in 1999.  Income  available  to AT&T  shareowners
decreased $113 million,  or 2.6%, to $4,297 million for the first nine months of
1999 driven  primarily by the 1998 gain on the sale of discontinued  operations,
the  impacts of AB&IS and AGNS,  the equity  losses  for the nine  months  ended
September 30, 1999,  related to Excite@Home  and  Cablevision and lower gains on
the  sales of  businesses  in 1999.  These  declines  were  partially  offset by
increased income from core operations, lower restructuring and other charges and
an  extraordinary  loss on the  extinguishment  of debt  recognized in the third
quarter of 1998.

AT&T GROUP SEGMENT RESULTS

Business Services
The business  services  segment results reflect sales of long distance and local
voice  and  data  services  to  business  customers,   including:  domestic  and
international;   inbound  and  outbound;   intra-LATA  toll;  calling  card  and
operator-handled services, and other network enabled services. This segment also
includes electronic commerce and  Internet-protocol  (IP) for business customers
such as Web site hosting and AT&T WorldNet business Internet access.

Consumer Services
The   consumer    services   segment   includes   the   results   of   providing
telecommunications  services to  residential  customers  including  domestic and
international long distance services, intra-LATA toll services, calling-card and
operator-handled  calling services, and prepaid calling cards. In addition, this
segment  includes AT&T WorldNet  residential  Internet access service,  noncable
local services  provided to residential  customers and the costs associated with
the development of fixed wireless technology.

Wireless Services
The  results  of this  segment  are  comprised  primarily  of sales of  wireless
services and products to customers in AT&T Group's 850 MHz  (cellular)  and 1900
MHz (PCS) markets.  The results of AT&T's former messaging business are included
in 1998 results through October 2, when the unit was sold.

Broadband & Internet Services
AB&IS includes the results associated with traditional analog video service,  as
well as new services,  such as Digital Cable and AT&T@Home,  a high-speed  cable
Internet  access  service.  AT&T@Home,  along with  several  other  large  cable
operators,  has a  contract  with  Excite@Home,  the  operator  of  an  Internet
"backbone",  over which we can provide  high-speed cable Internet service.  Also
included in this  segment are the  operations  associated  with  developing  and
refining the infrastructure that will support broadband telephony.

Other and Corporate
This  group   includes  the  results  of  AT&T   Solutions   (including   AGNS),
international operations and ventures, other corporate operations,  overhead and
eliminations.

The above segments  reflect  certain changes since the publication of our annual
results due to changes in the way we manage our business.  The business services
segment was expanded to include the results of TCG and the  business  portion of
AT&T WorldNet Service; the consumer services segment was expanded to include the
residential  portion of AT&T WorldNet  Service and the costs associated with the
development of fixed wireless  technology.  All prior results have been restated
to reflect these changes.

The discussion of segment  results for AT&T Group generally  includes  revenues;
earnings  before  interest and taxes,  including  other income (EBIT);  earnings
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization,  including other income
(EBITDA);  capital additions and total assets. The discussion of EBITDA for AT&T
Group's wireless services and broadband & Internet services segments is modified
to exclude other income.

AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus other income and is a measure used
by our chief operating  decision-makers to measure AT&T's consolidated operating
results and to measure segment  profitability.  Interest and taxes are generally
not allocated to our segments because debt is managed and serviced and taxes are
managed and calculated on a centralized basis.  Trends in interest and taxes are
discussed  separately on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes EBIT is a
meaningful  measure to disclose to investors because it provides  investors with
an analysis  of  operating  results  using the same  measures  used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of AT&T,  provides a return on total  capitalization
measure,  and allows investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each
segment in relation to consolidated AT&T. Our calculation of EBIT may or may not
be consistent with the calculation of EBIT by other public  companies,  and EBIT
should  not be viewed by  investors  as an  alternative  to  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or
to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity.

EBITDA is also used by  management  as a measure of segment  performance  and is
defined as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization.  We believe it is meaningful
to investors as a measure of each  segment's  liquidity and allows  investors to
evaluate a segment's  liquidity using the same measure that is used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of AT&T.  Consolidated  EBITDA is also  provided for
comparison purposes. Our calculation of EBITDA may or may not be consistent with
the calculation of EBITDA by other public  companies and should not be viewed by
investors  as an  alternative  to  GAAP  measures  of  income  as a  measure  of
performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities
as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into effect changes
in certain assets and liabilities which can affect cash flow.

Total  assets  for  each  segment  include  all  assets,   except   inter-entity
receivables.  Deferred taxes,  prepaid pension assets,  and  corporate-owned  or
leased real estate are generally  held at the corporate  level and therefore are
primarily  included in the other and corporate group.  Shared network assets are
allocated to the segments and reallocated  each January,  based on the prior two
years' volumes of minutes used.

Capital  additions  for each segment  include  additions to property,  plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets including licenses, investments, franchise
costs and capitalized software.

REVENUES
Business  services  revenues  increased  5.0% in the third quarter of 1999,  and
increased 6.4% for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  compared with the
prior year.  The  increase  for the quarter was  primarily  driven by  continued
strength in data services which  includes  Internet  Protocol (IP) services,  as
well as increases  in local voice  services.  The increase for the  year-to-date
period was primarily  driven by data  services,  domestic  long  distance  voice
services  and local voice  services.  Total  calling  volumes for both  periods,
including  local services,  increased  about 25% over the prior year;  excluding
local services, volumes increased at a mid-teens growth rate for the quarter and
year-to-date periods.

Data services  revenues grew at a mid-teens  rate for the third quarter of 1999.
The  increase  was led by  continued  growth in frame relay as well as growth in
international and high-speed  private line services.  Data services for the 1999
year-to-date period grew in the high-teens, due primarily to continued growth in
frame relay and high-speed private line services. The data revenues growth rates
were negatively impacted by 1998 billing  adjustments.  The data services growth
was augmented by significant growth in IP services,  such as AT&T WorldNet,  for
both  periods.  Packet  services  (frame  relay,  ATM and IP) grew over 50% on a
combined  basis  for the  quarter  and  approximately  65% for the  year-to-date
period.

Long  distance  voice  revenues  grew at a  low-single-digit  rate for the third
quarter and for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999,  compared  with the
prior year periods. Strong volume increases were partially offset by a declining
average  price per  minute.  The  average  price per minute has been  negatively
impacted  by the  competitive  forces  within  the  industry  which we expect to
continue.  In  addition,  the price per minute has been  negatively  impacted by
changes in product mix, largely attributable to an increase in wholesale,  which
has a lower rate per minute.

Local voice service  revenues,  which  included  domestic ACC revenues since its
acquisition  in April 1998,  grew nearly 70% in the third quarter and first nine
months of 1999,  compared  with the  corresponding  prior year  periods.  AT&T's
integrated  business  local  operations,  including  AT&T  Digital  Link,  added
approximately  164 thousand  access lines in the third  quarter and total access
lines in service as of September 30, 1999, reached  approximately 1.1 million on
a restated  basis.  The number of access lines was restated and now represents a
more  comprehensive view of our bundled strategy as it now includes all channels
capable  of  providing  local  traffic.  Prior  period  amounts  have  also been
restated.  AT&T serves 32,809  buildings in 87  metropolitan  statistical  areas
(MSAs), with over 17% of the buildings on-network.

Internal revenues  increased 86.7% and 69.1% for the three and nine months ended
September  30, 1999,  respectively.  The  increases  were due to higher sales of
business long distance  services to other AT&T units,  primarily  AT&T Solutions
(including  the  impact  of AGNS)  and  wireless  services,  for  resale to AT&T
Solutions and wireless services customers.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA for  business  services  increased  13.0% to $1,537  million and
13.8% to $2,257  million,  respectively,  in the third  quarter of 1999 compared
with the prior year  quarter.  EBIT and EBITDA for business  services  increased
26.7% to $4,563 million and 25.6% to $6,715 million,  respectively, for the nine
months ended September 30, 1999,  compared with the prior year. The improvements
were driven by the growth in revenues  and margin  improvement.  EBIT and EBITDA
margins were  positively  impacted by an improved cost  structure as a result of
cost control initiatives in 1999. The EBIT and EBITDA growth rates have declined
from the prior quarter due to increased costs associated with volume  increases,
price  declines  and strong  third  quarter 1998 results due to the reduced cost
structure due to headcount reductions associated with VRIP.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  for  business  services  were  $1,821  million for the third
quarter of 1999 and were $4,316 million for the nine months ended  September 30,
1999.  Capital  additions  were $1,509 million for the third quarter of 1998 and
were $3,685  million for the nine months ended  September 30, 1998.  Spending in
both 1999 and 1998 was primarily  directed  towards the long  distance  network,
including SONET, as well as spending on the local network.  In 1998 spending was
also directed towards circuit switch equipment.

Total assets increased $1,963 million,  or 9.2%, to $23,378 million at September
30, 1999,  compared  with  December 31,  1998,  primarily  due to an increase in
property, plant and equipment as a result of capital additions.

REVENUES
Consumer services revenues  decreased 4.7% and 3.8% for the three and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 1999,  respectively,  compared with the same periods
last year. Excluding AT&T WorldNet Service, revenues were down 5.1% and 4.3% for
the three and nine-month  periods ended September 30, 1999,  respectively.  Long
distance calling volumes declined at a  mid-single-digit  rate for both periods.
These  results  reflect the  competitive  nature of the consumer  long  distance
industry.  Lower revenues reflect the company's strategy to migrate higher-usage
customers to optional  calling  plans in order to optimize the customer base for
future growth.

In August 1999, AT&T introduced One Rate 7sm, a simple,  convenient calling plan
that allows  consumers to make long distance  calls 24 hours a day, seven days a
week for seven-cents a minute.  The plan requires a monthly fee of $5.95 that is
reduced to $4.95 for  customers  who select AT&T as their  intra-LATA  provider.
Initial customer response to One Rate 7 has exceeded expectations.  In the first
five  weeks,  nearly 2 million  customers  subscribed  to the plan with over 60%
choosing  AT&T  for  intra-LATA  service.  New  and  existing  Personal  Network
subscribers also receive the seven-cent rate on long distance calling as part of
the bundled package.

Consumer WorldNet Service revenues  increased 44.3% in the third quarter of 1999
over the prior year quarter to $79  million.  Revenues  increased  46.7% for the
nine months ended  September  30, 1999,  to $220 million  compared with the nine
months ended  September 30, 1998.  AT&T WorldNet  Service now serves 1.5 million
residential subscribers, an increase of 44.8% from a year ago.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA for consumer services  increased 23.3% and 22.9%,  respectively,
in the third  quarter of 1999  compared with the third quarter of the prior year
and increased 27.9% and 27.0%, respectively, for the nine months ended September
30, 1999,  compared  with the nine months  ended  September  30, 1998.  EBIT and
EBITDA for consumer  services  excluding the first quarter 1999 gain on the sale
of Language Line increased  24.5% and 24.1%,  respectively,  for the nine months
ended  September 30, 1999,  over the same period last year. The increase for the
quarter  was driven  primarily  by lower  negotiated  settlement  rates and cost
reduction  efforts,  primarily  in  marketing  spending.  The  increase  for the
year-to-date period, excluding the gain on the sale of Language Line, was driven
primarily by cost reduction  efforts,  primarily in marketing spending and lower
negotiated settlement rates.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions for consumer services were $191 million for the third quarter
of 1999 and were $449  million for the nine months  ended  September  30,  1999.
Capital  additions were $130 million for the third quarter of 1998 and were $329
million for the nine months ended September 30, 1998. Spending in both years was
primarily directed towards the long distance network.

Total assets  increased  $346  million,  or 5.3%,  to $6,907  million  primarily
associated  with the  purchase of SmarTalk  in the first  quarter of 1999.  Also
contributing  to  the  increase  was  capital  additions,  partially  offset  by
increased accumulated depreciation.

REVENUES
Wireless  services'  revenues  increased  $630 million,  or 44.2%,  in the third
quarter of 1999, and increased  $1,593  million,  or 40.9%,  for the nine months
ended  September  30,  1999,  compared  with same  periods  last year.  Wireless
services' 1999 results include Vanguard  Cellular  Systems  (Vanguard) since its
acquisition  on May 3, 1999,  and 1998 results  include our  messaging  business
until the sale date of October 2, 1998.  Adjusted to exclude  both  Vanguard and
our  messaging  business,  revenues  grew  40.9%  and  41.1%  for the  three and
nine-month  periods ended  September 30, 1999,  respectively,  compared with the
prior year  periods.  The growth for both  periods  was driven by the  continued
successful  execution of AT&T's  wireless  strategy of targeting  and  retaining
high-value subscribers,  expanding the national wireless footprint,  focusing on
digital service, and offering simple rate plans, which has resulted in increased
subscribers and rising average revenue per subscriber.

AT&T  continues  to  experience  growth in  wireless  subscribers.  Consolidated
subscribers grew 34.8% from a year ago to approximately 9.2 million at September
30, 1999, including  approximately 700 thousand subscribers from our acquisition
of Vanguard and approximately  125 thousand  subscribers from our acquisition of
Honolulu Cellular  Telephone  Company  (Honolulu) in August 1999. Net subscriber
additions  totaled 269 thousand  during the third  quarter,  down 17.4% from the
prior year quarter. Net subscriber additions declined as a result of a reduction
in  acquisition  marketing  efforts  in some  markets  due to  network  capacity
challenges and a supply shortage of digital multi-network phones in the quarter.
Total subscribers,  including  partnership  markets in which AT&T does not own a
controlling interest,  were nearly 12 million at the end of the third quarter of
1999.

AT&T's  focus on  high-value  subscribers  has helped  generate  rising usage by
customers and increased  quarterly average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU across
all of AT&T's  wireless  markets was $67.9 in the third quarter,  an increase of
14.9% from the third quarter of 1998 and a 2.6% increase from the second quarter
of 1999. This represents the fourth consecutive  quarter ARPU has increased over
the prior year.

The  company   continues  to  rapidly  migrate  customers  to  digital  service,
generating more efficient use of the network while also reducing  customer churn
compared to analog  service.  At the end of the third quarter of 1999,  73.2% of
AT&T's nearly 9.2 million  consolidated  subscribers were on digital service, up
from 52.7% one year ago and up from 69.0% one quarter ago.

EBIT/EBITDA EXCLUDING OTHER INCOME
EBIT was $69 million for the quarter,  an increase of $22 million over the prior
year period. The increase is primarily due to higher revenues,  partially offset
by increased costs from higher off-network roaming expenses,  increased customer
care and  customer  acquisition  costs and lower equity  earnings.  EBIT was $93
million for the nine months ended  September  30, 1999, a decrease of 64.3% over
the prior year  period.  Excluding  the second  quarter 1998 gain on the sale of
SmarTone,  EBIT  decreased  41.1% for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,
compared  with the prior  year  period.  The EBIT  decline  for the  period  was
primarily due to increased costs from higher off-network  roaming expenses,  and
increased customer care and customer  acquisition costs associated with the high
growth of subscriber  additions.  In addition,  EBIT was also impacted by higher
depreciation  and  amortization  as a result  of a larger  asset  base and lower
equity  earnings in the current period.  EBITDA  excluding other income was $404
million and $935  million,  for the three and nine months  ended  September  30,
1999,  respectively,  representing  increases  of 53.3% and 24.7% over the prior
year periods.  The improvement for both periods was the result of revenue growth
and an improving cost structure.  These improvements  occurred despite increased
costs from higher off-network roaming and increased customer care spending.

Off-network  roaming expenses  continued to negatively impact results,  but at a
declining rate compared to earlier quarters, as initiatives have been introduced
to  aggressively  capture  more  minutes  on the AT&T  network as well as reduce
intercarrier  roaming rates. AT&T continues to address off-network usage through
capital  expansion,  acquisitions and affiliate  launches.  Capital expansion is
underway  within  existing and new markets,  including  Columbus,  Ohio;  Omaha,
Nebraska; San Diego, California;  and certain Connecticut cities. In April 1999,
we acquired  Bakersfield  Cellular.  In May 1999, AT&T completed its merger with
Vanguard,  adding  more than 700  thousand  subscribers  and  increasing  AT&T's
wireless  coverage  in  suburban  and  rural  markets  in the  Ohio  Valley  and
Northeastern  U.S. In August 1999,  AT&T completed its  acquisition of Honolulu,
adding approximately 125 thousand customers and providing its mainland customers
with  wireless  services in Honolulu  and Maui.  Partnership  affiliations  with
Cincinnati  Bell  Wireless,  Triton PCS Holdings,  Inc.,  Telecorp PCS, Inc. and
Tritel  Inc.  further  expand  AT&T's  Time  Division   Multiple  Access  (TDMA)
footprint.  Intercarrier  roaming  rates have also declined  significantly  as a
result of  renegotiated  roaming  agreements  and the  deployment of Intelligent
Roaming  Database  (IRDB)  technology,  which assists in  identifying  favorable
roaming  partners in areas not  included in our wireless  network.  All of these
efforts have resulted in a 20% and 10% reduction in average  incollect  rate per
minute for the third  quarter of 1999 and for nine months  ended  September  30,
1999, respectively, compared with the same periods last year.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  increased $468 million,  or 226.2%,  in the third quarter of
1999,  compared with the third quarter of 1998. Capital additions increased $890
million,  or 147.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, compared with
the nine months ended  September 30, 1998.  These  increases  were the result of
additional  spending to upgrade and increase  capacity in existing  markets,  as
well as to expand our national footprint.

Total assets increased $2,823 million, or 14.8%, to $21,938 million at September
30,  1999,  from  December  31,  1998,  primarily  due to increases in goodwill,
licensing  costs  and  property,   plant  and  equipment   associated  with  our
acquisitions of Vanguard, Honolulu and Bakersfield Cellular. In addition, higher
net  property,  plant and  equipment  as a result of  capital  expenditures  and
increased accounts  receivable  associated with higher revenues also contributed
to the increase in assets.

REVENUES
Revenues  were  $1,442  million  for the third  quarter of 1999 and were  $3,344
million from the date of acquisition through September 30, 1999.

Broadband & Internet  services ended the third quarter of 1999 with 11.4 million
basic cable customers  passing 19.4 million homes.  AT&T had  approximately  1.7
million  Digital  Cable  customers.   The  high-speed  cable  Internet  service,
AT&T@Home,  had approximately  113,600 customers at the end of the third quarter
compared with approximately 82,800 at the end of the second quarter.

AT&T holds equity  interests in Excite@Home  and  Cablevision.  At September 30,
1999, AT&T owned 94.5 million shares of Excite@Home, representing an approximate
26% economic interest,  and 48.9 million shares of Cablevision,  representing an
approximate 32% economic  interest.  In the fourth quarter of 1999,  Excite@Home
agreed to  acquire an online  greeting  card  company.  Upon  completion  of the
merger,  it is expected that AT&T's  economic  interest in  Excite@Home  will be
further diluted.

EBIT/EBITDA EXCLUDING OTHER INCOME
EBIT was a deficit of $530  million for the third  quarter of 1999 and a deficit
of $1,763  million since  acquisition in early March of 1999.  EBITDA  excluding
other  income was $389  million for the third  quarter of 1999 and $263  million
since  acquisition.  Included in AB&IS  year-to-date  results was a $594 million
first quarter 1999 charge for in-process  research and  development and a second
quarter 1999 charge of $50 million related to a contribution  agreement  entered
into by AB&IS to satisfy certain liabilities of Phoenixstar.

OTHER ITEMS
Total assets were $55,941 million at September 30, 1999.

Capital  additions  of $1,007  million for the third  quarter of 1999 and $2,155
million since the date of  acquisition  through  September  30, 1999,  comprised
primarily of spending on cable  distribution  systems which focused primarily on
upgrading the plant bandwidth.

REVENUES
Revenues  increased  $519  million,  or  141.9%,  in the third  quarter  of 1999
compared  with the same  quarter  last  year.  Excluding  the  impacts  of AGNS,
revenues for the third quarter of 1999 were $432  million,  an increase of 17.8%
from the same quarter a year ago.  Revenue  growth was primarily  driven by AT&T
Solutions as a result of the  continued  strength of the  outsourcing  business.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by an increase in the  elimination  of
intercompany revenues.  Revenues increased $953 million, or 107.2%, for the nine
months  ended  September  30,  1999,  compared  with the same  period last year.
Excluding the impacts of AGNS,  revenues  increased $282 million,  or 31.9%, for
the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  compared with the same period in the
prior year.  The increase was primarily  driven by the growth in AT&T  Solutions
and international operations and ventures. These increases were partially offset
by an increase in the elimination of intercompany  revenues and the sale of ASCC
in 1998.

The elimination of revenues and profit generated by the sale of services between
segments is primarily a result of the sale of business long distance services to
other AT&T units.  Revenues  eliminated  in the quarter  were $427  million,  an
increase of 93.6% from the third quarter of 1998.  Revenues  eliminated  through
September 30, 1999,  year-to-date were $1,124 million, an increase of 57.0% from
the prior year.  The  increase in  eliminated  revenues is  primarily  due to an
increase in business  services sales to AT&T Solutions,  including the impact of
AGNS, and wireless services.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA decreased $614 million,  or 179.2%, and $543 million, or 117.5%,
in the third quarter of 1999 compared with the prior year quarter. Excluding the
third  quarter 1999 gain on the sale of a portion of AT&T's  equity  interest in
AT&T Canada and the third quarter 1998  restructuring  and other charge benefit,
EBIT and EBITDA  decreased $207 million and $136 million,  or 118.7% and 248.6%,
respectively,  from the third quarter of 1998. The decline was primarily  driven
by  higher  interest  income  in  1998  and  distributions  on  trust  preferred
securities  in 1999.  In  addition,  EBIT was  negatively  impacted  and  EBITDA
positively impacted by AGNS.

EBIT and EBITDA improved $2,300 million,  or 76.6% and $2,425 million, or 91.7%,
respectively,  for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  compared with the
same period last year.  Excluding the restructuring and other charges,  the 1999
gains on the sales of a portion of AT&T's  ownership  in AT&T Canada and WOOD-TV
and the first quarter 1998 gains on the sales of ASCC and LIN-TV,  EBIT was flat
for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999,  compared  with the nine months
ended  September 30, 1998, and EBITDA improved $125 million,  or 26.0%,  for the
same period.  Savings from cost control  initiatives and lower equity losses for
international  operations and ventures were offset by lower interest  income and
distributions on trust preferred  securities.  In addition,  EBIT was negatively
impacted and EBITDA was positively impacted by AGNS.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  increased $777 million,  or 471.2%,  in the third quarter of
1999 compared with the third quarter of last year.  Capital additions  increased
$1,064 million, or 250.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, compared
with the nine months  ended  September  30,  1998,  primarily  due to  increased
investment   in   international   operations   and   ventures'   nonconsolidated
subsidiaries.

Total assets at September 30, 1999, were $18,209  million  compared with $12,459
million at December 31, 1998,  which  represents a 46.1% increase.  The increase
was primarily due to goodwill  associated with AGNS.

AT&T SOLUTIONS
AT&T Solutions is our outsourcing,  network-management and professional-services
business.  AT&T  Solutions is comprised of the Solutions  outsourcing  unit, the
internal AT&T Information  Technology  Services unit, and the recently  acquired
AGNS.  During the third quarter of 1999, AT&T completed  additional  portions of
the  acquisition  in Canada,  New Zealand,  Korea,  Hong Kong,  South Africa and
Isreal.  The results of AT&T  Solutions  are included in the other and corporate
group.

REVENUES
AT&T Solutions grew revenues 245.1% for the third quarter of 1999 and 159.9% for
the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  to $983 million and $1,989  million,
respectively,  compared with the corresponding prior year periods. Excluding the
impact of AGNS,  revenues  grew 47.8% for the  quarter  and 49.5%,  for the nine
months  ended   September  30,  1999,  to  $421  million  and  $1,144   million,
respectively.  The  growth  for both  periods  was the  result of new  contracts
signings and growth from existing clients.  In addition,  AT&T Solutions manages
AT&T's internal network infrastructure and generated  approximately $421 million
in internal billings in the third quarter and $1,273 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1999,  which were recorded as a reduction to AT&T Solutions'
expenses (cost recovery).

AT&T  Solutions,  with more  than  30,000  clients,  including  IBM,  CitiGroup,
McGraw-Hill, Bank One, United Health Group, Textron, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch,
and  MasterCard  International,  has the  potential for more than $11 billion in
outsourcing revenues over the life of the signed contracts.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA were a deficit of $23 million and income of $117 million for the
third quarter of 1999,  respectively,  including AGNS. For the nine months ended
September 30, 1999,  EBIT and EBITDA were a deficit of $30 million and income of
$296 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of AGNS, EBIT and EBITDA were a
positive   $24  million  and  $94  million  for  the  third   quarter  of  1999,
respectively,  an  improvement  over $18 million and $88 million,  respectively,
reported  in the  corresponding  prior year  quarter.  EBIT and EBITDA  were $45
million and $260 million on this basis for the nine months ended  September  30,
1999, an improvement over $14 million and $219 million for the nine months ended
September  30,  1998.  Excluding  AGNS,  the  improvement  for both  periods was
primarily due to revenue  growth in AT&T  Solutions'  outsourcing  unit combined
with improving margins.  On a year-to-date  basis, the improvement was partially
offset by a lower EBIT margin on internal services billed.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions for the third quarter of 1999 were $152 million,  an increase
of 199.8% over the third quarter of 1998.  Capital additions for the nine months
ended  September  30, 1999,  were $228  million,  an increase of 112.5% over the
corresponding  prior  year  period.  The  increases  were  primarily  due to the
addition of client support equipment.

Total assets  increased $5,751 million,  or 562.1%,  from December 31, 1998, due
primarily to goodwill and other intangible  assets  associated with AGNS as well
as higher accounts receivable.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND VENTURES
International  operations and ventures include  consolidated  foreign operations
such as frame relay services in the UK, ACC, the company's international carrier
services  businesses and international  online services.  The equity earnings or
losses of AT&T's  nonconsolidated  international  joint  ventures and alliances,
such as Alestra in Mexico,  AT&T Canada  Corp.,  Rogers Cantel and Japan Telecom
are also  included.  The results of  international  operations  and ventures are
included in the other and corporate group.

REVENUES
Revenues  grew 9.8% in the third  quarter of 1999 to $316 million and grew 27.4%
to $941 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  compared with the
corresponding  periods  in 1998.  Revenue  growth  for both  periods  was led by
international  carrier  services  and  frame  relay  services  due to  increased
volumes.  A decline in ACC  revenues  due to the merger of ACC Canada  with AT&T
Canada  Corp.,  which is now accounted  for as an equity  investment,  partially
offset the increase in revenues for the quarter.  Revenue growth rates have also
been impacted by the divestment of certain nonstrategic businesses.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA  improved in the third  quarter of 1999 by $132 million and $130
million, respectively,  compared with the same period in 1998 due primarily to a
gain on the sale of a portion of AT&T's ownership interest of AT&T Canada to BT.
Excluding  this gain,  EBIT and EBITDA  improved in the third quarter of 1999 by
$22  million  and $20  million,  respectively,  due  primarily  to an  improving
financial  performance  in ventures and  alliances.  The  divestment  of certain
nonstrategic  businesses  and  improved  performance  in  international  carrier
services and frame relay  services also  contributed to the  improvement.  These
increases were partially offset by costs related to the preparation of Concert.

EBIT and EBITDA  improved for the nine months ended  September  30, 1999, by $69
million  to a deficit  of $105  million  and by $67  million to a deficit of $52
million,  respectively,  compared  with the same period in 1998.  Excluding  the
third quarter gain on the sale of a portion of AT&T's ownership interest in AT&T
Canada and the  year-to-date  net charge  related to the exit of joint  ventures
that would have competed directly with Concert,  EBIT and EBITDA improved during
the period by $87 million and $85 million, respectively,  primarily driven by an
improving  financial  performance in ventures and  alliances.  The divestment of
certain  nonstrategic  businesses  and improved  performance  in frame relay and
international  carrier  services  also  contributed  to the  improvement.  These
increases were partially offset by costs related to the preparation of Concert.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital additions increased $651 million to $690 million in the third quarter of
1999 and  increased  $943  million to $1,047  million for the nine months  ended
September 30, 1999, compared with the same periods last year. The increases were
primarily due to increased investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

Total assets were $2,538  million at September  30, 1999,  compared  with $1,915
million at December 31, 1998.  The increase was  primarily  driven by additional
investments in nonconsolidated  subsidiaries  partially offset by the divestment
of certain nonstrategic businesses.

LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP RESULTS
LMG  produces,   acquires  and   distributes   entertainment,   educational  and
informational  programming services through all available formats and media. LMG
is also engaged in electronic  retailing  services,  direct marketing  services,
advertising sales relating to programming services, infomercials and transaction
processing.  Although  LMG is wholly owned by AT&T,  it is  accounted  for as an
equity investment in the accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements since
AT&T does not have a  controlling  financial  interest for  financial  reporting
purposes in LMG.  Equity losses from LMG were $217 million for the third quarter
of 1999 and $818  million  for the period from the date of  acquisition  through
September 30, 1999.

On July 7, 1999,  Liberty  Media  Corporation  (a company in the  Liberty  Media
Group) and The Associated  Group, Inc.  (Associated)  signed a definitive merger
agreement  pursuant  to  which  LMG will  acquire  Associated  in an  all-stock,
tax-free  transaction  valued at approximately $3 billion.  Under the agreement,
Associated  shareowners  would receive an aggregate of approximately  51,778,920
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group tracking stock, subject to adjustment, and
an aggregate of approximately  19,719,274  shares of AT&T common stock. The AT&T
common  stock  issued is equal to the number of AT&T shares  held by  Associated
that will be  dividended  to AT&T and will be retired.  In addition,  Associated
also owns 23.4  million  shares of LMG Class A  tracking  stock and 5.3  million
shares of Class B  tracking  stock  that will  become  treasury  stock.  A proxy
statement/prospectus  was filed with the SEC on October 29, 1999.  Upon approval
of the stockholders of Associated, as well as the FCC and other authorities, the
transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2000.

On  September  28,  1999,  LMG  announced  that the Board of  Directors  of AT&T
approved the repurchase from time to time of up to 135 million shares of Liberty
Media Group Class A or Class B tracking stock.

Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing  operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 1999, was $7,237 million. This represents an increase
of $239 million  compared  with the nine months ended  September  30, 1998.  The
increase was driven  primarily by an increase in operating net income  excluding
depreciation and amortization,  offset by an increase in the 1999 tax payment of
approximately  $1.4 billion primarily related to the gain on the sale of UCS and
an increase in accounts receivable.

AT&T's investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of $21,353 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  compared with a net source of cash of
$6,808  million for the nine months ended  September  30, 1998.  During the nine
months  ended   September   30,  1999,   AT&T  used  $8.8  billion  for  capital
expenditures,  transferred  $5.5 billion of cash to LMG,  purchased  portions of
AGNS for $4.9 billion and loaned $1.5 billion to MediaOne Group, Inc. (MediaOne)
to pay termination fees to Comcast Corporation (Comcast). During the nine months
ended  September  30,  1998,  we  received  $5.7  billion as a  settlement  of a
receivable  in  conjunction  with  the  sale of UCS as well as $3.5  billion  in
proceeds  from the sale.  Also in 1998,  we received a total of $1.6  billion in
proceeds from the sales of LIN-TV,  ASCC and SmarTone.  Our capital  spending of
$5.1 billion was the primary use of cash during the nine months ended  September
30, 1998.

During the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1999,  the net cash  provided by
financing  activities was $10,956  million  compared with cash used in financing
activities  of $10,026  million for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1998.
During the first nine months of 1999,  AT&T  received  $8.4 billion of cash from
1999 bond  issuances,  $6.3 billion from the  issuance of  commercial  paper and
short-term  debt, and $5.0 billion from the issuance of  convertible  securities
and warrants to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). Significant uses of cash were
$3.9  billion  to fund the share  repurchase  program,  $2.1  billion  to retire
commercial paper and other short-term debt, and $2.0 billion to pay dividends on
common  stock.  In the  first  nine  months  of  1998,  cash  used in  financing
activities  was largely  attributable  to the pay down of  commercial  paper and
debt, and the repurchase of approximately $3 billion of AT&T common stock.

EBITDA  is a  measure  of our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow and  should  be
considered  in  addition  to, but not as a  substitute  for,  other  measures of
financial  performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  EBITDA  increased $333 million,  or 7.0%, to $5,060 million for the
third quarter of 1999 compared with the same period last year.  EBITDA increased
$4,834 million, or 54.2%, to $13,748 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1999,  compared with the same period in 1998.  Excluding  AB&IS,  AGNS,  the
restructuring  and other  charges,  and gains on sales of businesses in 1999 and
1998, EBITDA increased 25.1% to $13,723 million in the first nine months of 1999
from  $10,971  million  for the first  nine  months of 1998.  The  increase  was
primarily due to increased  revenues and improved  margins in business  services
and cost reductions in consumer services.



EURO CONVERSION
On January 1, 1999,  certain  members of the European  Union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the European  Union's
currency (Euro).  The transition period is anticipated to extend through July 1,
2002.  We have assessed the impact of the  conversion on  information-technology
systems,   currency   exchange  rate  risk,   derivatives  and  other  financial
instruments,  continuity  of  material  contracts  as  well  as  income  tax and
accounting  issues.  To date,  the  conversion  has not had nor do we expect the
conversion  during  the  transition  period  to have a  material  effect  on our
consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL  CONDITION Total assets  increased  $102,256  million,  or 171.7%,  to
$161,806  million at September 30, 1999,  compared  with December 31, 1998.  The
increase  in total  assets  was due  primarily  to the  impact of  AB&IS,  which
resulted in franchise costs, an investment in LMG,  increased other  investments
including  Cablevision,  Excite@Home and Lenfest  Communications,  Inc., and the
addition of over $6 billion to property,  plant and equipment.  In addition,  we
recognized  goodwill  related  to AGNS.  Other  assets  increased  $1.5  billion
representing  the  Comcast  break-up  fee  loaned  to  MediaOne  by AT&T.  These
increases  were  partially  offset by a net decrease in cash,  which was used to
partially  fund  capital  expenditures  during the period and the first  quarter
share repurchase, as well as AGNS.

Total liabilities  increased  $44,377 million,  or 130.8%, to $78,296 million at
September  30, 1999,  compared  with  December  31,  1998.  The increase was due
primarily  to AB&IS,  particularly  deferred  income  taxes  and debt,  the $8.5
billion in bond  offerings and the issuance of $6.3 billion of short-term  debt.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by the  retirement  of $2.1 billion of
long-term debt.

Included within  "Minority  Interest in Equity of Consolidated  Subsidiaries" is
Class  A  Senior  Cumulative   Exchangeable   Preferred  Stock  of  TCI  Pacific
Communications, Inc. (Pacific) and TCI Class B Preferred Stock. At September 30,
1999,  the amount of preferred  stock and  accumulated  dividends of Pacific and
Class B  preferred,  respectively,  were an  aggregate  $2.1  billion  and  $149
million.

In addition,  AT&T issued $5.0 million of quarterly convertible income preferred
securities (recorded net of a $0.3 million discount) to Microsoft.

Total  shareowners'  equity  increased  $49,241 million,  or 192.9%,  to $74,763
million at September 30, 1999, compared with December 31, 1998. The increase was
due primarily to the issuance of shares  related to AB&IS,  partially  offset by
shares repurchased.

AT&T Group's  ratio of total debt to total  capital at September  30, 1999,  was
42.6% compared with 20.9% at December 31, 1998.  Equity  includes the $5 billion
convertible  securities  issued to Microsoft  and debt  includes $1.6 billion of
non-convertible  securities issued by TCI's subsidiary  trusts. The increase was
primarily  driven by an increase in debt  associated with AB&IS and $8.5 billion
of bond  issuances  in 1999,  partially  offset by a higher  equity  base.  AT&T
Group's net debt-to-operational EBITDA was 1.69X at September 30, 1999, compared
with 0.24X at December 31, 1998.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We are exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign  exchange
rates.  On a limited  basis we use  certain  derivative  financial  instruments,
including interest rate swaps, options,  forwards and other derivative contracts
to manage  these  risks.  We do not use  financial  instruments  for  trading or
speculative  purposes.  All financial  instruments  are used in accordance  with
board-approved policies.

Assuming a 10%  downward  shift in interest  rates at September  30,  1999,  the
potential  loss for changes in fair value of unhedged  debt would have been $1.0
billion.

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities."  Among other
provisions, it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets
or  liabilities  in the  statement  of  financial  position  and  measure  those
instruments at fair value.  Gains and losses  resulting from changes in the fair
values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date of
this standard was delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective  date
for SFAS No. 133 is now for fiscal years beginning  after June 15, 2000,  though
earlier  adoption is encouraged and retroactive  application is prohibited.  For
AT&T this means that the standard must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001.
Management  does not expect the  adoption  of this  standard  to have a material
impact on AT&T's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

YEAR 2000
AT&T is  preparing  its systems and  applications  for the year 2000 (Y2K).  The
issue our Y2K program  addresses is the use of a two-digit year field instead of
a  four-digit  year  field in  computer  systems.  If  computer  systems  cannot
distinguish  between the year 1900 and the year 2000,  system  failures or other
computer  errors could  result.  The potential for failures and errors spans all
aspects of our business,  including  computer systems,  voice and data networks,
and   building   infrastructures.    We   are   also   faced   with   addressing
interdependencies  with our suppliers,  connecting carriers and major customers,
all of whom face the same issue.

AT&T's company-wide Y2K program is focused on four interrelated categories which
are   critical  to   maintaining   uninterrupted   service  to  our   customers:
AT&T-developed  applications  and  their  external  interfaces,  AT&T  networks,
information-technology (IT) platforms that support the applications,  and non-IT
infrastructure.

AT&T's  progress in our Y2K program is  measured  by certain key  milestones  or
phases common to each category of systems.  These  milestones  are:  assessment,
repair/remediation,  testing and  certification.  AT&T  monitors  and tracks the
progress  of our Y2K program  through a series of  scorecards  that  capture the
activities related to the Y2K process phases.

As  of  September  30,  1999,   AT&T's  network   services  and   AT&T-developed
applications and their external  interfaces are year 2000 compliant.  This means
they have been assessed for year 2000 impacts, repaired if necessary, tested and
fully  deployed.  Within  the  IT-infrastructure   category,  some  non-critical
desktops  remain  to be  certified  and a small  number  of sites  remain  to be
certified  in the  non-IT  infrastructure  category.  The  certification  of the
remaining  desktops and sites is expected to be completed in November  1999. The
status of AB&IS' Y2K program is  discussed  separately  from the  existing  AT&T
program.  All targets cited herein also exclude  information  regarding  pending
acquisitions,   whose  programs   continue  to  be  evaluated  and  planned  for
integration into the overall AT&T Y2K program.

Program Status
AT&T now has over 3,500  applications that (1) directly support AT&T's voice and
data  telecommunications  services  (including  wired  and  wireless);  (2)  are
critical  to  the   provisioning,   administration,   maintenance  and  customer
service/support related to our telecommunications  services; and (3) support our
sales  and   marketing   organizations,   other  AT&T   services   and  internal
administrative functions. These applications represent over 385 million lines of
code. As of September 30, 1999, these applications are 100% complaint.

With respect to external (third-party) interface assessment, formal letters were
sent to about 2,000  domestic  telecommunications  companies  and  international
telecommunications  authorities  to request  information  on their Y2K plans and
targets  for  compliance.  We have  identified  over  1,000  different  types of
third-party  interfaces and about 10,000 total  instances of those types.  As of
September 30, 1999,  AT&T is 100% complete  with Y2K  certification  of external
interfaces.

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

The AT&T network is critical to providing top-quality,  reliable service to AT&T
customers.  As of September 30, 1999, the assessment,  repair and  certification
phases  of the  operation-support  systems  (OS) were  100%  complete  and these
systems are now fully deployed.  In addition to the AT&T-developed  applications
supporting  the  network,   AT&T  has  inventoried   about  2,000  unique  types
(manufactured/model  combinations) of externally purchased network elements (NE)
including switches, routers,  network-control points and signal-transfer points.
Additional Y2K testing is conducted to  independently  verify supplier claims of
compliance.  All of the NEs are now  certified.  After  OS/NE  certification  is
complete,  AT&T performs  integration testing to verify Y2K certification of NEs
in conjunction with the associated OS applications.  Such integration testing is
100% completed, and all of the NEs are fully deployed.

The IT infrastructure  category addresses not only the computing  platforms that
are critical to the  AT&T-developed  applications,  but also the common modules,
communications  protocols,  the internal AT&T wide-area and local-area networks,
desktop  hardware/software  and the internal voice network.  As of September 30,
1999,  AT&T was 100%  compliant in computing  platforms,  about 95% compliant in
desktops,  100%  compliant in voice systems and adjuncts,  and 100% compliant in
data  networks.  The desktops that still remain to be validated as Y2K compliant
are not in  customer-affecting  areas. Based on the experience with the desktops
already verified as compliant,  it is likely that many of the remaining desktops
may only require software "patches" or minimal upgrades to be made compliant. We
anticipate  that we will complete the validation  process by the end of November
1999.

The non-IT  infrastructure  focuses on the  energy-  and  environment-management
systems  that are  critical  to  various  computer  systems,  as well as safety,
security and operations.  This aspect of the Y2K program  encompasses  more than
18,000 sites,  including  thousands of repeater huts,  radio towers and wireless
cell sites. As of September 30, 1999, 100% of all sites completed  inventory and
assessment  and about 97% are compliant (or not  impacted).  The small number of
sites that still  remain to be  certified as  compliant  are  anticipated  to be
completed by mid-November 1999.

In addition, AT&T has virtually completed network  interoperability tests with a
variety of domestic and international  testing partners,  with the remaining two
tests  scheduled  to be  completed  in  November.  These  tests are  designed to
exercise the network  across a range of our vendors,  and across a range of AT&T
voice, private line, and data services.  We have also completed testing with key
customer and industry segments,  including the financial  community,  insurance,
power  utilities,  the federal  government and others.  All test results to date
have been positive.

Similar to AT&T's Y2K program,  the AB&IS program has a four-phased  approach to
determining the readiness of systems for Y2K, namely:  assessment,  remediation,
testing and  implementation.  As of September 30, 1999,  critical cable delivery
systems and customer services are Y2K compliant. We anticipate completion of all
remaining phases of AB&IS' program by mid-November. AB&IS is also continuing its
efforts to verify  the year 2000  readiness  of its  significant  suppliers  and
vendors and  continue to  communicate  with  significant  business  partners and
affiliates to assess such partners' and affiliates' Y2K status.

Costs
We have  expended  approximately  $675  million  since  inception in 1997 on all
phases of the Y2K project.  This figure  included  approximately  $76 million of
costs  incurred  during the third  quarter of 1999, of which  approximately  $11
million represented  capital spending for upgrading and replacing  non-compliant
computer  systems  and  network  components.  Less than  half of the 1999  costs
incurred to date represent  internal IT resources that have been redeployed from
other projects and are expected to return to these  projects upon  completion of
the Y2K  project.  We  anticipate  remaining  Y2K costs for 1999,  inclusive  of
approximately $25 million projected expenditures  associated with completing the
AB&IS program,  will be  approximately  $64 million.  This  projection  includes
approximately  $21  million  of  capitalized  costs.  The  remaining   projected
expenditures  will consist primarily of continued  independent  verification and
validation;  contingency  planning  testing;  completion  of document  retention
requirements and continued communications expansion and enhancement.

Risk Assessment
We have  assessed our business  exposure that would result from a failure of our
Y2K program,  as well as those of our suppliers,  connecting  carriers and major
customers.  Such  failures  would  result in  business  consequences  that could
include failure to be able to serve  customers,  loss of network  functionality,
inability to render accurate bills, lost revenues, harm to the AT&T brand, legal
and regulatory exposure, and failure of management controls. Although we believe
that internal Y2K compliance will be achieved by December 31, 1999, there can be
no assurance that the Y2K problem will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Contingency Plans
AT&T's  contingency  planning program focuses on 38 critical business  processes
and many more that are designated as "important" or "support". The plans address
all    facets    of    business    continuity,    including    key    suppliers,
systems/applications,  IT infrastructure and work centers.  Specific examples of
AT&T's contingency plan initiatives include the following:

Plans are under way to engineer additional network capacity and to position AT&T
personnel  on site at  critical  locations  to  monitor  operations  and  manage
increases in work and call volumes.

Agreements  are being  negotiated  with  contractors  and  vendors to ensure the
availability of on-site technical support.  This coverage  includes,  but is not
limited to, network centers and sites, customer-care centers and data centers.

We are planning to proactively stage supplemental  power, fuel, water,  heating,
air-conditioning and ventilation sources to support critical business operations
and personnel requirements.

Alternate  procedures  and  processes  are being  developed to support  critical
customer functions,  including alternative procedures for rapid repair, recovery
and restoration of critical technology components by business resumption teams.

Procedures to perform database backups,  hardcopy printouts,  data retention and
recovery are being established for business critical data.

Risk Management
In  addition  to the  contingency  planning  program,  AT&T has  implemented  an
Independent Verification and Validation program for applications to validate the
quality  of  application  remediation  and  testing,  as well as the  continuing
compliance  of systems  put back into  production.  We also  continue to conduct
independent audits across critical areas of the Y2K program.

AT&T  continues  to monitor the progress of over 50  countries  who  represent a
significant  revenue  source.  Based on  assessments  aggregated  by the Network
Reliability  and  Interoperability  Council,  the outlook for Y2K  readiness for
these   countries   and   their   carriers   continues   to   improve.   Network
interoperability testing results also support this view.

To  maintain  a  state  of  readiness  and  further  protect  against  potential
Y2K-related  service  disruptions,  AT&T is instituting a special "quiet period"
from  December 1, 1999  through  January 15, 2000.  During this  period,  no new
software or hardware  will be  introduced  into the network or support  systems.
Provisioning and scheduled maintenance will also be limited.

OTHER  MATTERS On April 30, 1999,  AT&T  completed  its  acquisition  of the IBM
Global Network business (renamed AT&T Global Network Services or "AGNS") and its
assets in the United States.  The acquisition is occurring in phases  throughout
1999 as legal and regulatory requirements are met in each of the 59 countries in
which  the  business  operates.  As of  the  end of the  third  quarter,  we had
completed acquisitions representing  approximately 95% of the revenues generated
by businesses  which comprise AGNS. The  acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase.  Accordingly,  the operating results of AGNS have been included in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements since the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets of approximately $4.1 billion including customer lists and the
excess of the  purchase  price over the fair value of net  assets  acquired  are
being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over periods ranging from five to 30
years. The pro forma impact of AGNS on historical AT&T results are not material.

On May 28, 1999, At Home Corporation consummated a merger agreement with Excite,
Inc.  (Excite),  a global  Internet  media  company  that offers  consumers  and
advertisers   comprehensive   Internet   navigation   services  with   extensive
personalization  capabilities.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, At Home
Corporation issued  approximately 116 million shares of its common stock for all
of the outstanding common stock of Excite. As a result, AT&T's economic interest
in At Home  Corporation  (Excite@Home)  decreased  from 38% to 26% following the
merger. Due to the resulting increase in Excite@Home's  equity after the merger,
net of the dilution of AT&T's ownership  interest in Excite@Home,  AT&T recorded
an increase to additional paid-in capital of $488 million at September 30, 1999.
In the fourth quarter of 1999,  Excite@Home agreed to acquire an online greeting
card  company.  Upon  completion  of that  merger,  AT&T will record  additional
amounts  to its  additional  paid-in  capital as the share of its  ownership  of
Excite@Home is diluted. At September 30, 1999, AT&T owned 94.5 million shares of
Excite@Home  common stock and has an approximate  58% voting interest on certain
matters.

On August 2, 1999, AT&T completed its acquisition of Honolulu Cellular Telephone
Company from BellSouth.

In August 1999, AT&T and British  Telecommunications plc (BT) jointly acquired a
33.3% stake in Rogers  Cantel  Mobile  Communications  Inc.  (Rogers  Cantel) in
Canada for  approximately  $934 million in cash. The investment is owned equally
by AT&T and BT. Rogers Cantel is Canada's  largest  mobile  company  serving two
million  customers from coast to coast.  Rogers Cantel provides a complete range
of wireless  solutions  including  cellular,  paging and interactive  messaging,
digital PCS and wireless data services  marketed under the co-brand Cantel AT&T.
Also in August 1999, AT&T sold 30% of its 31% ownership  interest in AT&T Canada
to BT for approximately $402 million resulting in a $110 million pretax gain and
a 22% beneficial ownership by AT&T. AT&T and BT both contributed their ownership
interest  of AT&T  Canada to a joint  venture  that is 70% owned by AT&T and 30%
owned by BT.

On  September  2, 1999,  AT&T and BT  acquired a 30% stake in Japan  Telecom for
$1.83 billion.

The  previously  announced  global  venture  between  AT&T  and BT has  received
approval  from the Federal  Communication  Commission  (FCC),  the U.S.  Justice
Department  and the  European  Commission.  The  venture,  which  will be called
Concert, will combine transborder assets and operations of each company and will
be  equally  owned by both  companies  when  operations  begin.  The  venture is
expected to be completed in the fourth  quarter of 1999 and to begin  operations
on January 1, 2000.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On  October  6,  1999,  AT&T  and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation  (Dobson)
announced  the signing of a definitive  agreement to acquire  American  Cellular
Corporation through a newly created joint venture for $2.32 billion. Dobson will
be responsible  for day to day  management of the joint  venture,  which will be
equally owned and jointly controlled by Dobson and AT&T. The acquisition will be
funded  with  non-recourse  bank  debt by the  joint  venture  and  cash  equity
contributions of up to $370 million from each of the two partners.  The Board of
Directors of AT&T,  Dobson and American  Cellular have approved the transaction.
The  acquisition,  which is expected to close in the first  quarter of 2000,  is
subject to  approval  by  American  Cellular's  shareowners,  as well as federal
regulatory and certain other conditions.

On October 21, 1999,  shareowners of MediaOne Group, Inc. (MediaOne) unanimously
voted in favor of the proposed  merger between AT&T and MediaOne,  pursuant to a
definitive  merger agreement entered into on May 6, 1999. In accordance with the
agreement, AT&T will purchase each share of MediaOne common stock for $85.00 per
share consisting of 0.95 of a share of AT&T common stock plus $30.85 in cash. In
addition,  the agreement provides for an increase in the amount of cash received
per share of MediaOne  common  stock to the extent  that AT&T's  stock price was
less than $57.00 per share. The additional  amount of cash which may be received
is limited to $5.42 per share.  AT&T plans to issue  approximately  613  million
shares in the transaction.  Upon receipt of regulatory and other approvals,  the
merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2000.

On November 1, 1999, AT&T announced its plans to form a new public  company,  to
be named AT&T Latin America,  that will merge the  operations of Netstream,  the
competitive local exchange company AT&T is acquiring in Brazil, and FirstCom,  a
publicly traded company with competitive telecommunications operations in Chile,
Columbia and Peru. AT&T, together with Promon Tecnologia, its Brazilian partner,
will contribute  Netstream and $70 million in cash. AT&T will own  approximately
60% of the  company,  owning  Class B  shares,  with 10  votes  per  share.  The
transaction has been approved by both AT&T's and FirstCom's  Board of Directors.
Upon approval by FirstCom shareowners as well as regulatory and other approvals,
the  transaction  is expected to close in the first quarter of 2000.  AT&T Latin
America intends to apply for listing on the NASDAQ stock market.

On November 5, 1999,  WORLDxCHANGE  Communications  announced the acquisition of
ACC in Europe (ACC) from AT&T. The agreement includes ACC's principal operations
in the United Kingdom, as well as ACC's operating  companies in France,  Germany
and  Italy.  AT&T  believes  it will  record a pretax  loss in the range of $150
million to $200 million on the sale.

LEGISLATIVE  AND  REGULATORY  DEVELOPMENTS  On  October  8,  1999,  the  Federal
Communications  Commission  (FCC) adopted  amendments  to its cable  attribution
rules which eased restrictions on its horizontal ownership limitations.  In 1993
the FCC had adopted  rules which  limited the number of  households  passed by a
single cable operator to 30% of households  passed by all cable  operators.  The
amendments  affirmed the 30% limit but changed the applicable  measurement  from
households  passed to  subscribers.  In  addition,  the FCC expanded the base of
total  subscribers  to include those served by  alternative  multichannel  video
programming  distributors,  such as direct broadcast  satellite.  The FCC stated
that the 30% limit on total subscribers  equated to 36.7% of cable  subscribers.
In  addition,  the  FCC  also  exempted  from a  cable  operator's  attributable
subscribers  those served by systems that the cable  operator  overbuilds  in an
incumbent cable franchise territory after October 20, 1999. The FCC retained the
5% voting equity threshold for attribution, and adopted a rule which would treat
as  attributable  any interest that exceeds 33% of the total asset value (equity
plus debt) of the entity.  The FCC stayed enforcement of the new rules until the
D.C.  Circuit Court of Appeals  decides upon the pending  challenge to the cable
attribution rules.

         (a combination of certain assets, as defined in notes 1 and 2)

                     Notes to Combined Financial Statements

                               September 30, 1999
                                   (unaudited)

(1)      Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying  combined financial statements include the accounts of
         the subsidiaries and assets of  Tele-Communications,  Inc. ("TCI") that
         are attributed to Liberty Media Group,  as defined  below.  On March 9,
         1999,  AT&T acquired TCI in a merger  transaction  (the "AT&T Merger").
         See note 2. The AT&T Merger has been  accounted  for using the purchase
         method. Accordingly,  Liberty Media Group's assets and liabilities have
         been recorded at their respective fair market values therefore creating
         a new cost basis. For financial  reporting purposes the AT&T Merger and
         related  restructuring  transactions  described in note 2 are deemed to
         have occurred on March 1, 1999. Accordingly, for periods prior to March
         1, 1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed  to Liberty Media Group
         and the related combined financial statements are sometimes referred to
         herein as "Old  Liberty",  and for periods  subsequent  to February 28,
         1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and
         the related  combined  financial  statements are sometimes  referred to
         herein as "New Liberty".  The "Company" and "Liberty Media Group" refer
         to both New Liberty and Old Liberty.

         The following table represents the summary balance sheet of Old Liberty
         at February 28, 1999 prior to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of the AT&T Merger and the opening  summary balance sheet
         of New Liberty  subsequent to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of  the  AT&T  Merger.  Certain  pre-merger  transactions
         occurring  between  March 1, 1999 and March 9, 1999 that  affected  Old
         Liberty's equity, gains on issuance of equity by subsidiaries and stock
         compensation have been reflected in the two-month period ended February
         28, 1999.

         The following  unaudited  condensed  results of operations for the nine
         months ended  September  30, 1999 and 1998 were  prepared  assuming the
         AT&T Merger  occurred on January 1, 1998.  These pro forma  amounts are
         not  necessarily  indicative  of  operating  results  that  would  have
         occurred if the AT&T Merger had occurred on January 1, 1998.

         At September 30, 1999, Liberty Media Group consisted principally of the
         following:  (i) AT&T's assets and businesses which provide  programming
         services including production, acquisition and distribution through all
         available formats and media of branded  entertainment,  educational and
         informational programming and software,  including multimedia products,
         (ii) AT&T's  assets and  businesses  engaged in  electronic  retailing,
         direct marketing,  advertising sales relating to programming  services,
         infomercials and transaction processing, (iii) certain of AT&T's assets
         and  businesses   engaged  in   international   cable,   telephony  and
         programming  businesses  and (iv)  AT&T's  holdings  in a new  class of
         tracking stock of Sprint (the "Sprint PCS Group Stock").

         All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
         eliminated.  The combined  financial  statements of Liberty Media Group
         are presented for purposes of additional  analysis of the  consolidated
         financial  statements  of AT&T and should be read in  conjunction  with
         such consolidated financial statements.

         The accompanying  interim combined  financial  statements are unaudited
         but, in the opinion of management,  reflect all adjustments (consisting
         of normal recurring  accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the
         results for such  periods.  The results of  operations  for any interim
         period are not  necessarily  indicative  of results  for the full year.
         These combined financial  statements should be read in conjunction with
         the combined financial statements and notes thereto contained in AT&T's
         Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 22, 1999.

                                   (continued)

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements  and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         Effective June 11, 1999, AT&T issued stock dividends to holders of AT&T
         Liberty Media Group Tracking Stock (the "1999 Liberty Stock Dividend").
         The 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend  consisted of one share of AT&T Liberty
         Media Group  Tracking  Stock for every one share of AT&T Liberty  Media
         Group  Tracking  Stock owned.  The 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend has been
         treated  as a stock  split,  and  accordingly,  all share and per share
         amounts have been restated to reflect the 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend.

         Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified for  comparability
         with the 1999 presentation.

(2)      Merger with AT&T

         As a  result  of the AT&T  Merger,  holders  of  shares  of TCI's  then
         outstanding  Liberty Media Group  Tracking Stock and TCI Ventures Group
         Tracking  Stock were issued  separate  shares of new targeted  stock of
         AT&T. Each share of TCI's then outstanding Liberty Media Group Series A
         Tracking  Stock was converted into 2 shares of a newly created class of
         AT&T common stock, the AT&T Liberty Media Group Class A Tracking Stock,
         each share of TCI's  then  outstanding  Liberty  Media  Group  Series B
         Tracking  Stock was converted into 2 shares of a newly created class of
         AT&T common stock, the AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock,
         each  share of TCI's  then  outstanding  TCI  Ventures  Group  Series A
         Tracking  Stock was  converted  into 1.04 shares of AT&T Liberty  Media
         Group Class A Tracking  Stock and each share of TCI's then  outstanding
         TCI Ventures  Group  Series B Tracking  Stock was  converted  into 1.04
         shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock.

         Effective  with  the AT&T  Merger,  each  share  of  TCI's  Convertible
         Preferred  Stock Series  C-Liberty Media Group was converted into 112.5
         shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media  Group  Class A Tracking  Stock and each
         share of TCI's  Redeemable  Convertible  Liberty Media Group  Preferred
         Stock, Series H was converted into 1.18125 shares of AT&T Liberty Media
         Group Class A Tracking Stock. In general, the holders of shares of AT&T
         Liberty Media Group Class A Tracking Stock and the holders of shares of
         AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock will vote together as a
         single  class with the  holders of shares of AT&T  Common  Stock on all
         matters presented to such stockholders, with the holders being entitled
         to  three-fortieths  (3/40th) of a vote for each share of AT&T  Liberty
         Media Group Class A Tracking Stock held, three-fourths (3/4th) vote per
         share of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  Class B Tracking  Stock held and 1
         vote per share of AT&T Common Stock held.

         The shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  Tracking  Stock issued in the
         AT&T Merger are  intended to reflect the  separate  performance  of the
         businesses  and assets  attributed to Liberty Media Group.  Immediately
         prior to the AT&T Merger,  certain assets previously  attributed to Old
         Liberty  (including,  among  others,  the shares of AT&T  Common  Stock
         received in the merger of AT&T and Teleport  Communications Group, Inc.
         ("Teleport")  (see  note  7),  Old  Liberty's   interests  in  At  Home
         Corporation  ("@Home"),  the National Digital Television  Center,  Inc.
         ("NDTC") and Western Tele-Communications, Inc.) were attributed to "TCI
         Group" (a group of TCI's assets,  which,  prior to the AT&T Merger, was
         comprised   primarily  of  TCI's  domestic  cable  and   communications
         business)  in  exchange  for  approximately  $5.5  billion in cash (the
         "Asset Transfers"). Also, upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, through
         a new tax sharing  agreement  between the Company and AT&T, the Company
         is entitled to the benefit of approximately $2 billion in net operating
         loss  carryforwards   available  to  the  entities  included  in  TCI's
         consolidated  income tax return as of the date of the AT&T Merger. Such
         net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are subject to  adjustment  by the
         Internal  Revenue  Service  ("IRS") and are subject to  limitations  on
         usage  which may affect the  ultimate  amount  utilized.  Additionally,
         certain warrants to purchase shares of General Instruments  Corporation
         ("GI Warrants")  previously  attributed to TCI Group were attributed to
         the Company in exchange for approximately $176 million in cash. Certain
         agreements  entered into at the time of the AT&T Merger provide,  among
         other things,  for  preferred  vendor status to the Company for digital
         basic  distribution  on  AT&T's  systems  of new  programming  services
         created  by the  Company  and for a  renewal  of  existing  affiliation
         agreements.  Pursuant to amended corporate governance documents for the
         entities  included in Liberty Media Group and certain  agreements among
         AT&T and TCI, the business of Liberty  Media Group will  continue to be
         managed by certain persons who were members of TCI's  management  prior
         to the AT&T Merger.

         Pursuant to a proposed final judgment (the "Final  Judgment") agreed to
         by TCI, AT&T and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") on
         December  31,  1998,   Liberty  Media  Group  transferred  all  of  its
         beneficially owned securities (the "Sprint  Securities") of Sprint to a
         trustee (the "Trustee")  prior to the AT&T Merger.  The Final Judgment,
         if entered by the United  States  District  Court for the  District  of
         Columbia,  would  require the Trustee,  on or before May 23,  2002,  to
         dispose  of a portion  of the  Sprint  Securities  sufficient  to cause
         Liberty  Media  Group  to  beneficially  own no  more  than  10% of the
         outstanding  Series 1 PCS Stock of Sprint on a fully  diluted  basis on
         such date.  On or before May 23,  2004,  the  Trustee  must  divest the
         remainder of the Sprint Securities  beneficially owned by Liberty Media
         Group.

         The Final  Judgment  would  provide  that the  Trustee  vote the Sprint
         Securities  beneficially  owned  by  Liberty  Media  Group  in the same
         proportion  as other  holders  of  Sprint's  PCS  Stock so long as such
         securities  are  held by the  trust.  The  Final  Judgment  would  also
         prohibit the  acquisition  by Liberty Media Group of additional  Sprint
         Securities, with certain exceptions,  without the prior written consent
         of the DOJ.

(3)      Loss Per Common Share

         Basic  earnings or loss per share  ("EPS") is measured as the income or
         loss  attributable  to  common  stockholders  divided  by the  weighted
         average  outstanding  common  shares  for the  period.  Diluted  EPS is
         similar to basic EPS but presents  the  dilutive  effect on a per share
         basis of potential  common shares as if they had been  converted at the
         beginning of the periods  presented.  Potential common shares that have
         an anti-dilutive effect are excluded from diluted EPS.

         The basic and diluted loss  attributable  to Liberty Media Group common
         stockholders  per  common  share for the three and seven  months  ended
         September  30, 1999 was computed by dividing the net loss  attributable
         to Liberty  Media Group common  stockholders  by the  weighted  average
         number  of  common  shares  outstanding  of AT&T  Liberty  Media  Group
         Tracking  Stock during each period.  Potential  common  shares were not
         included in the  computations  of weighted  average shares  outstanding
         because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

         At September 30, 1999,  there were 52 million  potential  common shares
         consisting of fixed and nonvested performance awards, stock options and
         convertible   securities  that  could  potentially  dilute  future  EPS
         calculations  in periods of net  earnings.  No material  changes in the
         weighted average outstanding shares or potential common shares occurred
         after September 30, 1999.

         Cash paid for interest was $75 million for the seven month period ended
         September 30, 1999, $32 million for the two month period ended February
         28, 1999 and $79 million for the nine months ended  September 30, 1998.
         Cash paid for income taxes for the seven month  period ended  September

         USAI owns and operates businesses in network and television production,
         television  broadcasting,  electronic retailing,  ticketing operations,
         and internet  services.  At September  30,  1999,  Liberty  Media Group
         directly  and  indirectly  held 33.3  million  shares of USAI's  common
         stock.  Liberty  Media  Group  also held  shares  directly  in  certain
         subsidiaries of USAI which are exchangeable into 39.5 million shares of
         USAI common stock.  Liberty Media Group's  direct  ownership of USAI is
         currently  restricted by FCC regulations.  The exchange of these shares
         can be accomplished  only if there is a change to existing  regulations
         or if Liberty  Media  Group  obtains  permission  from the FCC.  If the
         exchange of Liberty Media Group's shares of such  subsidiary  stock, as
         well as certain securities owned by Universal Studios, Inc. and certain
         of its  affiliates,  into USAI common stock were completed at September
         30,  1999,  Liberty  Media  Group  would  own 72.8  million  shares  or
         approximately  21% of the then  outstanding  USAI common stock.  USAI's
         common  stock  had a  closing  market  price of  $38-3/4  per  share on
         September 30, 1999. Liberty Media Group accounts for its investments in
         USAI and  related  subsidiaries  on a combined  basis  under the equity
         method.

         In  February  1998,  USAI paid  cash and issued  shares  and one of its
         subsidiaries  issued  shares  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of
         certain   assets  from   Universal   Studios,   Inc.  (the   "Universal
         Transaction").   Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  an  increase  to  its
         investment in USAI of $54 million and an increase to combined equity of
         $33 million (after deducting a deferred income taxes of $21 million) as
         a result of this share issuance. No gain was recognized in the combined
         statement of operations  and  comprehensive  earnings for the Universal
         Transaction  due primarily to Liberty  Media Group's  intention at such
         time to purchase  additional  equity  interests in USAI.  In connection
         with the  Universal  Transaction,  Liberty  Media  Group was granted an
         antidilutive  right with respect to any future  issuance of USAI common
         stock, subject to certain limitations,  that enables it to maintain its
         percentage ownership interests in USAI.

         Effective September 1, 1998, Telewest and General Cable PLC consummated
         a  merger.  In  connection  with  the  merger,  Liberty  Media  Group's
         ownership interest in Telewest decreased to 22%. In connection with the
         increase in  Telewest's  equity,  net of the dilution of Liberty  Media
         Group's  interest in Telewest,  that resulted from the merger,  Liberty
         Media Group recorded a non-cash gain of $58 million  (before  deducting
         deferred income tax expense of $20 million) during the third quarter of
         1998.

         Telewest   currently  operates  and  constructs  cable  television  and
         telephone  systems in the UK. At September 30, 1999 Liberty Media Group
         indirectly  owned 463  million of the issued and  outstanding  Telewest
         ordinary  shares.  The  reported  closing  price  on the  London  Stock
         Exchange of Telewest ordinary shares was (pound)2.23  ($3.67) per share
         at September 30, 1999.

         Liberty Media Group and The News  Corporation  Limited  ("News  Corp.")
         each held 50% of Fox Sports which operates national and regional sports
         networks.  Prior to the first quarter of 1998,  Liberty Media Group had
         no obligation,  nor intention, to fund Fox Sports. During 1998, Liberty
         Media  Group made the  determination  to provide  funding to Fox Sports
         based on specific transactions consummated by Fox Sports. Consequently,
         Liberty Media Group's share of losses of Fox Sports for the nine months
         ended September 30, 1998 included previously unrecognized losses of Fox
         Sports of  approximately  $64  million.  Losses for Fox Sports were not
         recognized  in prior periods due to the fact that Liberty Media Group's
         investment in Fox Sports was less than zero.

         On July 15, 1999 News Corp. acquired Liberty Media Group's 50% interest
         in Fox  Sports  in  exchange  for  51.8  million  News  Corp.  American
         Depository  Receipts  ("ADRs")  representing  preferred  limited voting
         ordinary  shares of News Corp. Of the 51.8 million ADRs  received,  3.6
         million  were  placed in an escrow  (the  "Escrow  Shares")  pending an
         independent  third party valuation,  as of the third anniversary of the
         transaction.  The  remainder  of the 51.8 million  ADRs  received  (the
         "Restricted  Shares") are subject to a two-year  lockup which restricts
         any transfer of the  securities for a period of two years from the date
         of the  transaction.  Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  the ADRs at fair
         value,  which  included a discount from market value for the Restricted
         Shares due to the two-year restriction on transfer,  resulting in a $13
         million  gain on the  transaction.  In a related  transaction,  Liberty
         Media Group  acquired  from News Corp.  28.1  million  additional  ADRs
         representing preferred limited voting ordinary shares of News Corp. for
         approximately  $695  million.  Liberty  Media  Group  accounts  for its
         investment in News Corp. as an  available-for-sale  security,  with the
         exception of the Restricted Shares and the Escrow Shares.

         The class A common stock of TV Guide is publicly  traded.  At September
         30, 1999,  Liberty Media Group held 29 million shares of TV Guide Class
         A common stock and 37 million  shares of TV Guide Class B common stock.
         See  note  7.  The TV  Guide  Class  B  common  stock  is  convertible,
         one-for-one,  into TV Guide Class A common stock. The closing price for
         TV Guide Class A common  stock was $39-1/8 per share on  September  30,
         1999.

         Flextech develops and sells a variety of television  programming in the
         UK. At September  30, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  indirectly  owned 58
         million  Flextech  ordinary  shares.  The reported closing price on the
         London Stock Exchange of the Flextech  ordinary  shares was (pound)9.45
         ($15.56) per share at September 30, 1999.

         The PCS Ventures  included Sprint Spectrum Holding  Company,  L. P. and
         MinorCo, L.P. (collectively, "Sprint PCS") and PhillieCo Partnership I,
         L.P. ("PhillieCo"). The partners of each of the Sprint PCS partnerships
         were  subsidiaries  of Sprint,  Comcast  Corporation  ("Comcast"),  Cox
         Communications,  Inc.  ("Cox") and Liberty Media Group. The partners of
         PhillieCo  were  subsidiaries  of Sprint,  Cox and Liberty Media Group.
         Liberty  Media  Group  had a 30%  partnership  interest  in each of the
         Sprint PCS partnerships and a 35% partnership interest in PhillieCo.

         On November 23, 1998, Liberty Media Group,  Comcast,  and Cox exchanged
         their  respective  interests  in  Sprint  PCS and  PhillieCo  (the "PCS
         Exchange")  for  shares of Sprint  PCS Group  Stock  which  tracks  the
         performance of Sprint's newly created PCS Group  (consisting  initially
         of the PCS  Ventures  and certain PCS  licenses  which were  separately
         owned by Sprint). The Sprint PCS Group Stock collectively represents an
         approximate  17%  voting  interest  in  Sprint.  As a result of the PCS
         Exchange,  Liberty  Media  Group  holds  the  Sprint  Securities  which
         consists  of shares  of Sprint  PCS  Group  Stock,  as well as  certain
         additional  securities of Sprint  exercisable  for or convertible  into
         such securities,  representing approximately 24% of the equity value of
         Sprint  attributable  to its PCS Group  and less than 1% of the  voting
         interest in Sprint.  Through  November  23, 1998,  Liberty  Media Group
         accounted for its interest in the PCS Ventures  using the equity method
         of  accounting,  however,  as a result of the PCS  Exchange and Liberty
         Media  Group's less than 1% voting  interest in Sprint,  Liberty  Media
         Group no longer  exercises  significant  influence  with respect to its
         investment  in the  PCS  Ventures.  Accordingly,  Liberty  Media  Group
         accounts  for its  investment  in the  Sprint  PCS  Group  Stock  as an
         available-for-sale security.

         In  September  1999,  Liberty  entered  into a four and  one-half  year
         "cashless  collar"  with a financial  institution  with respect to 17.5
         million  shares  of Sprint  PCS Group  common  stock,  secured  by 17.5
         million shares of such stock.  This cashless  collar  provides  Liberty
         Media  Group with a put option  that gives it the right to require  its
         counterparty  to buy 17.5 million  Sprint PCS Group shares from Liberty
         Media Group in  approximately  four and  one-half  years for a weighted
         average price of $55.24 per share.  Liberty Media Group  simultaneously
         sold a call option  giving the  counterparty  the right to buy the same
         number  of  Sprint  PCS  Group  shares  from  Liberty  Media  Group  in
         approximately  four and one-half years for a weighted  average price of
         $114.84 per share.

         The $14 billion  aggregate  excess of Liberty Media  Group's  aggregate
         carrying   amount  in  its   affiliates   over  Liberty  Media  Group's
         proportionate  share of its  affiliates'  net assets is being amortized
         over an estimated useful life of 20 years.

         Certain of Liberty Media Group's  affiliates  are general  partnerships
         and  subsidiaries  of Liberty Media Group that are general  partners in
         such  partnerships,  are liable as a matter of partnership  law for all
         debts (other than non-recourse  debts) of that partnership in the event
         liabilities of that partnership were to exceed its assets.

(6)      Investment in Time Warner

         Liberty  Media Group holds shares of a series of Time  Warner's  series
         common stock with limited voting rights (the "TW Exchange  Stock") that
         are convertible  into an aggregate of 114 million shares of Time Warner
         common stock.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         On June 24, 1997  Liberty  Media Group  granted  Time Warner an option,
         expiring  October  10,  2002,  to  acquire  the  business  of  Southern
         Satellite  Systems,  Inc.  ("Southern") and certain of its subsidiaries
         (together with Southern, the "Southern Business") through a purchase of
         assets (the "Southern Option").  Liberty Media Group received shares of
         TW Exchange  Stock which are  convertible  into 12.8 million  shares of
         Time Warner  common stock valued at $306 million in  consideration  for
         the grant.  In  September  1997,  Time Warner  exercised  the  Southern
         Option.  Pursuant to the  Southern  Option,  Time Warner  acquired  the
         Southern Business, effective January 1, 1998, for $213 million in cash.
         Liberty  Media  Group   recognized  a  $515  million  pre-tax  gain  in
         connection with such transactions in the first quarter of 1998.

         In March 1999, Liberty Media Group entered into a seven-year  "cashless
         collar" with a financial  institution with respect to 15 million shares
         of Time Warner  common  stock,  secured by 15 million  shares of its TW
         Exchange Stock.  This cashless collar provides Liberty Media Group with
         a put option that gives it the right to require its counterparty to buy
         15 million Time Warner shares from Liberty Media Group in approximately
         seven years for $67.45 per share.  Liberty  Media Group  simultaneously
         sold a call option  giving the  counterparty  the right to buy the same
         number of Time Warner shares from Liberty Media Group in  approximately
         seven years for $158.33 per share.

         As these  cashless  collars are  designated to 15 million  shares of TW
         Exchange Stock and 17.5 million shares of Sprint PCS Group common stock
         (together the "Underlying  Securities") held by Liberty Media Group and
         the changes in the fair value of the  cashless  collars are  correlated
         with  changes  in the fair  value  of the  Underlying  Securities,  the
         cashless collars function as hedges.  Accordingly,  changes in the fair
         value  of  the  cashless   collars  are  reported  as  a  component  of
         comprehensive  earnings (in unrealized gains) along with the changes in
         the fair value of the Underlying Securities.

(7)      Acquisitions and Dispositions

         Effective  February  1, 1998,  Turner-Vision,  Inc.  ("Turner  Vision")
         contributed the assets, obligations and operations of its retail C-band
         satellite business to  Superstar/Netlink  Group LLC ("SNG") in exchange
         for  an  approximate   20%  interest  in  SNG.  As  a  result  of  such
         transaction,  Liberty Media Group's direct and indirect (through United
         Video  Satellite  Group,  Inc.  ("UVSG"))  ownership  interest  in SNG,
         decreased  to  approximately  80%. In  connection  with the increase in
         SNG's equity,  net of the dilution of Liberty  Media Group's  ownership
         interest in SNG,  that resulted  from such  transaction,  Liberty Media
         Group  recognized  a gain of $38  million  (before  deducting  deferred
         income tax expense of $15 million). Turner Vision's contribution to SNG
         was  accounted  for as a  purchase  and the $61  million  excess of the
         purchase  price  over the fair  value of the net  assets  acquired  was
         recorded as excess cost and is being amortized over five years.

         On April 22, 1998,  Teleport  completed a merger  transaction  with ACC
         Corp.  As a result,  Liberty  Media  Group's  interest in Teleport  was
         reduced to  approximately  26%.  In  connection  with the  increase  in
         Teleport's  equity,  net of  the  dilution  of  Liberty  Media  Group's
         interest in Teleport,  that  resulted  from the merger,  Liberty  Media
         Group  recorded  a  non-cash  gain of $201  million  (before  deducting
         deferred income tax expense of $71 million).

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         On July 24, 1998, Teleport was acquired by AT&T and Liberty Media Group
         received in exchange for all of its interest in Teleport, approximately
         70.4  million  shares  of  AT&T  common  stock.   Liberty  Media  Group
         recognized a $2.3 billion gain  (excluding  related tax expense of $883
         million) on such transaction  during the third quarter of 1998 based on
         the  difference  between the carrying  value of Liberty  Media  Group's
         interest  in  Teleport  and the fair  value of the  AT&T  common  stock
         received.

         During  the  third  quarter  of  1998,  At Home  Corporation  ("@Home")
         completed a public  offering  in which  Liberty  Media Group  purchased
         additional  shares of @Home  common  stock and  Liberty  Media  Group's
         economic   interest  in  @Home  decreased  to  approximately   39%.  In
         connection with the increase in @Home's equity,  net of the dilution of
         Liberty  Media  Group's  interest in @Home that  resulted  from @Home's
         public  offering,  Liberty  Media Group  recorded a gain of $17 million
         during the third quarter of 1998.

         On March 1, 1999, UVSG and News Corp.  completed a transaction  whereby
         UVSG  acquired  News  Corp.'s  TV Guide  properties  creating a broader
         platform  for  offering  television  guide  services to  consumers  and
         advertisers  and UVSG was renamed TV Guide.  News Corp.  received total
         consideration  of $1.9 billion  including  $800  million in cash,  22.5
         million  shares of UVSG's Class A common stock and 37.5 million  shares
         of UVSG's  Class B common  stock  valued at an  average  of $18.65  per
         share.  In addition,  News Corp.  purchased  approximately  6.5 million
         additional  shares of UVSG  Class A common  stock for $129  million  in
         order to equalize its ownership with that of Liberty Media Group.  As a
         result of these transactions,  and another transaction completed on the
         same date,  News  Corp.,  Liberty  Media  Group and TV  Guide's  public
         stockholders own on an economic basis  approximately  44%, 44% and 12%,
         respectively, of TV Guide. Following such transactions,  News Corp. and
         Liberty Media Group each have  approximately 49% of the voting power of
         TV Guide's  outstanding  stock.  In connection  with the increase in TV
         Guide's equity,  net of the dilution of Liberty Media Group's ownership
         interest in TV Guide,  Liberty  Media Group  recognized  a gain of $372
         million (before deducting deferred income tax expense of $147 million).
         Upon  consummation,  Liberty  Media  Group  began  accounting  for  its
         interest in TV Guide under the equity method of accounting.

</TABLE>
         On April 8, 1999,  Liberty Media Group redeemed all of its  outstanding
         4-1/2% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due February 15, 2005. See
         note 10.

         On July 7, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  received  net cash  proceeds of
         approximately $741 million and $494 million from the issuance of 7-7/8%
         Senior Notes due 2009 (the "Senior Notes") and 8-1/2% Senior Debentures
         due 2029 (the "Senior Debentures"), respectively. The Senior Notes have
         an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and the Senior Debentures
         have an aggregate  principal  amount of $500  million.  Interest on the
         Senior  Notes and the  Senior  Debentures  is payable on January 15 and
         July 15 of each  year.  The  proceeds  were  used to repay  outstanding
         borrowings  under certain of Liberty Media Group's  credit  facilities,
         which were subsequently canceled.

         At  September  30, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group had  approximately  $133
         million in unused lines of credit under its bank credit facilities.

         The bank credit  facilities  of Liberty Media Group  generally  contain
         restrictive   covenants   which  require,   among  other  things,   the
         maintenance of certain  financial  ratios,  and include  limitations on
         indebtedness,  liens  and  encumbrances,   acquisitions,  dispositions,
         guarantees and dividends.  Additionally,  Liberty Media Group pays fees
         ranging from .15% to .375% per annum on the average unborrowed portions
         of the total  amounts  available for  borrowings  under its bank credit
         facilities.

         With the exception of the Senior Notes and the Senior  Debentures which
         had fair values of $754  million  and $504  million,  respectively,  at
         September  30, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  believes  that the carrying
         value of Liberty  Media  Group's  debt  approximated  its fair value at
         September 30, 1999.

                                   (continued)

(9)      Income Taxes

         Subsequent  to the AT&T Merger,  Liberty Media Group is included in the
         consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  of AT&T and  party to a tax
         sharing agreement with AT&T (the "AT&T Tax Sharing Agreement"). Liberty
         Media Group  calculates  its  respective  tax  liability  on a separate
         return  basis.  The income tax  provision  for  Liberty  Media Group is
         calculated  based on the  increase or decrease in the tax  liability of
         the AT&T consolidated group resulting from the inclusion of those items
         in the  consolidated  tax  return  of AT&T  which are  attributable  to
         Liberty Media Group.

         Under the AT&T Tax Sharing Agreement,  Liberty Media Group will receive
         a cash payment from AT&T in periods  when it generates  taxable  losses
         and such taxable losses are utilized by AT&T to reduce the consolidated
         income  tax  liability.  This  utilization  of taxable  losses  will be
         accounted for by Liberty Media Group as a current federal  intercompany
         income tax benefit. To the extent such losses are not utilized by AT&T,
         such  amounts  will be  available  to  reduce  federal  taxable  income
         generated by Liberty  Media Group in future  periods,  similar to a net
         operating  loss  carryforward  and will be accounted  for as a deferred
         federal income tax benefit.

         In periods when Liberty Media Group  generates  federal taxable income,
         AT&T has agreed to satisfy such tax  liability on Liberty Media Group's
         behalf up to a certain  amount.  The  reduction  of such  computed  tax
         liabilities will be accounted for by Liberty Media Group as a credit to
         combined equity.  The total amount of future federal tax liabilities of
         Liberty  Media Group which AT&T will satisfy under the AT&T Tax Sharing
         Agreement is  approximately  $512  million,  which  represents  the tax
         effect of the net operating loss carryforward  reflected in TCI's final
         federal  income tax  return,  subject to IRS  adjustments.  Thereafter,
         Liberty  Media  Group is  required  to make cash  payments  to AT&T for
         federal tax liabilities of Liberty Media Group.

         To the extent AT&T utilizes  existing net operating  losses of entities
         attributed to Liberty  Media Group,  such amounts will be accounted for
         by Liberty  Media Group as a reduction of combined  equity.  During the
         seven month  period  ending  September  30,  1999,  AT&T  utilized  net
         operating  losses of Liberty  Media Group with a tax effected  carrying
         value of $85 million.

         Liberty Media Group will  generally  make cash payments to AT&T related
         to states where it generates  taxable  income and receive cash payments
         from AT&T in states where it generates taxable losses.

         Liberty  Media  Group's  obligation  under  the  1995  TCI Tax  Sharing
         Agreement of approximately $139 million (subject to adjustment),  which
         is included in "due to related  parties," shall be paid at the time, if
         ever, that Liberty Media Group  deconsolidates from the AT&T income tax
         return. Liberty Media Group's receivable under the 1997 TCI Tax Sharing
         Agreement  of  approximately  $220 million was forgiven in the AT&T Tax
         Sharing  Agreement and recorded as an adjustment to combined  equity by
         Liberty Media Group in connection with the AT&T Merger.

(10)     Combined Equity

         Stock Repurchase and Issuances

         On April 8, 1999,  Liberty Media Group redeemed all of its  outstanding
         4-1/2% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due February 15, 2005. The
         debentures  were  convertible  into shares of AT&T Liberty  Media Group
         Class A Tracking Stock at a conversion price of $23.54, or 42.48 shares
         per $1,000  principal  amount.  Certain  holders of the  debentures had
         exercised  their rights to convert  their  debentures  and 14.6 million
         shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group  Tracking  Stock were issued to such
         holders.  In connection  with such issuance of AT&T Liberty Media Group
         Tracking Stock, Liberty Media Group recorded a $354 million increase to
         combined equity.

         During the nine months ended  September  30, 1998,  pursuant to a stock
         repurchase  program,  Liberty Media Group repurchased 239,450 shares of
         TCI's then  outstanding  TCI Ventures Group Stock and 766,783 shares of
         TCI's then  outstanding  Liberty Media Group Stock at an aggregate cost
         of approximately $30 million. Such amount is reflected as a decrease to
         combined equity in the accompanying combined financial statements.

         In conjunction with a stock repurchase program or similar  transaction,
         the  issuer  may elect to sell put  options  on its own  common  stock.
         Proceeds from any sales of puts with respect to TCI's then  outstanding
         TCI Ventures Group Tracking  Stock and TCI's then  outstanding  Liberty
         Media  Group  Tracking  Stock have been  reflected  as an  increase  to
         combined equity,  and an amount equal to the maximum  redemption amount
         under  unexpired put options with respect to such  tracking  stocks was
         reflected as an "obligation to redeem common stock" in the accompanying
         combined  balance  sheets.  At  September  30,  1999  no  amounts  were
         outstanding under such arrangements.

         Stock Issuances by Subsidiary

         On  September  9, 1999,  Liberty  Media  Group and TCI  Music,  renamed
         Liberty Digital, Inc. ("Liberty Digital"), completed a transaction (the
         "Liberty  Digital  Transaction")  pursuant to which Liberty Media Group
         contributed to Liberty Digital  substantially  all of its directly held
         internet  content  and  interactive  television  assets,  its rights to
         provide  interactive video services on AT&T's cable television  systems
         and a combination of cash and notes  receivable  equal to $150 million.
         Liberty Digital issued common stock and convertible  preferred stock to
         Liberty Media Group.

         As a result of the transaction and assuming conversion of the preferred
         stock,  Liberty Media Group holds  approximately  12 million  shares of
         Liberty Digital Series A common stock and  approximately  197.7 million
         shares of Series B common stock resulting in approximately 94.5% equity
         interest and 99% voting interest in Liberty Digital.

         Prior  to the  Liberty  Digital  Transaction,  Liberty  Digital  issued
         approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock in connection with the
         conversion of its preferred stock and  approximately 0.5 million shares
         of common stock in  connection  with the  exercise of certain  employee
         stock options.  As a result,  Liberty Media Group's interest in Liberty
         Digital was reduced to 86%. Following the Liberty Digital  Transaction,
         Liberty  Media  Group's  interest in Liberty  Digital was  increased to
         94.5%.  During the month of September,  1999,  Liberty  Digital  issued
         approximately 0.5 million shares of common stock in connection with the
         exercise of certain employee stock options. As a result,  Liberty Media
         Group's interest in Liberty Digital was reduced to 94.3%. In connection
         with the increase in Liberty Digital's  equity,  net of the dilution of
         Liberty Media Group's interest in Liberty  Digital,  that resulted from
         such stock  issuances,  Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  a $50  million
         increase to combined  equity.  No gain was  recognized  in the combined
         statement of operations and comprehensive earnings due to Liberty Media
         Group's  continuing  involvement  in  capital  transactions  of Liberty
         Digital.

         Transactions with AT&T (formerly TCI) and Other Related Parties

         Certain  subsidiaries  attributed to Liberty Media Group produce and/or
         distribute  sports and other  programming  and other  services to cable
         distribution operators (including AT&T) and others. Charges to AT&T are
         based upon  customary  rates  charged to others.  Amounts  included  in
         revenue for services  provided to AT&T were $125  million,  $43 million
         and $199 million for the seven month period ending  September 30, 1999,
         the two month period ending February 28, 1999 and the nine months ended
         September 30, 1998, respectively.

         Certain AT&T corporate general and administrative  costs are charged to
         Liberty  Media  Group  and  included  in  operating   expenses  in  the
         accompanying   combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive
         earnings.  During the seven month period ended  September 30, 1999, the
         two month  period  ended  February  28, 1999 and the nine months  ended
         September  30, 1998,  Liberty  Media Group was  allocated  less than $1
         million, $2 million and $12 million, respectively, in corporate general
         and administrative costs by AT&T.

         Entities  included in Liberty Media Group lease  satellite  transponder
         facilities  from NDTC. In connection  with the AT&T Merger,  NDTC is no
         longer  included in the  combined  financial  results of Liberty  Media
         Group.  Charges  by  NDTC  for  such  arrangements  and  other  related
         operating  expenses  for the seven  months  ended  September  30,  1999
         aggregated  $14 million and are included in  operating  expenses in the
         accompanying   combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive
         earnings.

                                   (continued)

         In connection with the AT&T Merger, warrants to buy 3 million shares of
         common  stock of CSG Systems  International,  Inc.  ("CSG") and related
         registration  rights were  transferred to Liberty Media Group. On April
         13, 1999, AT&T purchased these warrants from Liberty Media Group for an
         aggregate  purchase  price  of  $75  million  along  with  the  related
         registration  rights.  The vesting of the CSG warrants is contingent on
         AT&T meeting certain subscriber  commitments to CSG. If any warrants do
         not vest,  Liberty Media Group must  repurchase  the unvested  warrants
         from  AT&T,  with  interest  at 6% from  April 12,  1999.  Accordingly,
         Liberty  Media Group has recorded the unvested CSG warrants as deferred
         income until such time as the CSG warrants vest.

         A  subsidiary  of  Liberty  Media  Group  issued   preferred  stock  in
         connection  with a previous  acquisition  which was  convertible at the
         option of the holders  into  1,084,056  of TCI's then  outstanding  TCI
         Group Series A Common Stock. In July 1998,  Liberty Media Group entered
         into an equity swap  transaction with a commercial bank, which provided
         Liberty  Media Group with the right but not the  obligation  to acquire
         1,084,056 shares of TCI's then outstanding TCI Group Series A Stock for
         approximately  $45 million on or before April 19, 1999.  Liberty  Media
         Group  exercised its right under this equity swap  transaction and used
         the TCI Group  Series A Stock to satisfy the exchange  requirements  of
         the aforementioned preferred stock during the two months ended February
         28, 1999.  In  connection  with such  transaction,  Liberty Media Group
         recorded an $18 million  decrease to combined equity for the difference
         between the exercise price of the right and the carrying  amount of the
         preferred stock.

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, a limited liability company owned by Dr. John
         C. Malone  (Liberty  Media  Group's  Chairman)  acquired,  from certain
         subsidiaries  of Liberty Media Group,  for $17 million,  working cattle
         ranches  located in  Wyoming.  No gain or loss was  recognized  on such
         acquisition.  The  purchase  price was paid by such  limited  liability
         company  in the form of a 12-month  note in the  amount of $17  million
         having an interest rate of 7%. Such note is payable at any time without
         penalty and is personally guaranteed by Dr. Malone.

         In  connection  with the AT&T  Merger,  Liberty  Media  Group  paid two
         directors of Liberty Media  Corporation and one other  individual,  all
         three of whom are  directors  of TCI, an  aggregate  of $12 million for
         services  rendered in connection  with the AT&T Merger.  Such amount is
         included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for
         the two months  ended  February 28, 1999 in the  accompanying  combined
         statements of operations and comprehensive earnings.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         On February 9, 1998, in connection with the settlement of certain legal
         proceedings  relative  to the  Estate  of  Bob  Magness  (the  "Magness
         Estate"), the late founder and former Chairman of the Board of TCI, TCI
         entered into a call  agreement  with Dr.  Malone and Dr.  Malone's wife
         (together with Dr. Malone,  the  "Malones"),  and a call agreement with
         the Estate of Bob Magness,  the Estate of Betsy  Magness,  Gary Magness
         (individually and in certain representative capacities) and Kim Magness
         (individually and in certain representative  capacities) (collectively,
         the "Magness Group"). Under these call agreements,  each of the Magness
         Group and the  Malones  granted to TCI the right to acquire  all of the
         shares of TCI's common stock owned by them ("High Voting  Shares") that
         entitle  the  holder  to  cast  more  than  one  vote  per  share  (the
         "High-Voting  Stock") upon Dr.  Malone's  death or upon a  contemplated
         sale of the  High-Voting  Shares (other than a minimal amount) to third
         parties. In either such event, TCI had the right to acquire such shares
         at a price  equal to the then  market  price of shares of TCI's  common
         stock of the  corresponding  series that entitled the holder to cast no
         more  than one vote per  share  (the  "Low-Voting  Stock"),  plus a 10%
         premium,  or in the case of a sale,  the  lesser of such  price and the
         price  offered by the third  party.  In addition,  each call  agreement
         provides  that if TCI were ever to be sold to a third  party,  then the
         maximum premium that the Magness Group or the Malones would receive for
         their  High-Voting  Shares  would be the price  paid for  shares of the
         relevant  series of  Low-Voting  Stock by the third  party,  plus a 10%
         premium.  Each call  agreement also prohibits any member of the Magness
         Group or the Malones from disposing of their High-Voting Shares, except
         for certain exempt  transfers  (such as transfers to related parties or
         to the other group or public sales of up to an aggregate of 5% of their
         High-Voting  Shares  after  conversion  to  the  respective  series  of
         Low-Voting  Stock) and except for a transfer  made in  compliance  with
         TCI's  purchase  right  described  above.  TCI paid $150 million to the
         Malones and $124 million to the Magness Group in consideration of their
         entering  into the call  agreements,  of  which  an  aggregate  of $140
         million was allocated to and paid by Liberty Media Group.

         Also in February 1998,  TCI, the Magness Group and the Malones  entered
         into a shareholders'  agreement which provides for, among other things,
         certain  participation  rights by the  Magness  Group  with  respect to
         transactions by Dr. Malone, and certain  "tag-along" rights in favor of
         the  Magness  Group  and  certain  "drag-along"  rights in favor of the
         Malones,  with respect to transactions in the High-Voting  Stock.  Such
         agreement  also  provides  that a  representative  of Dr.  Malone and a
         representative of the Magness Group will consult with each other on all
         matters to be brought to a vote of TCI's shareholders,  but if a mutual
         agreement  on how to vote cannot be reached,  Dr.  Malone will vote the
         High-Voting Stock owned by the Magness Group pursuant to an irrevocable
         proxy granted by the Magness Group.

         In connection with the AT&T merger, Liberty Media Group became entitled
         to exercise  TCI's rights and became subject to its  obligations  under
         the call agreement and the shareholders'  agreement with respect to the
         Liberty Media Group Class B tracking  stock acquired by the Malones and
         the  Magness  Group as a result of the AT&T  merger.  If Liberty  Media
         Group were to exercise its call right under the call agreement with the
         Malones or the  Magness  Group,  it may also be  required  to  purchase
         High-Voting  Shares  of the other  group if such  group  exercises  its
         "tag-along" rights under the shareholders' agreement.

(11)     Commitments and Contingencies

         Encore Media Group,  a wholly owned  subsidiary of Liberty Media Group,
         is obligated to pay fees for the rights to exhibit  certain  films that
         are released by various  producers  through  2017 (the "Film  Licensing
         Obligations").  Based on customer  levels at September 30, 1999,  these
         agreements  require minimum  payments  aggregating  approximately  $887
         million.  The aggregate amount of the Film Licensing  Obligations under
         these license agreements is not currently estimable because such amount
         is dependent upon the number of qualifying films released  theatrically
         by certain  motion picture  studios as well as the domestic  theatrical
         exhibition   receipts  upon  the  release  of  such  qualifying  films.
         Nevertheless,  required  aggregate  payments  under the Film  Licensing
         Obligations could prove to be significant.

         Flextech has undertaken to finance the working capital  requirements of
         a joint  venture,  (the  "Principal  Joint  Venture")  formed  with BBC
         Worldwide and is obligated to provide the Principal  Joint Venture with
         a primary  credit  facility of  (pound)88  million  ($145  million) and
         subject to certain restrictions, a standby credit facility of (pound)30
         million ($49 million).  As of September 30, 1999,  the Principal  Joint
         Venture had borrowed  (pound)45 million ($74 million) under the primary
         credit facility.  If Flextech defaults on its funding obligation to the
         Principal  Joint Venture and fails to cure within 42 days after receipt
         of notice from BBC  Worldwide,  BBC  Worldwide is entitled,  within the
         following 90 days,  to require  that Liberty  Media Group assume all of
         Flextech's funding obligations to the Principal Joint Venture.

         Liberty  Media  Group has  guaranteed  various  loans,  notes  payable,
         letters of credit and other obligations (the "Guaranteed  Obligations")
         of  certain   affiliates.   At  September  30,  1999,   the  Guaranteed
         Obligations aggregated approximately $496 million.  Currently,  Liberty
         Media  Group is not  certain of the  likelihood  of being  required  to
         perform under such guarantees.

                                   (continued)

         Liberty  Media Group  leases  business  offices,  has entered into pole
         rental and  transponder  lease  agreements  and uses certain  equipment
         under lease arrangements.

         On September 21, 1998,  Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico and caused
         considerable property damage to the area in general,  including Liberty
         Media Group's Puerto Rico  subsidiary's  cable television  systems (the
         "Puerto  Rico   Subsidiary").   The  Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary's   cable
         television  systems  represent  $31  million of Liberty  Media  Group's
         revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 1999.

         As of  September  30,  1999,  approximately  99%  of  the  Puerto  Rico
         Subsidiary's   pre-hurricane   basic  customers  were  receiving  cable
         television  services.  The loss of  revenue  from  September  21,  1998
         through   September   30,  1999  was  $13  million.   The  Puerto  Rico
         Subsidiary's  business  interruption  insurance  covered  the  first $3
         million in lost revenue.

         The Puerto Rico  Subsidiary  has also  claimed  coverage  for  business
         interruption under a secondary  insurance carrier.  Such policy,  which
         covers the Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary's  parent  company's  subsidiaries,
         carries a deductible of $2.5 million.  This insurance  claim is subject
         to approval by such insurance carrier and accordingly, no assurance can
         be given that amounts claimed will be paid in their entirety.  However,
         in the event  such  claims are  collected  the  overall  impact in lost
         revenues  for the  Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary  as a result  of  Hurricane
         Georges will not exceed $2.5 million.

         Liberty  Media  Group  has  contingent  liabilities  related  to  legal
         proceedings  and  other  matters  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of
         business.  Although it is reasonably  possible  Liberty Media Group may
         incur losses upon  conclusion of such matters,  an estimate of any loss
         or range of loss cannot be made.  In the opinion of  management,  it is
         expected  that amounts,  if any,  which may be required to satisfy such
         contingencies  will not be material  in  relation  to the  accompanying
         combined financial statements.

         During the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  Liberty Media Group,
         in conjunction with AT&T, continued its enterprise-wide,  comprehensive
         efforts  to assess and  remediate  its  computer  systems  and  related
         software and equipment to ensure such  systems,  software and equipment
         recognize,   process  and  store  information  in  the  year  2000  and
         thereafter.  AT&T's year 2000 remediation efforts include an assessment
         of  Liberty  Media  Group's  most  critical  systems,   equipment,  and
         facilities.  AT&T also  continued  its  efforts to verify the year 2000
         readiness of Liberty  Media Group's  significant  suppliers and vendors
         and continued to communicate  with  significant  business  partners and
         affiliates to assess such partners and affiliates' year 2000 status.

         Failure to achieve year 2000  compliance  by Liberty  Media Group,  its
         significant  business  partners  and  affiliates  with  which  it has a
         relationship  could negatively  affect Liberty Media Group's ability to
         conduct business for an extended period. There can be no assurance that
         all of Liberty Media Group's computer systems and related software will
         be fully year 2000  compliant;  in addition,  other  companies on which
         Liberty  Media  Group's  computer  systems  and  related  software  and
         operations  rely may or may not be fully  compliant on a timely  basis,
         and any such failure  could have a material  adverse  effect on Liberty
         Media Group's financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                               September 30, 1999
                                   (unaudited)

(1)      Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
         of Tele-Communications, Inc. and those of all of its subsidiaries
         ("TCI" or the "Company"). On March 9, 1999, AT&T acquired TCI in a
         merger transaction (the "AT&T Merger"). For financial reporting
         purposes the AT&T Merger and related restructuring transactions
         described in note 2 are deemed to have occurred on March 1, 1999. The
         consolidated financial statements for periods prior to March 1, 1999
         are referred to herein as "Old TCI", and the consolidated financial
         statements for periods subsequent to February 28, 1999 are referred to
         herein as "New TCI." Due to the March 1, 1999 application of purchase
         accounting in connection with the AT&T Merger, the predecessor
         consolidated financial statements of Old TCI are not comparable to the
         successor consolidated financial statements of New TCI. In the
         following text, "TCI" and "the Company" refer to both Old TCI and New
         TCI. See note 2.

         All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
         eliminated in consolidation.

         The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements are
         unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments
         (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair
         presentation of the results for such periods. The results of operations
         for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for
         the full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read
         in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
         thereto contained in TCI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
         ended December 31, 1998.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
         and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
         liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, TCI generally recognized changes in its
         proportionate share of the underlying equity of a subsidiary or equity
         method investee, which resulted from the issuance of additional equity
         securities by such subsidiary or equity investee, in the consolidated
         statement of operations. Upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, TCI
         began to account for such changes in the underlying equity of its
         subsidiaries and affiliates as equity transactions in order to conform
         with AT&T's accounting policy.

         Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparability
         with the current period presentation.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         Targeted Stock

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, the Company's assets and operations were
         included in three separate groups, each of which was tracked separately
         by public equity securities. These groups were formerly known as the
         "Liberty Media Group" (referred to herein as the "Old Liberty Group"),
         the "TCI Ventures Group" and the "TCI Group."

         Old Liberty Group was intended to reflect the separate performance of
         TCI's assets which produce and distribute programming services.

         The TCI Ventures Group was intended to reflect the separate performance
         of TCI's principal international assets and businesses and
         substantially all of TCI's non-cable and non-programming assets.

         The TCI Group was intended to reflect the separate performance of TCI
         and its subsidiaries and assets not attributed to Old Liberty Group or
         TCI Ventures Group. Such subsidiaries and assets are comprised
         primarily of TCI's domestic cable and communications business.

         TCI Group, Old Liberty Group and TCI Ventures Group individually may be
         referred to herein as a "Group."

         The TCI Group was tracked separately through the Tele-Communications,
         Inc. Series A TCI Group Common Stock (the "TCI Group Series A Stock")
         and Series B TCI Group Common Stock (the "TCI Group Series B Stock,"
         and together with the TCI Group Series A Stock, the "TCI Group Stock").
         The Old Liberty Group was tracked through the Tele-Communications, Inc.
         Series A Liberty Media Group Common Stock ("Liberty Group Series A
         Stock") and Series B Liberty Media Group Common Stock ("Liberty Group
         Series B Stock" and together with the Liberty Group Series A Stock, the
         "Liberty Group Stock"). The TCI Ventures Group was tracked separately
         through the Tele-Communications, Inc. Series A TCI Ventures Group
         Common Stock ("TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock") and Series B TCI
         Ventures Group Common Stock ("TCI Ventures Group Series B Stock" and
         together with the TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock, the "TCI Ventures
         Group Stock").

         Upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, each of the separate series of
         Tele-Communications, Inc. common stock was converted either into shares
         of AT&T common stock, par value $1.00 per share, ("AT&T Common Stock")
         or shares of one of two classes of a new AT&T tracking stock designated
         to track the combined Old Liberty Group and TCI Ventures Group after
         giving effect to certain asset transfers. See note 2.

                                                                     (continued)

(2)      Merger with AT&T and Related Accounting

         On March 9, 1999, AT&T acquired TCI in the AT&T Merger, in which Italy
         Merger Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, merged with and into
         TCI, and TCI thereby became a subsidiary of AT&T. As a result of the
         AT&T Merger, (i) each share of TCI Group Series A Stock was converted
         into 1.16355 shares of AT&T Common Stock, (ii) each share of TCI Group
         Series B Stock was converted into 1.27995 shares of AT&T Common Stock,
         (iii) each share of Liberty Group Series A Stock was converted into 2
         shares of a newly created class of AT&T common stock designated as the
         Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share
         (the "AT&T Liberty Class A Tracking Stock"), (iv) each share of Liberty
         Group Series B Stock was converted into 2 shares of a newly created
         class of AT&T common stock designated as the Class B Liberty Media
         Group Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "AT&T Liberty Class
         B Tracking Stock" and together with the AT&T Liberty Class A Tracking
         Stock, the "AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock"), (v) each share of TCI
         Ventures Group Series A Stock was converted into 1.04 shares of AT&T
         Liberty Class A Tracking Stock, (vi) each share of TCI Ventures Group
         Series B Stock was converted into 1.04 shares of AT&T Liberty Class B
         Tracking Stock, (vii) each share of TCI's Convertible Preferred Stock,
         Series C-TCI Group (the "Series C-TCI Group Preferred Stock") was
         converted into 154.589253 shares of AT&T Common Stock, (viii) each
         share of TCI's Convertible Preferred Stock Series C-Liberty Media Group

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The shares of AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock issued in the AT&T Merger are
         intended to reflect the separate performance of the businesses and
         assets attributed to Old Liberty Group and TCI Ventures Group at the
         time of the AT&T Merger. References herein to "Liberty/Ventures Group"
         refer to the combined assets and businesses of Old Liberty Group and
         TCI Ventures Group for periods prior to the AT&T Merger, and subsequent
         to the AT&T Merger such combined assets and business are referred to as
         "Liberty Media Group." Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and
         conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Restructuring and
         Merger, dated as of June 23, 1998 (the "Merger Agreement"), immediately
         prior to the AT&T Merger, certain assets previously attributed to TCI
         Ventures Group (including, among others, the shares of AT&T Common
         Stock received in the merger of AT&T and Teleport Communications Group,
         Inc. ("TCG"), the stock of At Home Corporation ("@Home") attributed to
         TCI Ventures Group, the assets and business of the National Digital
         Television Center, Inc. ("NDTC") and TCI Ventures Group's equity
         interest in Western Tele-Communications, Inc. ("WTCI")) were
         transferred to TCI Group in exchange for approximately $5.5 billion in
         cash. Also, upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, through a new tax
         sharing agreement between Liberty Media Group and AT&T, Liberty Media
         Group became entitled to the benefit of approximately $2 billion of net
         operating loss carryforwards attributable to all entities included in
         TCI's consolidated federal income tax return as of the date of the AT&T
         Merger. Such net operating loss carryforwards are subject to adjustment
         by the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to limitations on usage
         which may affect the ultimate amount utilized. Additionally, certain
         warrants to purchase shares of General Instruments Corporation ("GI")
         previously attributed to TCI Group were transferred to Liberty/Ventures
         Group in exchange for approximately $176 million in cash. The transfer
         of certain immaterial assets was also effected.

         Immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, AT&T and Liberty Media
         Corporation entered into an agreement relating to the carriage of
         programming of Liberty Media Group to be distributed over the AT&T
         cable systems. Pursuant to this agreement, Liberty Media Group will be
         granted, among other rights, "preferred vendor status" with respect to
         certain types of new programming services. Liberty Media Group will
         also be entitled to the use of channel capacity equal to one six
         megahertz channel to be used for category specific interactive video
         channels. In addition, such agreement also provided for the extension
         of existing affiliation agreements between TCI and programming
         affiliates of Liberty Media Group to a date not less than 10 years from
         the closing of the AT&T Merger, upon the terms and conditions set forth
         in such agreement.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         Pursuant to amended corporate governance documents for the entities
         included in Liberty Media Group and certain agreements among AT&T and
         TCI, the business of Liberty Media Group will continue to be managed by
         certain persons who were members of TCI's management prior to the AT&T
         Merger. AT&T will initially designate one third of the directors of
         such entities and its rights as the sole shareholder of the common
         stock of such entities following the AT&T Merger will, in accordance
         with Delaware law, be limited to actions which will require shareholder
         approval. Therefore, management has concluded that TCI does not have a
         controlling financial interest (as that term is used in Statement of
         Financial Accounting Standards No. 94) in the entities comprising the
         Liberty Media Group following the AT&T Merger, and will account for its
         ownership interests in such entities under the equity method.

         Immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, TCI restructured its ownership of
         certain of its subsidiaries (the "Restructuring"). The Restructuring
         included merging TCI's cable subsidiary, TCI Communications, Inc.
         ("TCIC"), into TCI. As a result of TCIC's merger with TCI, all assets
         and liabilities of TCIC have been assumed by TCI, including TCIC's
         public debt. In connection with TCIC's merger with TCI, each share of
         TCIC's Cumulative Exchangeable Preferred Stock, Series A was converted
         into 2.119 shares of TCI Group Series A Stock, and such shares of TCI
         Group Series A Stock were subsequently converted into AT&T Common Stock
         in connection with the AT&T Merger. All other public securities issued
         by subsidiaries of TCIC (other than TCI Pacific Communications, Inc.
         ("Pacific")) otherwise remained unaffected. Furthermore, as part of the
         Restructuring, (i) AT&T loaned TCI $5.5 billion pursuant to a
         promissory note, (ii) certain asset transfers were made between TCI and
         its subsidiaries, (iii) 123,896 shares of the Company's Convertible
         Redeemable Participating Preferred Stock, Series F ("Series F Preferred
         Stock") which were held by subsidiaries of TCI, were converted into
         185,428,946 shares of TCI Group Series A Stock (which in turn were
         converted into 215,755,850 shares of AT&T Common Stock in the AT&T
         Merger and continue to be held by subsidiaries of TCI), (iv) the
         remaining 154,411 shares of Series F Preferred Stock which were
         formerly held by subsidiaries of TCI were distributed to TCI through a
         series of liquidations and canceled, and (v) 125,728,816 shares of TCI
         Group Series A Stock, 9,154,134 shares of TCI Group Series B Stock,
         6,654,367 shares of Liberty Group Series A Stock, 3,417,187 shares of
         Liberty Group Series B Stock, and 67,536 shares of Class B Preferred
         Stock, each formerly held by subsidiaries of TCI, were distributed to
         TCI through a series of liquidations and canceled.

         Under the terms of the 5% Class A Senior Cumulative Exchangeable
         Preferred Stock of Pacific (the "Exchangeable Preferred Stock"), each
         share of that preferred stock is exchangeable, from and after August 1,
         2001, for approximately 6.3375 shares of AT&T Common Stock, subject to
         certain anti-dilution adjustments. Additionally, Pacific may elect to
         make any dividend, redemption or liquidation payment on the
         Exchangeable Preferred Stock in cash, by delivery of shares of AT&T
         Common Stock or by a combination of the foregoing forms of
         consideration.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The AT&T Merger has been accounted for using the purchase method of
         accounting and has been deemed to be effective as of March 1, 1999 for
         financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the preliminary allocation
         of AT&T's purchase price to acquire Old TCI has been reflected in TCI's
         consolidated financial statements as of March 1, 1999. A final
         allocation of such purchase price will be made upon resolution of
         pre-acquisition contingencies and receipt of final third party
         appraisals. Certain transactions occurring between March 1, 1999 and
         March 9, 1999 that affected Old TCI's equity and stock compensation
         have been reflected in the two-month period ended February 28, 1999.
         The $52.2 billion aggregate value assigned to TCI's net assets as a
         result of the application of purchase accounting was comprised of the
         following:

         The value assigned to the AT&T Common Stock was based on the average
         closing price of AT&T Common Stock a few days before and after the AT&T
         Merger was agreed to and announced. The value assigned to the AT&T
         Liberty Tracking Stock was based on the average closing price of
         Liberty Group Stock a few days before and after the AT&T Merger was
         agreed to and announced. The Liberty Group Stock was used to value the
         AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock issued in the AT&T Merger because the fair
         value of Liberty Group Stock was more readily determinable than the
         fair value of the AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         As a result of the application of purchase accounting, New TCI has
         recorded its assets and liabilities at their preliminary fair values on
         March 9, 1999. During the third quarter of 1999, $19 billion of
         goodwill recorded in connection with the preliminary allocation of
         AT&T's purchase price to acquire Old TCI was reclassified to franchise
         costs. Franchise costs represent the value attributable to the
         agreements with local franchise authorities that allow access to homes
         in TCI's service areas. As with goodwill, franchise costs are amortized
         over 40 years. Generally accepted accounting principles require
         deferred income taxes to be recorded on the difference between the
         financial reporting basis and income tax basis of franchise costs,
         whereas no such requirement exists for goodwill. Accordingly, during
         the third quarter of 1999, New TCI recorded an increase to its deferred
         income tax liability of approximately $12 billion, and recorded an
         equal and offsetting increase to franchise costs. This reclassification
         and its related deferred income tax effects were given retroactive
         effect to the March 9, 1999 acquisition date in order to provide for
         meaningful comparisons. Such retroactive treatment had no impact on New
         TCI's net loss since the increased amortization of franchise costs was
         fully offset by the deferred income tax benefit of such amortization.
         During the second and third quarters of 1999, further refinements were
         also made to the preliminary allocation of AT&T's purchase price to
         acquire Old TCI as a result of the appraisal process. Refinements of
         the allocation of AT&T's purchase price to acquire Old TCI are treated
         as changes in estimates and accounted for prospectively. As of
         September 30, 1999, the allocation of AT&T's purchase price to acquire
         Old TCI had not been finalized. Accordingly, the Company may make
         additional refinements to the preliminary allocation of AT&T's purchase
         price to acquire Old TCI in future periods. In addition to the above,
         certain of the more significant effects of purchase accounting are
         described below.

         New TCI's intangible assets in the March 1, 1999 opening consolidated
         balance sheet also include $594 million of in-process research and
         development costs. Such amount reflects the value, as of the
         acquisition date, of the Company's research and development projects
         which had not yet reached technological feasibility and which had no
         alternative future use. Such in-process research and development costs
         were written-off during March 1999.

         As a result of the application of purchase accounting, the amount
         assigned to New TCI's other liabilities includes $237 million which
         represents New TCI's estimated liability for unvested stock
         appreciation rights as of March 9, 1999. Such unvested stock
         appreciation rights will vest over remaining periods ranging from 1 to
         5 years. The amount assigned to New TCI's minority interests in equity
         of consolidated subsidiaries includes $2.1 billion which represents the
         fair value of the redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary. For
         additional information regarding the effects of purchase accounting on
         New TCI's assets and liabilities, see notes 6, 8, 9 and 13.

         The following unaudited condensed results of operations for the nine
         months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 were prepared assuming the
         AT&T Merger, the Restructuring and the deconsolidation of Liberty Media
         Group occurred on January 1, 1998. These pro forma amounts are not
         necessarily indicative of operating results which would have occurred
         if the AT&T Merger, the Restructuring and the deconsolidation of
         Liberty Media Group had occurred on January 1, 1998.

 (3)     Earnings (Loss) Per Common and Potential Common Share

         Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is measured as the income or loss
         attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average
         outstanding common shares for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to
         basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
         potential common shares as if they had been converted at the beginning
         of the periods presented. Potential common shares that have an
         anti-dilutive effect are excluded from diluted EPS. Basic and diluted
         EPS are presented only for periods prior to the AT&T Merger. Subsequent
         to the AT&T Merger, all shares of common stock of TCI are held by AT&T.
         See notes 1 and 2.

         (a)      TCI Group Stock

                  The basic earnings (loss) attributable to TCI Group common
                  stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February 28, 1999 and the three and nine month periods ended
                  September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing net earnings
                  (loss) attributable to TCI Group common stockholders by the
                  weighted average number of common shares outstanding of TCI
                  Group Stock during the period.

                  The diluted loss attributable to TCI Group common stockholders
                  per common share for the two months ended February 28, 1999
                  was computed by dividing net loss attributable to TCI Group
                  common stockholders, which is increased by aggregate fees paid
                  on equity swap facilities of $4 million during 1999, by the
                  weighted average number of common shares outstanding of TCI
                  Group Stock during the period. Potential common shares were
                  not included in the computation of weighted average shares
                  outstanding because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                  The diluted earnings attributable to TCI Group common
                  stockholders per common share for the three and nine months
                  ended September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing net earnings
                  attributable to TCI Group common stockholders, which is
                  adjusted by the addition of preferred stock dividends and
                  interest accrued during the three and nine months ended
                  September 30, 1998 to net earnings, assuming conversion of TCI
                  Group convertible securities as of the beginning of the period
                  to the extent that the assumed conversion of such securities
                  would have been dilutive, by the weighted average number of
                  common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding
                  of TCI Group Stock during the period. Shares issuable upon
                  conversion of the Series C-TCI Group Preferred Stock, the
                  Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D ("Series D Preferred
                  Stock"), the Series G Preferred Stock, certain stock rights,
                  preferred stock of subsidiaries, convertible notes payable,
                  stock options and other performance awards have been included
                  in the diluted calculation of weighted average shares to the
                  extent that the assumed issuance of such shares would have
                  been dilutive, as illustrated below. All of the outstanding
                  shares of Series D Preferred Stock were redeemed effective
                  April 1, 1998.

                  In connection with the March 9, 1999 AT&T Merger, TCI Group
                  Stock was converted into AT&T Common Stock. See note 2.

                  The basic earnings (loss) attributable to Old Liberty Group
                  common stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February 28, 1999 and the three and nine month periods ended
                  September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing net earnings
                  (loss) attributable to Old Liberty Group common stockholders
                  by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of
                  Liberty Group Stock during the period.

                  The diluted loss attributable to Old Liberty Group common
                  stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February 28, 1999 and the three months ended September 30,
                  1998 was computed by dividing the net loss attributable to Old
                  Liberty Group stockholders by the weighted average number of
                  common shares outstanding of Liberty Group Stock during the
                  period. Potential common shares were not included in the
                  computation of weighted average shares outstanding because
                  their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

                  The diluted earnings attributable to Old Liberty Group common
                  stockholders per common and potential common share for the
                  nine months ended September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing
                  earnings attributable to Old Liberty Group common stockholders
                  by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
                  potential common shares outstanding of Liberty Group Stock
                  during the period. Shares issuable upon conversion of the
                  Series C-Liberty Media Group Preferred Stock, the Series D
                  Preferred Stock, the Series H Preferred Stock, convertible
                  notes payable, stock options and other performance awards have
                  been included in the diluted calculation of weighted average
                  shares to the extent that the assumed issuance of such shares
                  would have been dilutive, as illustrated below. All of the
                  outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock were redeemed
                  effective April 1, 1998. Numerator adjustments for dividends
                  and interest associated with the convertible preferred shares
                  and convertible notes payable, respectively, were not made to
                  the computation of diluted earnings per share as such
                  dividends and interest were paid by TCI Group.

                  In connection with the AT&T Merger, Liberty Group Stock was
                  converted into AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock. See note 2.

         (c)      TCI Ventures Group Stock

                  The basic earnings (loss) attributable to TCI Ventures Group
                  common stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February 28, 1999 and the three and nine month periods ended
                  September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing net earnings
                  (loss) attributable to TCI Ventures Group common stockholders
                  by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of
                  TCI Ventures Group Stock during the period.

                  The diluted loss attributable to TCI Ventures Group common
                  stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February 28, 1999 was computed by dividing the net loss
                  attributable to TCI Ventures Group stockholders by the
                  weighted average number of common shares outstanding of TCI
                  Ventures Group during the period. In 1999, the net loss
                  attributable to TCI Ventures Group common stockholders is
                  increased by $29 million for charges recorded directly to
                  equity upon settlement of an equity swap transaction. See note
                  10. For purposes of computing diluted EPS such amount is
                  assumed to be charged to earnings. Potential common shares
                  were not included in the computation of weighted average
                  shares outstanding because their inclusion would be
                  anti-dilutive.

                  The diluted earnings attributable to TCI Ventures Group common
                  stockholders per common share for the three and nine month
                  periods ended September 30, 1998 was computed by dividing net
                  earnings attributable to TCI Ventures Group common
                  stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
                  outstanding of TCI Ventures Group Stock during the period.
                  Shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes payable,
                  stock options and other performance awards have been included
                  in the diluted calculation of weighted average shares to the
                  extent that the assumed issuance of such shares would have
                  been dilutive, as illustrated below. Numerator adjustments for
                  interest associated with convertible notes payable were not
                  made to the computation of diluted earnings per share as such
                  interest was paid by TCI Group.

                  In connection with the March 9, 1999 AT&T Merger, TCI Ventures
                  Group Stock was converted into AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The Company ceased to include TV Guide, Inc. ("TV Guide") in its
         consolidated financial results and began to account for TV Guide using
         the equity method of accounting effective February 28, 1999 (see note
         7). In addition, during the second quarter of 1999, the Company ceased
         to include @Home in its consolidated financial results and began to
         account for @Home using the equity method of accounting (see note 6).
         The effects of changing the method of accounting for the Company's
         ownership interests in TV Guide and @Home from the consolidation method
         to the equity method are summarized below:

(5)      Investment in Liberty Media Group

         As described in note 2, immediately following the AT&T Merger, the
         entities comprising the Liberty Media Group were deconsolidated. The
         Company's investment in Liberty Media Group includes non-interest
         bearing receivables from Liberty Media Group. Summarized unaudited
         results of operations for Liberty Media Group for the period in which
         the Company used the equity method to account for Liberty Media Group
         are as follows:

</TABLE>


         During March and April 1999, certain convertible debentures of a
         subsidiary attributed to the Liberty Media Group were converted into
         shares of AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock. The $354 million principal
         amount of such converted debentures has been reflected as an increase
         to New TCI's "Additional paid-in capital."

         The accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the
         seven months ended September 30, 1999 includes changes in Liberty Media
         Group's unrealized holding gains for available-for-sale securities
         totaling $2,320 million, net of taxes, and Liberty Media Group's
         foreign currency translation adjustments totaling $88 million, net of
         taxes.

         During the third quarter of 1999, AT&T utilized $85 million of Liberty
         Media Group's net operating loss carryforwards to offset AT&T's current
         federal income tax liability. Liberty Media Group did not receive any
         consideration for the utilization of such net operating loss
         carryforwards. Accordingly, AT&T's utilization of Liberty Media Group's
         net operating loss carryforwards has been reflected as a decrease to
         New TCI's "Additional paid-in capital."

                                                                     (continued)

         (a)      CSC

                  On March 4, 1998, the Company contributed to CSC certain of
                  its cable television systems serving approximately 830,000
                  customers in exchange for approximately 48.9 million newly
                  issued CSC Class A common shares (the "CSC Transaction"). CSC
                  also assumed and repaid approximately $574 million of debt
                  owed by the Company to external parties and $95 million of
                  debt owed to the Company. As a result of the CSC Transaction,
                  the Company recognized a $506 million gain in the accompanying
                  consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
                  September 30, 1998. Such gain represents the excess of the
                  $1,161 million fair value of the CSC Class A common shares
                  received over the historical cost of the net assets
                  transferred by the Company to CSC.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                  At September 30, 1999, the Company owned 48,942,172 shares of
                  CSC Class A common stock, which had a closing market price of
                  $72.75 per share on such date. Such shares represented an
                  approximate 32% equity interest in CSC's total outstanding
                  shares and an approximate 9% voting interest in CSC in all
                  matters except for (i) the election of directors, in which
                  case the Company effectively has the right to designate two of
                  CSC's directors, and (ii) any increase in authorized shares,
                  in which case the Company has agreed to vote its interest in
                  proportion with the public holders of CSC Class A common
                  shares. The ability of the Company to sell or increase its
                  investment in CSC is subject to certain restrictions and
                  limitations set forth in a stockholders agreement with CSC. As
                  a result of the deconsolidation of Liberty Media Group,
                  1,040,400 shares of CSC Class A common stock held by Liberty
                  Media Group are no longer included in the Company's investment
                  in CSC. See note 2.

         (b)      @Home

                  During the second quarter of 1999, the stockholders of @Home
                  approved certain changes in the corporate governance of @Home.
                  As a result of these changes, management concluded that TCI no
                  longer held a controlling financial interest (as that term is
                  used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94) in
                  @Home and, accordingly, during the second quarter of 1999, TCI
                  ceased to consolidate @Home and began to account for @Home
                  using the equity method of accounting.

                  On May 28, 1999, @Home consummated a merger agreement with
                  Excite, Inc. ("Excite"), a global Internet media company that
                  offers consumers and advertisers comprehensive Internet
                  navigation services with extensive personalization
                  capabilities. Under the terms of the merger agreement, @Home
                  issued approximately 116 million shares of its common stock
                  for all of the outstanding common stock of Excite based on an
                  exchange ratio of 2.083804 shares of @Home's common stock for
                  each share of Excite's common stock. @Home may issue up to
                  approximately 46 million additional shares of common stock in
                  connection with the assumption of obligations under Excite's
                  stock option and employer stock purchase plans and outstanding
                  warrants. As a result of the merger, TCI's economic interest
                  in @Home decreased from 38% to 26%. Due to the resulting
                  increase in @Home's equity, net of the dilution of TCI's
                  ownership interest in @Home, TCI recorded a $488 million
                  increase to "Additional paid-in capital" and a $312 million
                  increase to "Deferred income tax liability." At September 30,
                  1999, the Company owned 63,720,000 shares of @Home Class A
                  common stock, which had a closing market price of $41.44 per
                  share on such date.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                  During the two months ended February 28, 1999, @Home issued
                  2.2 million common shares. Due to the resulting increase in
                  @Home's equity, net of the dilution of TCI's ownership
                  interest in @Home, TCI recognized a gain of $17 million.

         (c)      Liberty Media Group Investments

                  As a result of the deconsolidation of Liberty Media Group, the
                  indicated investments are no longer included in the Company's
                  consolidated investments. See note 2.

         At September 30, 1999, the aggregate carrying value of the Company's
         investments in the Other Affiliates exceeded the Company's aggregate
         proportionate share of the Other Affiliates' underlying equity by $14.0
         billion, of which $8.4 billion, $4.2 billion and $1.4 billion is being
         amortized over 40 years, 25 years and 7 years, respectively.

         TCI has entered into various agreements, which, among other matters,
         contemplate the disposition of certain of its investments in the Other
         Affiliates. See note 7.

         Summarized unaudited combined results of operations for the Other
         Affiliates for the periods in which the Company used the equity method
         to account for the Other Affiliates are as follows:

(7)      Acquisitions and Dispositions

         On May 4, 1999, AT&T and Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") announced that
         they had signed a letter of intent to exchange various cable systems,
         including certain cable systems of TCI. In addition, Comcast will
         receive an option from AT&T to purchase, over the next three years,
         additional cable systems with a total of approximately 1.25 million
         subscribers, which may include cable subscribers of TCI. The foregoing
         letter of intent is subject to completion of definitive agreements,
         consummation of certain other transactions, and regulatory and legal
         approvals.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         On July 6, 1999, AT&T and Cox Communications, Inc. ("Cox") signed an
         agreement whereby AT&T would redeem approximately 50.3 million shares
         of AT&T Common Stock held by Cox in exchange for cable television
         systems of TCI serving approximately 316,000 customers and TCI's
         interest in certain equity method investments. The transaction is
         subject to receipt of necessary government and regulatory approvals. No
         assurance can be given that such transaction will be consummated. See
         note 6.

         TCI has entered into agreements with Century Communications Corp.
         ("Century") whereby TCI will contribute cable television systems
         serving approximately 249,000 customers located in Southern California
         to a newly formed limited partnership in which TCI will have an
         approximate 25% partnership interest. TCI will also exchange with the
         new partnership a cable television system serving approximately 100,000
         customers in Southern California for cable television systems in
         Northern California serving approximately 100,000 customers. The
         transactions are subject to various closing conditions. No assurance
         can be given that such transactions will be consummated. On October 1,
         1999, a merger was consummated in which Century merged with and into
         Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia"). As a result of such
         merger, Adelphia assumed all of Century's rights and obligations
         relating to the above described transaction.

         On October 1, 1999, TCI, InterMedia IV, and InterMedia Partners, a
         California Limited Partnership and a consolidated subsidiary of the
         Company ("InterMedia Partners"), entered into a series of transactions
         with unaffiliated third parties that resulted in the disposition of
         certain cable television systems, the acquisition by InterMedia IV of
         all of its partnership interests that were not owned by TCI and the
         exchange of certain of InterMedia IV's and InterMedia Partners' cable
         television systems. As a result of such transactions, InterMedia IV
         became a consolidated subsidiary of TCI. See notes 6 and 12.

         During the second quarter of 1999, TCI entered into separate agreements
         to sell the majority of its 50% interest in Bresnan (the "Bresnan
         Transaction") and its 46% interest in Falcon (the "Falcon Transaction")
         to Charter. In accordance with the terms of the Bresnan Transaction,
         TCI would receive consideration of approximately $900 million in the
         form of cash, and an approximate 4.5% interest in a new entity to be
         formed by Charter. In accordance with the terms of the Falcon
         Transaction, TCI would receive cash proceeds of approximately $725
         million for its interest in Falcon Communications, L.P. The
         transactions are subject to various closing conditions. No assurance
         can be given that such transactions will be consummated. See note 6.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         During the second quarter of 1999, the Company paid $41 million in cash
         and traded cable television systems serving approximately 618,000
         customers located in Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Ohio, Texas and
         Wisconsin in exchange for cable television systems serving
         approximately 565,000 customers located in Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon
         and Pennsylvania (the "1999 Exchange"). The 1999 Exchange was
         consummated pursuant to an agreement that was executed in November
         1998. No gain was recognized on the 1999 Exchange due to the Company's
         application of purchase accounting in connection with the AT&T Merger.

         During the two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company completed a
         transaction whereby the Company contributed cable television systems to
         Bresnan, an entity in which the Company had an approximate 80%
         ownership interest. Through a series of transactions, including the
         contribution of cash by a third party in exchange for an ownership
         interest in Bresnan, the Company's ownership interest in Bresnan was
         reduced to a non-controlling 50% ownership interest (the "1999
         Contribution Transaction"). In connection with the associated dilution
         of the Company's ownership interest, the Company deconsolidated assets
         and liabilities related to cable television systems serving
         approximately 614,000 customers. The deconsolidated liabilities
         included $210 million of debt owed to external parties and $709 million
         of intercompany debt owed to the Company. In connection with the 1999
         Contribution Transaction, the Company has agreed to take certain steps
         to support compliance by Bresnan with its payment obligations under
         certain debt instruments. See note 13. As a result of the dilution of
         the Company's ownership interest from 80% to 50%, the Company recorded
         a $9 million increase (net of deferred income taxes of $5 million) to
         additional paid-in capital in connection with the 1999 Contribution
         Transaction. No gain was recognized due to the Company's aforementioned
         commitment to support the entity's payment obligations under certain
         debt instruments.

         During February 1999, the Company sold cable television assets serving
         approximately 145,000 customers to an unaffiliated third party for
         approximately $300 million. The Company recorded a $123 million gain on
         such disposition.

         During the year ended 1998, the Company completed various transactions
         in addition to the CSC Transaction described in note 6, wherein the
         Company contributed cable television systems serving in the aggregate
         approximately 1.9 million customers to several joint ventures
         (collectively, the "1998 Joint Ventures") in exchange for
         non-controlling ownership interests in each of the 1998 Joint Ventures,
         and the assumption and repayment by the 1998 Joint Ventures of debt
         owed by the Company to external parties aggregating $323 million and
         intercompany debt owed to the Company aggregating $2,374 million. In
         connection with such transactions, the Company has agreed to take
         certain steps to support compliance by the 1998 Joint Ventures with
         their payment obligations under certain debt instruments. See notes 6
         and 13.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         Effective February 28, 1999, TV Guide (formerly United Video Satellite
         Group, Inc. ("UVSG")) and The News Corporation Limited ("News Corp.")
         completed a transaction whereby News Corp.'s TV Guide properties were
         combined with UVSG to create a platform for offering television guide
         services to consumers and advertising and the resulting company was
         named TV Guide. As part of this combination, a unit of News Corp.
         received consideration consisting of $800 million in cash and 60
         million shares of UVSG's stock, including 22.5 million shares of its
         Class A common stock and 37.5 million shares of its Class B common
         stock. In addition, News Corp. elected to purchase approximately 6.5
         million additional shares of UVSG Class A common stock for $129 million
         in order to equalize its ownership with that of Liberty/Ventures Group.
         Prior to such transactions, UVSG was a subsidiary of TCI. Immediately
         following these transactions, and another transaction completed on the
         same date, News Corp., Liberty/Ventures Group and TV Guide's public
         stockholders owned on an economic basis approximately 44%, 44% and 12%,
         respectively, of TV Guide and News Corp. and Liberty/Ventures Group
         each had approximately 49% of the voting power of TV Guide's
         outstanding stock. Due to the resulting increase in TV Guide's equity,
         net of the dilution of TCI's ownership interest in TV Guide, TCI
         recognized a $372 million gain (before deducting deferred income tax
         expense of $147 million).

         Effective September 1, 1998, Telewest Communications plc ("Telewest")
         and General Cable PLC ("General Cable") consummated a merger in which
         General Cable merged with and into Telewest. As a result of such
         merger, TCI's ownership interest in Telewest decreased to 22%. In
         connection with such dilution, TCI recognized a gain of $58 million
         (before deducting deferred income tax expense of $20 million).

         On July 23, 1998, a merger in which TCG agreed to be acquired by AT&T
         was consummated. See note 11. On April 22, 1998, TCG completed a merger
         transaction with ACC Corp. ("ACC") in which ACC shares were exchanged
         for shares of TCG. As a result of ACC's merger with TCG, Old TCI's
         interest in TCG was reduced to approximately 26%. In connection with
         the dilution of Old TCI's interest in TCG, Old TCI recorded a gain of
         $201 million (before deducting deferred income tax expense of $71
         million).

         Effective February 1, 1998, Turner-Vision, Inc. ("Turner Vision")
         contributed the assets, obligations and operations of its retail C-band
         satellite business to Superstar/Netlink Group LLC ("Superstar/Netlink")
         in exchange for an approximate 20% interest in Superstar/Netlink. As a
         result of this transaction, the Company's ownership interest in
         Superstar/Netlink decreased from 100% to approximately 80% and the
         Company recognized a gain of $38 million (before deducting deferred
         income tax expense of $15 million). Turner Vision's contribution to
         Superstar/Netlink was accounted for as a purchase, and the $61 million
         excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired
         was recorded as goodwill.

                                                                     (continued)

         (a)      Amounts outstanding under the notes payable to AT&T ("AT&T
                  Notes") bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate
                  ("LIBOR") plus 15 basis points (6.23% at September 30, 1999)
                  and are due and payable on or before March 9, 2004. Interest
                  on the AT&T Notes is compounded quarterly.

         (b)      During the seven months ended September 30, 1999, the Company
                  redeemed certain notes payable which had an aggregate
                  principal balance of $64.6 million and fixed interest rates
                  ranging from 7.875% to 8.75%. In connection with such
                  redemptions, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain on early
                  extinguishment of debt of $6 million. Such gain related to the
                  excess of the fair value assigned to the debt in purchase
                  accounting over the amount paid to redeem the debt.

                  During the two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company
                  redeemed certain notes payable which had an aggregate
                  principal balance of $21 million and fixed interest rates
                  ranging from 8.75% to 9.25%. In connection with such
                  redemptions, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on early
                  extinguishment of debt of $4 million. Such loss related to
                  prepayment penalties and the retirement of deferred loan
                  costs.

                  During the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company
                  redeemed certain notes payable which had an aggregate
                  principal balance of $352 million and fixed interest rates
                  ranging from 8.67% to 10.25%. In connection with such
                  redemptions, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on early
                  extinguishment of debt of $44 million in 1998. Such loss
                  related to prepayment penalties amounting to $39 million and
                  the retirement of deferred loan costs.

         (c)      During the two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company
                  repaid a bank credit facility. In connection with such
                  repayment, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on early
                  extinguishment of debt of $4 million. Such loss related to the

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                  As security for borrowings under one of Old TCI's credit
                  facilities, Old TCI had pledged a portion of its Time Warner
                  common stock. As a result of the deconsolidation of
                  Liberty/Ventures Group, such borrowings and the associated
                  Time Warner common stock are no longer reflected in the
                  Company's consolidated debt and asset balances.

         (d)      The convertible notes, which were stated net of unamortized
                  discount of $166 million at December 31, 1998, were scheduled
                  to mature on December 12, 2021. The notes required an annual
                  interest payment equal to 1.85% of the face amount of the
                  notes. On March 26, 1999, all of the notes were converted into
                  shares of AT&T Common Stock, AT&T Liberty Class A Tracking
                  Stock and TCI Satellite Entertainment, Inc. Series A common
                  stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Satellite Series A Common
                  Stock") in accordance with the terms of the notes. Following
                  such conversion, none of such notes remain outstanding. Such
                  notes were held by a then director of the Company, as well as
                  several members of his family. In connection with the AT&T
                  Merger, such director resigned. Immediately prior to the AT&T
                  Merger, the notes were convertible, at the option of the
                  holders, into an aggregate of 24,163,259 shares of TCI Group
                  Series A Stock, 19,416,889 shares of Liberty Group Series A
                  Stock, 20,711,364 shares of TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock
                  and 3,451,897 shares of Satellite Series A Common Stock.
                  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and a certain
                  stock purchase agreement, dated as of July 9, 1986, among the
                  Company and the holders of such convertible notes, the
                  conversion feature of the convertible notes was adjusted such
                  that as of the March 9, 1999 consummation date of the AT&T
                  Merger, such notes were convertible into an aggregate of
                  28,632,122 shares of AT&T Common Stock, 60,373,632 shares of
                  AT&T Liberty Class A Tracking Stock and 3,451,897 shares of
                  Satellite Series A Common Stock.

         Certain debt instruments of a subsidiary of the Company contain
         restrictive covenants which require, among other things, the
         maintenance of certain earnings, specified cash flow and financial
         ratios (primarily the ratios of cash flow to total debt and cash flow
         to debt service, as defined), and include certain limitations on
         indebtedness, investments, guarantees, dispositions, stock repurchases
         and/or dividend payments.

         The aggregate fair value assigned in purchase accounting to New TCI's
         debt and related variable and fixed interest rate exchange agreements
         ("Interest Rate Swaps") exceeded the aggregate recorded value at the
         date of the AT&T Merger by $938 million. Such excess is being amortized
         over the respective remaining 1 to 30 year lives of the underlying debt
         obligations and Interest Rate Swaps. See note 2.

         The fair value of the Company's debt, exclusive of the AT&T Notes, is
         estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar
         issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the
         same remaining maturities. At September 30, 1999, the fair value of the
         Company's debt, exclusive of the AT&T Notes, was $9,007 million, as
         compared to a carrying value of $9,449 million on such date. Due to its
         related party nature, it is not practical to obtain a reasonable
         estimate of the fair value of the AT&T Notes.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         In order to achieve the desired balance between variable and fixed rate
         indebtedness, the Company may enter into Interest Rate Swaps pursuant
         to which it (i) pays fixed interest rates (the "Fixed Rate Agreements")
         and receives variable interest rates and (ii) pays variable interest
         rates (the "Variable Rate Agreements") and receives fixed interest
         rates. At December 31, 1998, all of the Company's Fixed Rate Agreements
         had expired. During the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the
         Company's payments pursuant to the Fixed Rate Agreements were less than
         $1 million. During the seven months ended September 30, 1999, the two
         months ended February 28, 1999 and the nine months ended September 30,
         1998, the Company's net receipts pursuant to the Variable Rate
         Agreements were $16 million, $1 million and $8 million, respectively.

         Information concerning the Company's Variable Rate Agreements at
         September 30, 1999 is as follows:

         (a)      The estimated amount that the Company would receive (pay) to
                  terminate the agreements at September 30, 1999, taking into
                  consideration current interest rates and the current
                  creditworthiness of the counterparties, represents the fair
                  value of the Interest Rate Swaps.

         In addition to the Variable Rate Agreements, the Company has entered
         into Interest Rate Swaps pursuant to which it pays a variable rate
         based on LIBOR (6.4% at September 30, 1999) and receives a variable
         rate based on the Constant Maturity Treasury Index ("CMT") (6.1% at
         September 30, 1999) on a notional amount of $400 million through
         September 2000; and pays a variable rate based on LIBOR (6.3% at
         September 30, 1999) and receives a variable rate based on CMT (6.2% at
         September 30, 1999) on notional amounts of $95 million through February
         2000. During each of the seven months ended September 30, 1999, the two
         months ended February 28, 1999 and the nine months ended September 30,
         1998, the Company's net payments pursuant to such agreements were $1
         million. At September 30, 1999, the Company would be required to pay
         less than $1 million to terminate such Interest Rate Swaps.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The Company is exposed to credit losses for the periodic settlements of
         amounts due under the Interest Rate Swaps in the event of
         nonperformance by the other parties to the agreements. However, the
         Company does not anticipate that it will incur any material credit
         losses because it does not anticipate nonperformance by the
         counterparties. Further, the Company does not anticipate material
         near-term losses in future earnings, fair values or cash flows
         resulting from derivative financial instruments as of September 30,
         1999.

         months ended September 30, 1998, respectively, and are included in
         minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries in the
         accompanying consolidated financial statements.

         The aggregate fair value assigned to the Trust Preferred Securities in
         purchase accounting exceeded the aggregate recorded value at the date
         of the AT&T Merger by $160 million. Such excess is being amortized over
         the remaining 28 to 46 year terms of such securities.

(10)     Stockholders' Equity

         Treasury Stock and Common Stock Held by Subsidiaries, at Cost

         In conjunction with the AT&T Merger, Old TCI shares held in treasury
         and Old TCI shares held by subsidiaries were canceled. See note 2.

         General

         During 1997, Old TCI entered into certain equity swap facilities. Due
         to Old TCI's ability to issue shares to settle periodic price
         fluctuations and fees under the equity swap facilities, Old TCI
         recorded all amounts received or paid under these arrangements as
         increases or decreases, respectively, to equity. From February 1, 1999
         to March 5, 1999, Old TCI terminated all transactions under the equity
         swap facilities and the related swap agreements. In connection with the
         termination of such transactions, the Company received aggregate cash
         payments of $677 million. Such cash payments are reflected in Old TCI's
         consolidated financial statements for the two months ended February 28,
         1999.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         In July 1998, the Company entered into an equity swap transaction with
         a commercial bank, which provided the Company with the right but not
         the obligation to acquire 1,084,056 shares of TCI Group Series A Stock
         for approximately $45 million on or before April 19, 1999. During the
         two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company acquired the 1,084,056
         shares of TCI Group Series A Stock under the agreement. Such shares
         were used to satisfy the exchange requirements of a subsidiary's
         preferred stock. The $29 million excess of the amount paid for the TCI
         Group Series A Stock over the Company's minority interest in such
         subsidiary has been reflected as a decrease to stockholders' equity in
         the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the two months
         ended February 28, 1999.

(11)     Transactions with Related Parties

         On July 23, 1998, a merger in which TCG agreed to be acquired by AT&T,
         was consummated. As a result of such merger, TCI received in exchange
         for all of its interest in TCG, 70,429,248 shares of AT&T Common Stock.
         TCI recognized a $2.3 billion gain on such transaction during the third
         quarter of 1998 based on the difference between the carrying amount of
         TCI's interest in TCG and the fair value of the AT&T Common Stock
         received. Prior to the AT&T Merger, TCI had accounted for its ownership
         interest in AT&T Common Stock as an available-for-sale security. Such
         AT&T Common Stock was transferred from Liberty/Ventures Group to TCI
         Group in connection with the AT&T Merger. See note 2. In addition,
         immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, certain shares of Series F
         Preferred Stock were converted into shares of TCI Group Stock which, in
         turn, were converted into 215,755,850 shares of AT&T Common Stock. Such
         converted shares are recorded at Old TCI's historical cost basis. New
         TCI treats its investment in AT&T Common Stock as an investment in its
         parent. Accordingly, New TCI's investment in AT&T Common Stock is
         reflected as a reduction of TCI's equity. Old TCI recognized dividend
         income of $15.5 million on its AT&T Common Stock during the third
         quarter of 1998. The Company has not received any dividends on its
         investment in AT&T Common Stock subsequent to the AT&T Merger.

         The Company's non-interest bearing intercompany account with AT&T ($27
         million at September 30, 1999) is included in TCI's "Investment in
         AT&T" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

         Certain entities attributed to Liberty Media Group produce and/or
         distribute programming to the Company. Charges to the Company
         aggregated $121 million for the seven months ended September 30, 1999.
         Such amount is included in operating costs and expenses in the
         accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

         AT&T provides long distance service and allocates certain other
         administrative costs to the Company. During the seven months ended
         September 30, 1999, such amounts aggregated $29 million and are
         included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
         accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         NDTC leases transponder facilities to entities attributed to Liberty
         Media Group. Charges by NDTC for such arrangements were $14 million for
         the seven months ended September 30, 1999 and are included in revenue
         in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

         During the third quarter of 1999, AT&T utilized $495 million of TCI's
         net operating loss carryforwards to offset AT&T's current federal
         income tax liability. TCI did not receive any consideration for the
         utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, TCI
         has reflected AT&T's utilization of the net operating loss
         carryforwards as a decrease to "Additional paid-in capital" in the
         accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(12)     Transactions with Officers and Directors

         After the Company's stockholders voted to approve the terms of the AT&T
         Merger, on February 17, 1999, TCI's Board of Directors approved the
         payment by Liberty/Ventures Group of $1 million to each of two
         directors of the Company for their services on the Special Committee of
         TCI's Board of Directors in evaluating the AT&T Merger and the
         consideration to be received by the stockholders of the Company. In
         addition, Liberty/Ventures Group paid $10 million to a director and
         executive officer of TCI, immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, for his
         services in negotiating the merger agreement and completing the AT&T
         Merger.

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, a limited liability company owned by Dr.
         Malone, a director of the Company and TCI's former Chairman and Chief
         Executive Officer, acquired, from certain subsidiaries of Old TCI,
         working cattle ranches located in Wyoming in exchange for $17 million.
         The purchase price paid by such limited liability company was in the
         form of a 12-month note in the amount of $17 million having an interest
         rate of 7%. Such note is payable to an entity attributed to Liberty
         Media Group at any time without penalty and is personally guaranteed by
         Dr. Malone. No gain or loss was recognized by TCI on this transaction.

         As described more fully in note 7, the Company, on October 1, 1999,
         became the owner of all of the partnership interests in InterMedia IV.
         An individual who was a director and executive officer of TCI had a
         .001% special limited partnership interest in ICM IV, which in turn has
         a 1.19% limited partnership interest in InterMedia IV. Such
         individual's special limited partnership interest in ICM IV was created
         in August 1997 in connection with TCI's acquisition of all of the
         partnership interests (other than a .002% general partnership interest
         and a .001% special limited partnership interest) in ICM IV. In
         connection with the transaction described in note 7, such individual,
         by virtue of his .001% special limited partnership interest in ICM IV,
         participated in a profit sharing mechanism of InterMedia IV and
         received cash consideration of approximately $11 million based on the
         valuation of InterMedia IV.

         For additional transactions involving the Company's officers and
         directors, see notes 8 and 13.

                                                                     (continued)

(13)     Commitments and Contingencies

         The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992
         (the "1992 Cable Act") imposed certain rate regulations on the cable
         television industry. Under the 1992 Cable Act, all cable systems are
         subject to rate regulation, unless they face "effective competition,"
         as defined by the 1992 Cable Act and expanded in the Telecommunications
         act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), in their local franchise area.

         Although the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") has
         established regulations required by the 1992 Cable Act, local
         government units (commonly referred to as local franchising
         authorities) are primarily responsible for administering the regulation
         of a cable system's basic service tier ("BST"). The FCC itself directly
         administered rate regulation of any cable programming service tier
         ("CPST"). The FCC's authority to regulate CPST rates expired on March
         31, 1999. The FCC has taken the position that it will still adjudicate
         CPST complaints filed after this sunset date (but no later than 180
         days after the last CPST rate increase imposed prior to March 31,
         1999), and will strictly limit its review (and possible refund orders)
         to the time period predating the sunset date.

         Under the FCC's rate regulations, most cable systems were required to
         reduce their BST and CPST rates in 1993 and 1994, and have since had
         their rate increases governed by a complicated price structure that
         allows for the recovery of inflation and certain increased costs, as
         well as providing some incentive for expanding channel carriage.
         Operators also have the opportunity to bypass this "benchmark"
         regulatory structure in favor of the traditional "cost-of-service"
         regulation in cases where the latter methodology appears favorable.
         Premium cable services offered on a per-channel or per-program basis
         remain unregulated, as do affirmatively marketed packages consisting
         entirely of new programming product.

         The Company believes that it has complied in all material respects with
         the provisions of the 1992 Cable Act and the 1996 Act, including its
         rate setting provisions. If, as a result of the review process, a
         system cannot substantiate its rates, it could be required to
         retroactively reduce its rates to the appropriate benchmark and refund
         the excess portion of rates received. Any refunds of the excess portion
         of CPST rates would be retroactive to the date of complaint. Any
         refunds of the excess portion of BST or equipment rates would be
         retroactive to one year prior to the implementation of the rate
         reductions.


                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The Company is obligated and/or has guaranteed Liberty Media Group's
         obligation to pay fees for the rights to exhibit certain films that are
         released by various producers through 2017 (the "Film Licensing
         Obligations"). Based on customer levels at September 30, 1999, these
         agreements require minimum payments aggregating approximately $440
         million. The aggregate amount of the Film Licensing Obligations under
         these license agreements is not currently estimable because such amount
         is dependent upon the number of qualifying films released theatrically
         by certain motion picture studios as well as the domestic theatrical
         exhibition receipts upon the release of such qualifying films.
         Nevertheless, required aggregate payments under the Film Licensing
         Obligations could prove to be significant.

         The Company is a party to affiliation agreements with programming
         suppliers. Pursuant to certain of such agreements, the Company is
         committed to carry such suppliers' programming on its cable systems.
         Additionally, certain of such agreements provide for penalties and
         charges in the event the programming is not carried or not delivered to
         a contractually specified number of customers.

         The Company is committed to purchase billing services from a third
         party pursuant to three successive five-year agreements. Pursuant to
         such arrangement, the Company is obligated at September 30, 1999 to
         make minimum payments aggregating approximately $1.5 billion through
         2012. Such minimum payments are subject to inflation and other
         adjustments pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreements.

         The Company has guaranteed notes payable and other obligations of
         affiliated and other companies with outstanding balances of
         approximately $47 million at September 30, 1999. The Company also has
         agreed to take certain steps to support debt compliance with respect to
         obligations aggregating $1,720 million of certain cable television
         partnerships in which the Company has non-controlling ownership
         interests. See note 7. The Company also has guaranteed the performance
         of certain affiliates and other parties with respect to such parties'
         contractual and other obligations. Although there can be no assurance,
         management of the Company believes that it will not be required to meet
         its obligations under such guarantees, or if it is required to meet any
         of such obligations, that they will not be material to the Company.

         During 1999, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a contribution
         agreement ("Contribution Agreement") with certain shareholders of
         Phoenixstar, Inc. (formerly Primestar, Inc.) ("Phoenixstar") pursuant
         to which the Company would, to the extent it is relieved of $166
         million of contingent liabilities then owed to certain creditors of
         Phoenixstar and its subsidiaries, contribute up to $166 million to
         Phoenixstar to the extent necessary to satisfy liabilities of
         Phoenixstar. During the second quarter of 1999 and the fourth quarter
         of 1998, the Company recorded charges of $50 million and $90 million,
         respectively, to provide for the estimated losses that were expected to
         result from the Contribution Agreement. During 1999, the Company
         contributed approximately $116 million to Phoenixstar in partial
         satisfaction of its obligation. The Company's remaining obligation
         under the Contribution Agreement will expire in 2001. An individual who
         is a director of TCI is also the Chairman of the Board of TCI Satellite
         Entertainment, Inc. ("TSAT"). TSAT has an approximate 37% ownership
         interest in Phoenixstar.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         TCI has agreed to make fixed monthly payments to an entity attributed
         to Liberty Media Group pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The fixed
         annual commitments increase annually from $190 million in 1999 to $267
         million in 2003, and will increase with inflation through 2022. In
         addition, TCI is obligated to make minimum revenue payments through
         2017 and minimum license fee payments through 2007 aggregating $385
         million to an entity attributed to Liberty Media Group. Such minimum
         payments are subject to inflation and other adjustments pursuant to the
         terms of the underlying agreements.

         Effective as of December 16, 1997, NDTC on behalf of the Company and
         other cable operators that may be designated from time to time by NDTC
         ("Approved Purchasers"), entered into an agreement with GI to purchase
         a minimum of 6.5 million set-top devices during calendar years 1998,
         1999 and 2000 at an average price of $318 per set-top device. The 1998
         purchase commitment of 1.5 million set-top devices was met. The
         agreement with GI was amended in the third quarter of 1999 to change
         the remaining minimum purchase commitment for set-top devices to
         1,880,000 devices in 1999 and 2,500,000 devices in 2000. During the
         nine months ended September 30, 1999, approximately 1.4 million set-top
         devices had been purchased under the 1999 commitment. In connection
         with NDTC's purchase commitment, GI agreed to grant warrants to
         purchase its common stock proportional to the number of devices ordered
         by each organization. In connection with the AT&T Merger, such warrants
         were transferred to Liberty/Ventures Group in exchange for
         approximately $176 million in cash. To the extent such warrants do not
         vest because TCI fails to meet its purchase commitments, as amended,
         TCI is required to repay a proportional amount of such cash to Liberty
         Media Group. NDTC has the right to terminate the agreement if, among
         other reasons, GI fails to meet a material milestone designated in the
         agreement with respect to the development, testing and delivery of
         advanced digital set-top devices.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         On July 17, 1998, the Company acquired 21.4 million shares of common
         stock of GI in exchange for (i) certain of the assets of NDTC's set-top
         authorization business, (ii) the license of certain related software to
         GI, (iii) a $50 million promissory note from the Company to GI, and
         (iv) a nine-year revenue guarantee from the Company in favor of GI. In
         connection therewith, NDTC also entered into a services agreement
         pursuant to which it will provide certain postcontract services to GI's
         set-top authorization business. As a result of the deconsolidation of
         Liberty Media Group, the 21.4 million shares of GI common stock are no
         longer included in the Company's consolidated assets. The excess of the
         fair value of GI common stock received in 1998 over (i) the book value
         of certain assets transferred from NDTC to GI, and (ii) the present
         value of the promissory note due from the Company to GI, was deferred
         by the Company. As a result of the application of purchase accounting
         in connection with the AT&T Merger, the deferred amount related to the
         revenue guarantee was reduced to $61 million and the remaining deferred
         amount was reduced to $48 million.

         The Company has contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings and
         other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it
         is reasonably possible the Company may incur losses upon conclusion of
         such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made.
         In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any,
         which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be
         material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial
         statements.

(14)     Year 2000

         During the nine months ended September 30, 1999, the Company continued
         its enterprise-wide, comprehensive efforts to assess and remediate its
         computer systems and related software and equipment to verify that such
         systems, software and equipment recognize, process and store
         information in the year 2000 and thereafter. The Company's year 2000
         remediation efforts include an assessment of its most critical systems,
         such as customer service and billing systems, headends and other cable
         plant systems that support the Company's programming services, business
         support operations, and other equipment and facilities. The Company
         also continued its efforts to verify the year 2000 readiness of its
         significant suppliers and vendors and continued to communicate with
         significant business partners and affiliates to assess such partners'
         and affiliates' year 2000 status.

                                                                     (continued)

         The Company has a year 2000 Program Management Office (the "PMO") to
         organize and manage its year 2000 efforts. The PMO is responsible for
         overseeing the process and standards of the Company's year 2000
         efforts, controlling data, and reporting on the Company's year 2000
         efforts. At September 30, 1999, the PMO was comprised of a 133-member,
         full-time staff, accountable to executive management of the Company.


         During the nine months ended September 30, 1999, the Company continued
         its survey of third-party vendors and suppliers whose systems, services
         or products are important to the Company's operations, and whose year
         2000 readiness is critical to continued provision of the Company's
         cable service. The Company has examined the public disclosures
         regarding the year 2000 readiness status made by vendors of critical
         systems products utilized by the Company (such as addressable
         controllers, accounting systems and other critical hardware and
         software), and the public disclosures regarding the year 2000 readiness
         status made by critical suppliers (such as utilities, banking, and
         similar critical operational services). Verification of the survey
         results may include, as deemed necessary, conducting functionality
         tests, reviewing vendors' and suppliers' test data, scripts and
         certifications, engaging in regular conferences with vendors' and
         suppliers' year 2000 teams, or re-examining public disclosures for
         changes in status. The Company generally has required any new vendors
         to provide assurances that their products and services are year 2000
         ready. For those critical vendors that may not be year 2000 ready by
         year end, contingency plans will be implemented.

         Significant market value is associated with the Company's investments
         in certain public and private corporations, partnerships and other
         businesses. Accordingly, the Company is monitoring the public
         disclosure of such publicly-held business entities, including CSC and
         @Home, to determine their year 2000 readiness. In addition, the Company
         has surveyed and monitored the year 2000 status of certain
         privately-held business entities in which the Company has significant
         investments.

         Year 2000 expenses and capital expenditures incurred during the seven
         months ended September 30, 1999 were $47 million and $18 million,
         respectively. Year 2000 expenses and capital expenditures incurred
         during the two months ended February 28, 1999 were $11 million and $2
         million, respectively. Year 2000 expenses and capital expenditures for
         the seven months ended September 30, 1999 are exclusive of costs
         attributable to Liberty Media Group, which was deconsolidated as of
         March 1, 1999. See note 2. Management of the Company currently
         estimates the remaining costs, exclusive of future costs attributable
         to the assessment and remediation of year 2000 issues associated with
         Liberty Media Group, to be not less than $25 million, bringing the
         total estimated cost associated with the Company's year 2000
         remediation efforts to be not less than $117 million (including $36
         million for replacement of noncompliant information technology
         systems). Also included in this estimate is $7 million in future
         payments to be made pursuant to unfulfilled executory contracts or
         commitments with vendors for year 2000 remediation services.

                                                                     (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

         The failure to correct a material year 2000 problem could result in an
         interruption or failure of certain important business operations. There
         can be no assurance that the Company's systems or the systems of other
         companies on which the Company relies will be converted in time or that
         any such failure to convert by the Company or other companies will not
         have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
         operations or cash flows.

(15)     Information about the Company's Operating Segments

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, Old TCI had two reportable segments: domestic
         cable and communications services and domestic programming services.
         Domestic cable and communications services receive video, audio and
         data signals from various sources, and amplify and distribute the
         signals by coaxial cable and optical fiber to the premises of customers
         who pay a fee for the service. Domestic programming services are
         produced, acquired, and distributed, through all available formats and
         media, branded entertainment and informational programming and
         software, including multimedia products, delivered in both analog and
         digital form. Old TCI's domestic cable and communications services
         business and assets were included in TCI Group, and Old TCI's domestic
         programming business and assets were included in Old Liberty Group. Old
         TCI's principal international businesses and assets and Old TCI's
         remaining non-cable and non-programming domestic businesses and assets
         were included in TCI Ventures Group.

         As described in note 2, immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, Old TCI
         purchased certain assets from Liberty/Ventures Group and the net assets
         attributed to Liberty Media Group were deconsolidated. As a result of
         these transactions, domestic cable and communications services is the
         only reportable segment of New TCI. Accordingly, segment information is
         not provided for New TCI.

         The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
         in the summary of significant accounting policies. Old TCI evaluated
         performance based on a measure of "Operating Cash Flow" (defined by the
         Company as operating income before depreciation, amortization, other
         non-cash items, year 2000 costs, AT&T merger and integration costs and
         stock compensation). Operating Cash Flow is a measure of value and
         borrowing capacity within the cable television industry and is not
         intended to be a substitute for cash flow provided by operating
         activities, or a measure of performance prepared in accordance with
         generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be relied upon
         as such.

         Old TCI generally accounted for intersegment sales and transfers as if
         the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current
         market prices.

         Old TCI's reportable segments were strategic business units that
         offered different products and services. They were managed separately
         because each segment required different technology and marketing
         strategies.

                                                                     (continued)
