AMR CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1.The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles  for interim financial  information  and  the
  instructions  to  Form  10-Q  and  Article  10  of  Regulation  S-X.
  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
  required  by  generally accepted accounting principles for  complete
  financial statements.  In the opinion of management, these financial
  statements  contain all adjustments, consisting of normal  recurring
  accruals, the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and
  the  initiatives announced on August 13, 2002 referred to below, and
  asset  impairment and other charges necessary to present fairly  the
  financial  position, results of operations and cash  flows  for  the
  periods indicated. The Company's 2002 results continue to be adversely
  impacted by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting
  effect  on  the  economy  and the air transportation  industry.   In
  addition,  on April 9, 2001, Trans World Airlines LLC  (TWA  LLC,  a
  wholly  owned subsidiary of AMR Corporation) purchased substantially
  all  of  the  assets and assumed certain liabilities of Trans  World
  Airlines, Inc. (TWA).  Accordingly, the operating results of TWA LLC
  are  included  in the accompanying condensed consolidated  financial
  statements for the three and nine month periods ended September  30,
  2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC were included only  for
  the period April 10, 2001 through September 30, 2001.  When utilized
  in this report, all references to American Airlines, Inc. include the
  operations of TWA LLC since April 10, 2001 (collectively, American).
  Certain  amounts  have been reclassified to conform  with  the  2002
  presentation.  Results of operations for the periods presented herein
  are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the entire
  year.   For further information, refer to the consolidated financial
  statements and footnotes thereto included in the AMR Corporation (AMR
  or the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
  31, 2001 ("2001 Form 10-K").

2.On August 13, 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives
  to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and
  enhance productivity.  These initiatives include, among other things,
  de-peaking of the Company's Dallas/Fort Worth International  Airport
  hub; gradually phasing out operation of its Fokker aircraft fleet by
  2005;  and  reducing  capacity in the fourth quarter  of  2002.   In
  addition,  the Company announced that it would reduce  an  estimated
  7,000  jobs by March 2003 to realign its workforce with the  planned
  capacity reductions, fleet simplification, and hub restructurings.

  On  September 11, 2001, two American Airlines aircraft were hijacked
  and  destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New
  York  City and the Pentagon in northern Virginia.  On the same  day,
  two  United  Air  Lines  aircraft were also  hijacked  and  used  in
  terrorist  attacks.  In addition to the loss of life  on  board  the
  aircraft, these attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries
  to  persons on the ground and massive property damage.  In  response
  to  those  terrorist  attacks, the Federal  Aviation  Administration
  issued   a  federal  ground  stop  order  on  September  11,   2001,
  prohibiting  all  flights to, from, and within  the  United  States.
  Airports  did  not  reopen  until September  13,  2001  (except  for
  Washington  Reagan Airport, which was partially reopened on  October
  4,  2001).   The Company was able to operate only a portion  of  its
  scheduled  flights for several days thereafter.  When  flights  were
  permitted  to resume, passenger traffic and yields on the  Company's
  flights  were significantly lower than prior to the attacks.   As  a
  result,  following these attacks, the Company reduced its  operating
  schedule  to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew  prior
  to  September  11, 2001.  In addition, as a result of  its  schedule
  reduction  and the sharp fall off in passenger traffic, the  Company
  eliminated approximately 20,000 jobs.

  On  September  22,  2001, President Bush signed  into  law  the  Air
  Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act).  Under
  the airline compensation provisions of the Act, each air carrier was
  entitled  to  receive the lesser of: (i) its direct and  incremental
  losses  for  the period September 11, 2001 to December 31,  2001  or
  (ii)  its  proportional available seat mile  allocation  of  the  $5
  billion  compensation available under the Act.  The Company received
  its final compensation from the U.S. Government under the Act during
  the  third  quarter of 2002.  The Company received a total  of  $866
  million from the U.S. Government under the Act.  For the nine months
  ended    September   30,  2002  and  2001,  the   Company   recorded
  approximately  $10  million  and  $809  million,  respectively,   as
  compensation under the Act, which is included in Special  charges  -
  net  of  U.S.  Government  grant, on the  accompanying  consolidated
  statements of operations.

  Aircraft Charges

  In  connection  with the Company's August 13, 2002 announcement  and
  related revisions to its fleet plan to accelerate the retirement  of
  its  owned  Fokker 100, Saab 340, and ATR 42 aircraft,  the  Company
  determined  that  these  aircraft are impaired  under  Statement  of
  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  144  "Accounting   for   the
  Impairment  or  Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"  (SFAS  144).   As  a
  result of this determination, during the third quarter of 2002,  the
  Company  recorded  an asset impairment charge of approximately  $370
  million  reflecting  the  diminution in  the  fair  value  of  these
  aircraft  and  related rotables, the write-down of  certain  related
  inventory  to  realizable value, and the accrual  of  certain  other
  costs.   Cash outlays are estimated to be approximately $12  million
  and will extend through 2008.

  Furthermore,  the  Company  accelerated  the  retirement   of   nine
  operating  leased Boeing 767-300 aircraft to the fourth  quarter  of
  2002  (previously scheduled to be retired by May 2003), and its four
  operating  leased Fokker 100 aircraft to 2004 (previously  scheduled
  to  be  retired by 2010).  As a result, during the third quarter  of
  2002,  the  Company recorded a charge of approximately $189  million
  related primarily to future lease commitments on these aircraft past
  the dates they will be removed from service, lease return costs, the
  write-down  of excess Boeing 767-300 related inventory and  rotables
  to  realizable value, and the accrual of certain other costs.   Cash
  outlays  are  estimated to be approximately $159  million  and  will
  occur over the remaining lease terms, which extend through 2014.

  In  addition,  during  the third quarter of 2002,  as  a  result  of
  revisions  to  its  fleet plan, the Company  recorded  a  charge  of
  approximately $99 million related primarily to contract cancellation
  costs   and   other   costs   related   to   discontinued   aircraft
  modifications.

  During  the  second  quarter  of  2001,  in  conjunction  with   the
  acquisition  of certain assets from TWA, coupled with  revisions  to
  the  Company's fleet plan to accelerate the retirement dates of  its
  owned  Fokker  100,  Saab  340  and ATR  42  aircraft,  the  Company
  determined  these aircraft were impaired.  As a result,  during  the
  second  quarter  of 2001, the Company recorded an  asset  impairment
  charge  of approximately $685 million relating to the write-down  of
  the  carrying value of these aircraft and related rotables to  their
  estimated fair values.

  Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2001, following the  events
  of  September  11,  2001 and decisions by other carriers  to  ground
  their Fokker 100 fleets, the Company determined that its Fokker 100,
  Saab  340,  and  ATR 42 aircraft were further impaired.   Therefore,
  during the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional
  charge  of  approximately $423 million reflecting the diminution  in
  the estimated fair value of these aircraft and related rotables.

  In  September  2001, the Company announced that it would  accelerate
  the retirement of its remaining 50 owned Boeing 727-200 aircraft  to
  early 2002, ground all McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (DC9) aircraft by  the
  end  of October 2001, and immediately ground eight McDonnell Douglas
  MD-80  (MD80)  aircraft.  As a result, during the third  quarter  of
  2001,  the  Company recorded a charge of approximately  $73  million
  related  primarily to future lease commitments on the DC9  and  MD80
  operating  leased  aircraft past the dates they  were  removed  from
  service, lease return and storage costs, and the write-down  of  one
  owned  MD80  aircraft  to its estimated fair  value.   Cash  outlays
  during 2002 related to the accelerated retirement of these operating
  leased DC9 and MD80 aircraft total $17 million.

  In   determining  the  asset  impairment  charges  described  above,
  management  estimated the undiscounted future cash  flows  utilizing
  models used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling decisions.
  In  determining  the  fair  value of  these  aircraft,  the  Company
  considered  outside  third party appraisals and recent  transactions
  involving  sales  of similar aircraft.  In 2002,  the  Company  also
  considered  internal valuation models in determining the fair  value
  of  these  aircraft,  and with respect to the Fokker  100  aircraft,
  incorporated  the  fact that with this grounding, no  major  airline
  will  operate  this  fleet type.  As a result of the  write-down  of
  these  aircraft  to fair value, as well as the acceleration  of  the
  retirement  dates  and changes in salvage values,  depreciation  and
  amortization will decrease from the amounts recognized in the  third
  quarter of 2002 by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis.

  Facility exit costs

  In response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Company
  announced that it would discontinue service at Dallas Love Field and
  discontinue  or  reduce  service on  several  of  its  international
  routes.   In  addition, the Company announced  it  would  close  six
  Admiral's   Clubs,  five  airport  Platinum  Service   Centers   and
  approximately  105  off-airport Travel Centers  in  37  cities,  all
  effective  September 28, 2001.  As a result of these  announcements,
  during the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $61 million
  charge  related primarily to future lease commitments and the write-
  off of leasehold improvements and fixed assets.  Cash outlays during
  2002 related to these accruals total $3 million.

  Employee charges

  On  August  13, 2002, the Company announced that it would reduce  an
  estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003 to realign its workforce with the
  planned   capacity   reductions,  fleet  simplification,   and   hub
  restructurings.  This reduction in workforce, which will affect  all
  work  groups  (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics,  fleet  service
  clerks,  agents,  management and support staff personnel),  will  be
  accomplished  through various measures, including limited  voluntary
  programs, leaves of absence, part-time work schedules, furloughs  in
  accordance  with  collective bargaining  agreements,  and  permanent
  layoffs.  As a result, during the third quarter of 2002, the Company
  recorded  an employee charge of approximately $57 million  primarily
  related   to   voluntary  programs  in  accordance  with  collective
  bargaining  agreements  with its pilot  and  flight  attendant  work
  groups.  Cash outlays for the employee charge will be incurred  over
  a  period of up to twelve months and will approximate the amount  of
  the  charge  recorded.  In addition, the Company  expects  to  incur
  additional  employee charges related to this reduction in  workforce
  in the fourth quarter of 2002.

  On September 19, 2001, the Company announced that it would be forced
  to reduce its workforce by approximately 20,000 jobs across all work
  groups.  This reduction in workforce, which the Company accomplished
  through  various measures, including leaves of absence, job sharing,
  elimination   of  open  positions,  furloughs  in  accordance   with
  collective  bargaining agreements, and permanent  layoffs,  resulted
  from  the  September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks  and  the  Company's
  subsequent  reduction of its operating schedule by approximately  20
  percent.  In connection therewith, during the third quarter of 2001,
  the  Company  recorded  a charge of approximately  $55  million  for
  employee  termination  benefits.   Cash  outlays  for  the  employee
  charges  were  incurred substantially during the fourth  quarter  of
  2001.

3.Effective  January  1, 2002, the Company  adopted  Statement  of
  Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
  Assets"  (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires the Company to test goodwill
  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets (for AMR, route  acquisition
  costs)  for impairment rather than amortize them.  During the  first
  quarter  of 2002, the Company completed its impairment analysis  for
  route acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142.  The analysis did
  not result in an impairment charge.  During the third quarter of 2002,
  the  Company completed its impairment analysis related to  its  $1.4
  billion  of  goodwill and determined the Company's  entire  goodwill
  balance was impaired.  In arriving at this conclusion, the Company's
  net  book value was determined to be in excess of the Company's fair
  value at January 1, 2002, using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes
  of  the  fair value determination.  The Company determined its  fair
  value  as  of  January  1,  2002, using various  valuation  methods,
  ultimately utilizing market capitalization as the primary indicator of
  fair  value.  As a result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash
  charge, effective January 1, 2002, of $988 million ($6.36 per share,
  net  of  a  tax benefit of $363 million) to write-off all  of  AMR's
  goodwill.  This charge is nonoperational in nature and is reflected as
  a  cumulative  effect  of  accounting  change  in  the  consolidated
  statements of operations.  This charge does not affect the Company's
  financial covenants in any of its credit agreements.

  The  following table provides information relating to the  Company's
  amortized intangible assets as of September 30, 2002 (in millions):

                                               Accumulated    Net Book
                                    Cost       Amortization    Value
    Amortized intangible assets:
     Airport operating rights      $  516        $    173    $    343
     Gate lease rights                204              77         127
     Total                         $  720        $    250    $    470

  Airport  operating and gate lease rights are being  amortized  on  a
  straight-line  basis over 25 years to a zero residual  value.    For
  the  three  and  nine month periods ended September  30,  2002,  the
  Company  recorded amortization expense of approximately  $7  million
  and  $22  million, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
  The  Company  expects  to  record  annual  amortization  expense  of
  approximately $29 million in each of the next five years related  to
  these intangible assets.

  The  pro forma effect of discontinuing amortization of goodwill  and
  route  acquisition costs under SFAS 142 - assuming the  Company  had
  adopted this standard as of January 1, 2001 - results in an adjusted
  net  loss  of  approximately $404 million, or $2.62 per  share,  and
  approximately  $936 million, or $6.07 per share,  respectively,  for
  the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2001.

  In   addition,  effective  January  1,  2001,  the  Company  adopted
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for
  Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities",  as  amended  (SFAS
  133).  SFAS 133 required the Company to recognize all derivatives on
  the  balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are  not  hedges
  are  adjusted to fair value through income.  If the derivative is  a
  hedge,  depending on the nature of the hedge, changes  in  the  fair
  value  of derivatives are either offset against the change  in  fair
  value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
  earnings  or  recognized  in other comprehensive  income  until  the
  hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of a
  derivative's  change  in  fair value is  immediately  recognized  in
  earnings.   The adoption of SFAS 133 did not result in a  cumulative
  effect  adjustment being recorded to net income for  the  change  in
  accounting.   However, the Company recorded a transition  adjustment
  of approximately $64 million in Accumulated other comprehensive loss
  in the first quarter of 2001.

4.Accumulated  depreciation  of owned equipment  and  property  at
  September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001 was $8.2 billion  and  $8.9
  billion,  respectively.  Accumulated amortization of  equipment  and
  property under capital leases at September 30, 2002 and December 31,
  2001 was approximately $945 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.

  Receivables,  net at September 30, 2002 includes a  receivable  from
  the  U.S.  Government of $567 million as a result of a provision  in
  the   recently  passed  economic  stimulus  package  regarding   net
  operating loss carrybacks.

5.The  following  table provides unaudited pro forma  consolidated
  results of operations, assuming the acquisition of TWA had occurred as
  of January 1, 2001 (in millions, except per share amounts):

                                     Nine Months Ended
                                     September 30, 2001

  Net loss                           $     (971)
  Loss per share                     $    (6.31)

  The unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have been
  prepared  for  comparative purposes only.   These  amounts  are  not
  indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had  the
  transaction  actually been consummated on the date  indicated  above
  and  are  not  indicative of the consolidated results of  operations
  which may occur in the future.

6.As  discussed  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial
  statements included in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade County
  (the  County)  is  currently investigating and  remediating  various
  environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and
  funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various  cost
  recovery  methods.   American  and AMR  Eagle  have  been  named  as
  potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA.
  During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against
  17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past
  and future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
  Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to
  the  17  defendants  named in the lawsuit, 243  other  agencies  and
  companies  were  also  named  as  PRPs  and  contributors   to   the
  contamination.   American's and AMR Eagle's portion of  the  cleanup
  costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
  the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the
  proportion  of the cost that will ultimately be recovered  from  the
  responsible  parties, and uncertainties regarding the  environmental
  agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial activities  and
  the nature of that supervision.

  In  addition,  the  Company is subject to  environmental  issues  at
  various   other  airport  and  non-airport  locations.    Management
  believes,  after considering a number of factors, that the  ultimate
  disposition  of  these  environmental  issues  is  not  expected  to
  materially  affect  the Company's consolidated  financial  position,
  results   of  operations  or  cash  flows.   Amounts  recorded   for
  environmental issues are based on the Company's current  assessments
  of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could increase or decrease
  as these assessments change.

7.As of September 30, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire
  the following aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 11 Boeing 777-200ERs,  9
  Boeing 767-300ERs, 102 Embraer regional jets and 20 Bombardier  CRJ-
  700s.  Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through
  2010.   Payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately
  $209 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.1 billion in 2003, $696
  million in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $3.3 billion in 2005
  through 2010.  These commitments and cash flows reflect agreements the
  Company  has  with  Boeing  to defer 34 of  its  2003  through  2005
  deliveries to 2007 and beyond.

  In addition to these deferrals, Boeing has agreed to provide backstop
  financing for certain aircraft deliveries in 2003. In return,
  American has agreed to grant Boeing a security interest in certain
  advance payments previously made and in certain rights under
  the aircraft purchase agreement between American and Boeing.

  Approximately $740 million of special facility revenue bonds, issued by
  local municipalities to purchase equipment and improve facilities that are
  leased to American under operating lease agreements, contain mandatory tender
  provisions that require American to repurchase the bonds at various times
  through  2008, including $200 million in November 2003. These special
  facility revenue bonds are guaranteed by American, AMR or both. Although
  American has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance
  that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. Any payments to
  purchase bonds that are not remarketed would be considered prepaid
  facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments.

8.In  March  2002,  the Regional Airports Improvement  Corporation
  issued   facilities  sublease  revenue  bonds  at  the  Los  Angeles
  International Airport to provide reimbursement to American for certain
  facility  construction costs.  The Company has  recorded  the  total
  amount of the issuance of $284 million (net of $13 million discount)
  as long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of
  September 30, 2002.  These obligations bear interest at fixed rates,
  with  an  average  effective rate of 7.88 percent, and  mature  over
  various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2024.  The Company
  has received approximately $237 million in reimbursements of facility
  construction costs and other items through September 30, 2002.   The
  remaining $47 million of the bond issuance proceeds not yet received,
  classified  as  Other  assets on the condensed consolidated  balance
  sheets, are held by the trustee and will be available to the Company
  in the future.

  In July 2002, the New York City Industrial Development Agency issued
  facilities   sublease  revenue  bonds  at  the   John   F.   Kennedy
  International  Airport  to  provide reimbursement  to  American  for
  certain  facility construction costs.  The Company has recorded  the
  total  amount  of the issuance of $475 million (net of  $25  million
  discount)  as  long-term debt on the condensed consolidated  balance
  sheets as of September 30, 2002.  These obligations bear interest at
  fixed  rates,  with an average effective rate of 8.97  percent,  and
  mature  in  2012  and 2028.  The Company has received  approximately
  $372  million in reimbursements of facility construction  costs  and
  other  items through September 30, 2002.  The remaining $103 million
  of  the bond issuance proceeds not yet received, classified as Other
  assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, are held by the
  trustee and will be available to the Company in the future.

  In   September  2002,  American  issued  $617  million  of  enhanced
  equipment  trust  certificates secured by  aircraft,  with  interest
  based  on  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a  spread  and
  maturities over various periods, with a final maturity in 2007.

  In  addition, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2002,
  American  and  AMR Eagle borrowed approximately $915  million  under
  various  debt  agreements which are secured by aircraft.   Effective
  interest  rates on these agreements are fixed or variable  based  on
  LIBOR  plus a spread and mature over various periods of time through
  2017.   At September 30, 2002, the effective interest rates on these
  debt  agreements  and  the  enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates
  described above ranged up to 3.89 percent.

  Including  the  impact  of  the  above transactions,  the  Company's
  maturities   of  total  long-term  debt  (including   sinking   fund
  requirements) for the next five years are: remainder of 2002 -  $106
  million;  2003  -  $562 million; 2004 - $471 million;  2005  -  $1.3
  billion; 2006 - $1.0 billion.

9.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
  sale securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
  the  fair  value  of certain derivative financial  instruments  that
  qualify  for hedge accounting in comprehensive loss.  For the  three
  months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive loss was $897
  million  and $511 million, respectively.  In addition, for the  nine
  months  ended  September 30, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive  loss  was
  $2,881 million and $990 million, respectively.  The difference between
  net loss and comprehensive loss is due primarily to the accounting for
  the  Company's derivative financial instruments under SFAS  133.  In
  addition, the nine month period ended September 30, 2001 includes the
  cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 133.

  During the second quarter of 2002, the Company discontinued entering
  into  new  foreign  exchange currency put  option  agreements.   All

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2002 and 2001

Summary    AMR Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss during  the
third  quarter  of  2002  was $924 million, or  $5.93  per  share,  as
compared  to  a net loss of $414 million, or $2.68 per share  for  the
same period in 2001.  AMR's operating loss of $1,321 million increased
by  $763  million compared to the same period in 2001.  The  Company's
2002  results  continue to be adversely impacted by the September  11,
2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the
air   transportation  industry.   On  August  13,  2002,  the  Company
announced  a  series  of  initiatives  to  reduce  its  costs,  reduce
capacity,  simplify  its  aircraft fleet,  and  enhance  productivity.
These  initiatives  include, among other  things,  de-peaking  of  the
Company's  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Airport  hub;  gradually
phasing  out operation of its Fokker aircraft fleet; reducing capacity
in the fourth quarter of 2002; and reducing an estimated 7,000 jobs by
March  2003.   As  a  result, during the third quarter  of  2002,  the
Company  recorded  approximately $718 million of charges  relating  to
this  announcement and related revisions to the Company's fleet  plan.
On  September  11, 2001, two of American's aircraft were hijacked  and
destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in  New  York
City  and  the  Pentagon in northern Virginia.  On the same  day,  two
United  Air  Lines aircraft were also hijacked and used  in  terrorist
attacks.   In response to the terrorist attacks, the Federal  Aviation
Administration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop order  on  September
11,  2001,  prohibiting all flights to, from, and  within  the  United
States.  Airports did not reopen until September 13, 2001 (except  for
Washington  Reagan National Airport, which was partially  reopened  on
October  4, 2001).  The Company was able to operate only a portion  of
its  scheduled flights for several days thereafter. When flights  were
permitted  to  resume, passenger traffic and yields on  the  Company's
flights  were  significantly lower than prior to the  attacks.   As  a
result,  the  Company  announced that it would  reduce  its  operating
schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior  to
September 11, 2001.  Therefore, during the third quarter of 2001,  the
Company recorded approximately $632 million of charges related to  the
events  of September 11, 2001.  In addition, during the third  quarter
of  2001, the Company recorded an $809 million benefit recognized  for
the   reimbursement   from   the  U.S.  Government   under   the   Air
Transportation  Safety and System Stabilization Act  (the  Act).   For
additional information related to the August 13, 2002 announcement and
the  events  of  September  11, 2001, see  Note  2  in  the  condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Although  traffic  has continued to increase on significantly  reduced
capacity  since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's  third
quarter 2002 revenues were down quarter-over-quarter.  In addition  to
the  residual effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue
to  be  negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely  in
business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the Company's
network and reduced fares.  In total, the Company's revenues decreased
$322 million, or 6.7 percent, in the third quarter of 2002 as compared
to the same period last year.  American's passenger revenues decreased
by  6.9 percent, or $277 million in the third quarter of 2002 from the
same  period in 2001.  American's domestic revenue per available  seat
mile  (RASM)  decreased  6.2 percent, to 7.79  cents,  on  a  capacity
decrease  of .7 percent, to 32.9 billion available seat miles  (ASMs).
International  RASM  decreased to 9.15 cents, or  1.5  percent,  on  a
capacity decrease of 5.5 percent.  The decrease in international  RASM
was due to a 9.3 percent decrease in Latin American RASM, offset by  a
6.6  percent  and 5.6 percent increase in Pacific and  European  RASM,
respectively.  The decrease in international capacity was driven by  a
17.4  percent and 9.3 percent reduction in Pacific and European  ASMs,
respectively,  slightly  offset by a 1.0  percent  increase  in  Latin
American ASMs,

AMR  Eagle's passenger revenues increased 1.2 percent, or $4  million.
AMR  Eagle's  traffic increased 11.2 percent while  capacity  remained
flat at approximately 1.7 billion ASMs.

Cargo  revenues decreased $19 million, or 12.0 percent, primarily  due
to the same reasons as noted above.

Other  revenues decreased 10.4 percent, or $30 million, due  primarily
to  decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs  for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel
service charges.

                                    -11-

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The  Company's  operating  expenses increased  8.2  percent,  or  $441
million.   American's  cost per ASM decreased  6.0  percent  to  10.38
cents, excluding the impact of the 2002 and 2001 Special charges - net
of  U.S. Government grant.  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased 0.6
percent,  or  $12  million reflecting (i) a decrease  in  the  average
number  of  equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher  salaries,
and  (ii)  increases  in the Company's pension  and  health  insurance
costs,   the  latter  reflecting  rapidly  rising  medical  care   and
prescription  drug  costs.   Aircraft  fuel  expense  decreased   10.2
percent,  or  $79 million, due primarily to a 6.3 percent decrease  in
the  Company's  fuel  consumption and a 4.1 percent  decrease  in  the
Company's  average  price per gallon of fuel.  Maintenance,  materials
and repairs decreased 13.0 percent, or $43 million, due primarily to a
decrease  in  airframe and engine volumes at the Company's maintenance
bases.   Food  service  decreased 9.6 percent,  or  $20  million,  due
primarily  to the Company's reduced operating schedule and  change  in
level  of food service.  Commissions to agents decreased 48.3 percent,
or  $100 million, due primarily to a 6.2 percent decrease in passenger
revenues  and commission structure changes implemented in March  2002.
Special  charges - net of U.S. Government grant for the third  quarter
2002  include:  (i)  approximately $658 million  related  to  aircraft
charges,  including  a  charge  of $370 million  related  to  aircraft
impairments, (ii) approximately $57 million in employee charges and $3
million  in  other charges, and (iii) a $10 million benefit recognized
for  the  reimbursement  from  the  U.S.  Government  under  the  Act.
Comparatively,   the   third  quarter  2001  amounts   include:    (i)
approximately  $496  million  related  to  aircraft  impairments   and
groundings, (ii) $61 million in facility exit costs, approximately $55
million  in employee charges, $20 million in other charges, and  (iii)
an $809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S.
Government under the Act.  For additional information, see Note  2  in
the  condensed  consolidated  financial statements.   Other  operating
expenses  decreased 13.6 percent, or $132 million,  due  primarily  to
decreases  in  contract  maintenance work that American  performs  for
other  airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs,  credit
card  and  booking  fees, advertising and promotion  costs,  and  data
processing  expenses, which were partially offset by higher  insurance
and security costs.

Other  income  (expense) increased $50 million due  primarily  to  the
following:   Interest expense increased $49 million, or 40.2  percent,
resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's long-term debt.
Interest  capitalized  decreased $14 million,  or  37.8  percent,  due
primarily  to  a  decrease in purchase deposits for flight  equipment.
Miscellaneous-net increased $11 million, due primarily to earnings  on
equity investments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2002 and 2001

Summary   AMR's loss before cumulative effect of accounting change for
the  nine months ended September 30, 2002 was $2.0 billion, or  $12.83
per  share,  as compared to a net loss of $964 million, or  $6.26  per
share, for the same period in 2001.  AMR's operating loss for the nine
months  ended  September  30, 2002 was $2.7 billion,  compared  to  an
operating  loss  of  $1.3 billion for the same period  in  2001.   The
Company's  2002  results  continue to be  adversely  impacted  by  the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect  on  the
economy and the air transportation industry.  On April 9, 2001,  Trans
World  Airlines  LLC  (TWA  LLC, a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  AMR)
purchased  substantially  all  of  the  assets  and  assumed   certain
liabilities  of  Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).   Accordingly,  the
operating  results  of  TWA  LLC  are  included  in  the  accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month  period
ended September 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC  were
included  only  for  the period April 10, 2001 through  September  30,
2001.    All  references  to  American  Airlines,  Inc.  include   the
operations  of TWA LLC since April 10, 2001 (collectively,  American).
On  August 13, 2002, the Company announced a series of initiatives  to
reduce  its  costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet,  and
enhance  productivity.  These initiatives include, among other things,
de-peaking  of  the Company's Dallas/Fort Worth International  Airport
hub;  gradually  phasing out operation of its Fokker  aircraft  fleet;
reducing  capacity  in  the fourth quarter of 2002;  and  reducing  an
estimated  7,000  jobs by March 2003.  As a result, during  2002,  the
Company  recorded  approximately $718 million of charges  relating  to
this  announcement and related revisions to the Company's fleet  plan.
In  addition, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $988
million  (net  of  tax), effective January 1,  2002,  reflected  as  a
cumulative  effect  of accounting change, to write-off  all  of  AMR's
goodwill.   On  September  11, 2001, two of American's  aircraft  were
hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The World Trade  Center
in  New York City and the Pentagon in northern Virginia.  On the  same
day,  two  United Air Lines aircraft were also hijacked  and  used  in
terrorist attacks.  In response to the terrorist attacks, the  Federal
Aviation  Administration (FAA) issued a federal ground stop  order  on
September  11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within  the
United  States.   Airports  did not reopen until  September  13,  2001
(except  for  Washington Reagan National Airport, which was  partially
reopened on October 4, 2001).  The Company was able to operate only  a
portion  of  its  scheduled flights for several days thereafter.  When
flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yields on  the
Company's flights were significantly lower than prior to the  attacks.
As  a result, the Company announced that it would reduce its operating
schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior  to
September  11,  2001.  Therefore, the Company's 2001  results  include
approximately  $632  million  of charges  related  to  the  events  of
September  11, 2001.  In addition, the Company's 2001 results  include
an $809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S.
Government  under  the  Act, a $685 million  asset  impairment  charge
(recorded in the second quarter of 2001) and a $45 million dollar gain
(recorded  in  the second quarter of 2001) from the  settlement  of  a
legal  matter  related  to the Company's 1999 labor  disruption.   For
additional  information related to the August 13,  2002  announcement,
the  events  of September 11, 2001, and the second quarter 2001  asset
impairment charge, see Note 2 in the condensed consolidated  financial
statements.

Although  traffic  has continued to increase on significantly  reduced
capacity  since  the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's  2002
revenues were down significantly year-over-year.  In addition  to  the
residual  effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue  to
be  negatively  impacted  by the economic slowdown,  seen  largely  in
business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the Company's
network and reduced fares.  In total, the Company's revenues decreased
$2,050  million, or 13.5 percent, in 2002 versus the  same  period  in
2001.   American's  passenger revenues decreased by 12.9  percent,  or
$1,626  million  in  2002  as compared to the  same  period  in  2001.
American's domestic RASM decreased 11.1 percent, to 8.30 cents,  on  a
capacity decrease of 0.5 percent, to 94.3 billion ASMs.  International
RASM  decreased to 8.84 cents, or 5.5 percent, on a capacity  decrease
of  11.1 percent.  The decrease in international RASM was due to a 9.8
percent and 3.0 percent decrease in Latin American and European  RASM,
respectively,  slightly offset by a 6.0 percent  increase  in  Pacific
RASM.   The  decrease in international capacity was driven by  a  29.9
percent,  13.1 percent and 5.2 percent reduction in Pacific,  European
and Latin American ASMs, respectively.

AMR  Eagle's  passenger  revenues  decreased  10.0  percent,  or  $110
million.   AMR  Eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent  while  capacity
decreased  2.1  percent, to approximately 4.8 billion ASMs.   As  with
American,  the decrease in AMR Eagle's revenues was due  primarily  to
the  continued impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks  and
the economic slowdown.

                                  -14-

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Cargo revenues decreased $109 million, or 20.8 percent, primarily  due
to the same reasons as noted above.

Other  revenues decreased 22.2 percent, or $205 million, due primarily
to  decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs  for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel
service charges.

The   Company's   operating  expenses  decreased   4.4   percent,   or
approximately $721 million.  American's cost per ASM decreased by  1.7
percent  to 10.80 cents, excluding the impact of 2002 and 2001 special
charges  - net of U.S. Government grant.  Wages, salaries and benefits
increased  5.4 percent, or $322 million, reflecting (i) a decrease  in
the  average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher
salaries,  and  (ii)  increases in the Company's  pension  and  health
insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and
prescription  drug  costs.   Aircraft  fuel  expense  decreased   19.1
percent, or $445 million, due primarily to an 11.9 percent decrease in
the  Company's  average price per gallon of fuel  and  a  6.5  percent
decrease   in  the  Company's  fuel  consumption.   Aircraft   rentals
increased  $46 million, or 7.6 percent, due primarily the addition  of
TWA  aircraft.  Food service decreased 11.8 percent, or  $72  million,
due  primarily to the Company's reduced operating schedule and  change
in  level  of  food  service.  Commissions to  agents  decreased  38.8
percent, or $268 million, due primarily to a 12.7 percent decrease  in
passenger  revenues  and commission structure changes  implemented  in
March  2002. Special charges - net of U.S. Government grant  for  2002
include:  (i) approximately $658 million related to aircraft  charges,
including  a  charge of $370 million related to aircraft  impairments,
(ii)  approximately $57 million in employee charges and $3 million  in
other  charges,  and  (iii) a $10 million benefit recognized  for  the
reimbursement  from the U.S. Government under the Act.  Comparatively,
the  2001 amounts include:  (i) a $685 million asset impairment charge
recorded  in  the second quarter of 2001 related to the write-down  of
the carrying value of its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and
related   rotables;   (ii)  third  quarter  2001   charges   including
approximately  $496  million  related  to  aircraft  impairments   and
groundings, (ii) $61 million in facility exit costs, approximately $55
million  in employee charges, $20 million in other charges, and  (iii)
an $809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the U.S.
Government under the Act.  For additional information, see Note  2  in
the  condensed  consolidated  financial statements.   Other  operating
expenses  decreased 14.8 percent, or $428 million,  due  primarily  to
decreases  in  contract  maintenance work that American  performs  for
other  airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs,  credit
card  and  booking  fees, advertising and promotion  costs,  and  data
processing  expenses, which were partially offset by higher  insurance
and security costs.

Other  income  (expense) increased $217 million due to the  following:
Interest  income decreased 32.5 percent, or $26 million, due primarily
to  decreases  in  interest rates.  Interest  expense  increased  $128
million, or 34.3 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the
Company's long-term debt.  Interest capitalized decreased $49 million,
or  42.2 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for
flight   equipment.   Miscellaneous-net  decreased  $14  million   due
primarily to a $45 million gain recorded during the second quarter  of
2001  from  the settlement of a legal matter related to the  Company's
1999  labor disruption and the write-down of certain investments  held
by the Company during the first quarter of 2001.

The  effective tax rate for the nine months ended September  30,  2002
was  impacted  by a $57 million charge resulting from a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changes  the  period  for
carrybacks  of  net operating losses (NOLs).  This change  allows  the
Company  to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather  than
two years under the existing law, allowing the Company to more quickly
recover  its NOLs.  The extended NOL carryback did however, result  in
the  displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.   These
credits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the
Company, resulting in this charge.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net  cash used by operating activities in the nine month period  ended
September 30, 2002 was $472 million, compared to net cash provided  by
operating  activities of $1.3 billion for the same period in  2001,  a
decrease  of  $1.8  billion,  due primarily  to  an  increase  in  the
Company's  net  loss.   Included in net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities during the first nine months of 2002 was approximately $658
million received by the Company as a result of the utilization of  its
2001  NOL's.  Capital expenditures for the first nine months  of  2002
were  $1.5 billion, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing  757-
200s, three Boeing 777-200ERs, 22 Embraer 140s and four Bombardier CRJ-
700  aircraft.   These  capital expenditures were  financed  primarily
through secured mortgage and debt agreements.  Proceeds from the  sale
of  equipment  and  property  of  $193 million  include  the  proceeds
received  upon delivery of three McDonnell Douglas MD-11  aircraft  to
FedEx.

As  of September 30, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire  the
following aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 11 Boeing 777-200ERs, 9 Boeing
767-300ERs,  102  Embraer  regional jets and 20  Bombardier  CRJ-700s.
Deliveries  of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through  2010.
Payments  for  these  aircraft are expected to be  approximately  $209
million  during  the  remainder of 2002, $1.1 billion  in  2003,  $696
million in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $3.3 billion in 2005
through 2010.  These commitments and cash flows reflect agreements the
Company  has  with  Boeing  to  defer 34  of  its  2003  through  2005
deliveries to 2007 and beyond.

In addition to these deferrals, Boeing has agreed to provide backstop
financing for certain aircraft deliveries in 2003. In return, American
has agreed to grant Boeing a security interest in certain advance payments
previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement
between American and Boeing.

In  June 2002, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of  AMR
and  American,  and  the  credit ratings of a number  of  other  major
airlines.   The  long-term credit ratings of  AMR  and  American  were
removed from Standard & Poor's Credit Watch with negative implications
and  were  given a negative outlook.  Furthermore, in September  2002,
Moody's  downgraded  the  unsecured credit ratings  of  both  AMR  and
American  and  has  a  negative  outlook  on  these  ratings.    These
reductions  in  the  Company's  credit  ratings  have  increased   its
borrowing  costs.   Any additional reductions in AMR's  or  American's
credit  ratings could further increase its borrowing costs  and  might
limit the availability of future financing.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)

In  the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001, the Company has
raised  substantial amounts of funding to finance capital  commitments
and  day-to-day operations.  The Company expects that it will continue
to  need  to raise significant additional financing in the  future  to
cover its liquidity needs.  In addition to the Company's approximately
$2.8  billion  in cash and short-term investments as of September  30,
2002, the Company has available a variety of future financing sources,
including,  but not limited to: (i) additional secured aircraft  debt,
(ii) sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft
and  real estate, (iii) the recovery of a $567 million receivable from
the  U.S.  Government  related to a provision in the  recently  passed
economic  stimulus package regarding NOL carrybacks,  (iv)  tax-exempt
borrowings  for  airport  facilities,  (v)  securitization  of  future
operating receipts, (vi) unsecured borrowings, and (vii) the potential
sale  of certain non-core assets.  No assurance can be given that  any
of  these financing sources will be available or will be available  on
terms  acceptable  to the Company.  However, the Company  believes  it
will meet its current financing needs.

During 2002, American issued $617 million of enhanced equipment  trust
certificates  secured  by  aircraft, with  interest  based  on  London
Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR) plus a spread  and  maturities  over
various  periods, with a final maturity in 2007.  Upon the  completion
of  this financing, a $1 billion credit facility, established in  late
2001  to  serve  as  a bridge for this financing, expired  undrawn  on
September  30,  2002.   Also  during 2002, the  Company  entered  into
approximately  $915  million  of various debt  agreements  secured  by
aircraft.   Effective rates on these agreements are fixed or  variable
based  on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of  time
through 2017.   At September 30, 2002, the effective interest rates on
these  debt  agreements and the enhanced equipment trust  certificates
described above ranged up to 3.89 percent.

During  March  2002,  the  Regional Airports  Improvement  Corporation
issued   facilities  sublease  revenue  bonds  at  the   Los   Angeles
International Airport to provide reimbursement to American for certain
facility  construction  costs.  The Company  has  recorded  the  total
amount  of  the issuance of $284 million (net of $13 million discount)
as  long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as  of
September  30, 2002.  These obligations bear interest at fixed  rates,
with  an  average  effective rate of 7.88  percent,  and  mature  over
various  periods of time, with a final maturity in 2024.  The  Company
has  received approximately $237 million in reimbursements of facility
construction  costs and other items through September 30,  2002.   The
remaining  $47 million of the bond issuance proceeds not yet received,
classified  as  Other  assets  on the condensed  consolidated  balance
sheets,  are held by the trustee and will be available to the  Company
in  the  future.   In  addition,  in July  2002,  the  New  York  City
Industrial Development Agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds
at  the John F. Kennedy International Airport to provide reimbursement
to  American for certain facility construction costs.  The Company has
recorded the total amount of the issuance of $475 million (net of  $25
million  discount)  as  long-term debt on the  condensed  consolidated
balance  sheets  as  of  September 30, 2002.  These  obligations  bear
interest  at  fixed  rates, with an average  effective  rate  of  8.97
percent,  and  mature  in  2012 and 2028.  The  Company  has  received
approximately $372 million in reimbursements of facility  construction
costs and other items through September 30, 2002.  The remaining  $103
million of the bond issuance proceeds not yet received, classified  as
Other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, are held by
the trustee and will be available to the Company in the future.

Pursuant  to  the Act, the Government made available to air  carriers,
subject to certain conditions, up to $10 billion in federal government
guarantees  of  certain  loans.   American  did  not  seek  such  loan
guarantees.

OTHER INFORMATION

As  a  result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
significantly  reduced  the  maximum  amount  of  insurance   coverage
available  to  commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other
than  employees  or  passengers  for claims  resulting  from  acts  of
terrorism,  war or similar events (war-risk coverage).   At  the  same
time,  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage  as
well  as  for  aviation insurance in general.  Pursuant  to  authority
granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-
risk  insurance  until December 15, 2002 with a third party  liability
policy  to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers.
In  the  event  the commercial insurance carriers reduce  further  the
amount  of  insurance  coverage available to the  Company  or  further
significantly  increase  the cost of aviation  insurance,  or  if  the
Government fails to renew the war-risk insurance that it provides, the
Company's   operations  and/or  financial  position  and  results   of
operations would be materially adversely affected.

                             -17-

OTHER INFORMATION (Continued)

As  discussed  in  the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, a  provision  in  the
current Allied Pilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number of
ASMs  and block hours flown under American's two letter marketing code
(AA) by American's regional carrier partners when American pilots  are
on  furlough  (the  ASM  cap).   As  AMR  Eagle  continues  to  accept
previously  ordered regional jets, this ASM cap was reached  in  2002,
necessitating  actions to insure compliance with the ASM  cap.   These
actions as well as additional potential actions in respect to the  ASM
cap  are  discussed  in the Company's 2001 Form  10-K.   In  addition,
American   has   removed   its  code  from   some   flights   of   the
AmericanConnection  carriers,  which  are  independent  carriers  that
provide feed to American's St. Louis hub, and will continue to  remove
its  codes  from  additional  flights of the  carriers  as  warranted.
American believes that the combination of these actions will  enable
it  to  continue  to  comply with this ASM cap through  2002  and  for
sometime beyond.

In  addition, another provision in the current APA contract limits the
total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats flown under  the
American  code by American's regional carrier partners to 67 aircraft.
Similar  to  the  above, as AMR Eagle continues to  accept  previously
ordered  Bombardier CRJ aircraft, this cap would be reached  in  early
2003.   In  order to ensure American remains in compliance  with  this
provision, AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in principle to  dispose
of  14  Embraer  145  aircraft.  Ultimately, these airplanes  will  be
acquired  by  Trans  States  Airlines, an AmericanConnection  carrier.
Trans States Airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter
airline  code  (AX) and expects to deploy these aircraft  at  its  St.
Louis  hub  where it feeds American.  The potential transaction  still
requires the consent of certain third parties, including the companies
financing these aircraft, and is subject to the negotiation  of  final
documentation.

The  Company  believes that if actual investment returns  continue  at
current levels and interest rates remain unchanged through the rest of
the  year, it will be required to record a significant minimum pension
liability as of December 31, 2002. The minimum pension liability would
reflect  the  amount  that  the  pension  plans'  accumulated  benefit
obligation  exceeds the plans' assets in excess of amounts  previously
accrued  for  pension costs.  A large portion of the charge  would  be
recorded  as  a reduction to stockholders' equity, as a  component  of
accumulated  comprehensive  loss, net of any  available  tax  benefit.
Although the exact amount of the charge to stockholders' equity is not
known at this time, it will likely exceed $1 billion (before tax).  As
of  December 31, 2001, the Company's minimum pension liability reduced
stockholders' equity by approximately $172 million (before tax).  This
charge to stockholders' equity will not affect the Company's financial
covenants in any of its credit agreements.

Furthermore,  given  the  Company's  current  financial  situation,  a
deferred   tax  asset  valuation  allowance  may  be  necessary.    In
determining  whether  a  deferred tax  asset  valuation  allowance  is
necessary,  the Company considers whether it is more likely  than  not
that some portion or all of the Company's deferred tax assets will not
be  realized.  Although a valuation allowance is not necessary  as  of
September  30,  2002, due to the existence of available  deferred  tax
liabilities, it is likely that beginning late in the fourth quarter of
2002  or early in the first quarter of 2003 a valuation allowance will
be necessary.  In effect the Company would not be able to recognize  a
tax  benefit  of  losses incurred, resulting in  larger  reported  net
losses.

                                -18-

FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK

Capacity  for American is expected to be up approximately six  percent
in  the  fourth quarter of 2002 compared to last year's fourth quarter
levels,  and  down 13 percent from the fourth quarter  of  2000.
AMR  Eagle's fourth quarter capacity will be up about ten percent from
last  year's levels, and down one percent from the fourth  quarter  of
2000.  For the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company expects traffic  to
be  up  approximately thirteen percent from last year's fourth quarter
levels, and down 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2000.  Pressure
to  reduce costs will continue, although the Company will continue  to
see  higher benefit and security costs, increased insurance  premiums,
and  greater interest expense. In addition, the Company expects to see
a 23 percent increase in fuel prices as compared to the fourth quarter
of  2001  and  a continued decline in commission expense  due  to  the
commission  changes implemented earlier in 2002.  In total, American's
unit  costs, excluding special charges, for the fourth quarter of 2002
are  expected to be down approximately three percent from last  year's
fourth  quarter level.  Notwithstanding the expected decrease in  unit
costs  however, given the revenue pressures expected to continue  into
the  fourth quarter and the current level of fuel prices, the  Company
expects  to incur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, likely  in
excess of the third quarter loss excluding special charges.

In  response to these financial challenges, the Company is  continuing
its  comprehensive  review of its business to better  align  its  cost
structure  with  the current revenue environment, aimed  at  improving
productivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs.

In  addition, on August 13, 2002, the Company announced  a  series  of
short-  and  long-  term  initiatives  to  reduce  its  costs,  reduce
capacity,  simplify  its  aircraft fleet,  and  enhance  productivity.
These  initiatives  include, among other  things,  de-peaking  of  the
Company's  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hub (following  the
de-peaking  of  its  Chicago hub in April 2002) by scheduling  flights
into  and  out of the hub more continuously, with flights  spread  out
more  evenly through the day; gradually phasing out operation  of  its
Fokker  aircraft fleet by 2005; and reducing capacity  in  the  fourth
quarter of 2002.  By de-peaking its Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago hubs
the  Company  believes  it can more productively  use  its  employees,
gates, and aircraft.  In addition, the Company announced that it would
reduce  an estimated 7,000 jobs by March 2003 to realign its workforce
with  the planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification,  and  hub
restructurings.  American subsequently announced that it expects  full
year  capacity  for  2003 to be down about three  percent  from  2002,
giving  effect  to the capacity reduction described  above.   Although
American  expects these initiatives to improve efficiency  and  reduce
operating costs, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will
be successful or sufficient.

OTHER RISK FACTORS

As  a  result  of weak domestic and international economic conditions,
reduced  fares, and the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001,  the
airline  industry as a whole suffered substantial losses in 2001,  and
is  expected to suffer significant losses for 2002.  Many airlines, in
addition  to American, have announced reductions in capacity,  service
and workforce in response to the industry-wide reductions in passenger
demand and yields.  In addition, since September 11, 2001 several  air
carriers  have  sought to reorganize under Chapter 11  of  the  United
States  Bankruptcy Code, including US Airways, Inc. (US Airways),  the
seventh  largest  domestic  air carrier.  More  recently,  United  Air
Lines,  Inc.  (United), the second largest domestic air  carrier,  has
publicly  stated  that, if it is not able to realize substantial  cost
savings from its current cost savings initiatives, it may be forced to
reorganize under the Bankruptcy Code.  Successful completion  of  such
reorganizations   could   present  American  with   competitors   with
significantly  lower operating costs derived from labor,  supply,  and
financing   contracts  renegotiated  under  the  protection   of   the
Bankruptcy Code.  In addition, historically, air carriers involved  in
reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in  order
to  maintain  cash  flows and to enhance continued  customer  loyalty.
Such  fare  discounting could further lower yields for  all  carriers,
including  American.   Further, the market  value  of  aircraft  would
likely  be  negatively impacted if a number of air carriers, including
US Airways and United, seek to reduce capacity by eliminating aircraft
from their fleets.

Moreover,  the  increased  threat  of  U.S.  military  involvement  in
overseas  operations  (including,  for  example,  the  hostilities  in
Afghanistan  and  the threat of war with Iraq) could have  a  material
adverse  impact  on  the  Company's business, financial  position
(including access to capital markets) and results of operations and on
the airline industry in general.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between  American
and  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay money  to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   The  plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The  Company
intends  to  vigorously  defend  the lawsuit.   Although  the  Company
believes  that  the  litigation is without  merit,  an  adverse  court
decision could impose restrictions on the Company's relationships with
travel agencies which restrictions could have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of
the  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,
Inc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,
Kansas.  The  lawsuit alleges that American unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
Dallas/Fort  Worth  International Airport (DFW) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching these  new
competitors'  fares.   The  Department  of  Justice  seeks  to  enjoin
American  from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to  impose
restraints  on  American to remedy the alleged  effects  of  its  past
conduct.   On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Kansas granted American's motion for summary judgment.  On June 26,
2001,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  appealed  the  granting  of
American's motion for summary judgment, and on September 23, 2002, the
parties presented oral arguments to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals,
which  has not yet issued its decision.  The Company intends to defend
the  lawsuit  vigorously.   A final adverse  court  decision  imposing
restrictions on the Company's ability to respond to competitors  would
have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits
were  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (King
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR
Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et
al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).
Collectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying
to  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors' fares.   Two  of  the
suits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from
1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
Department of Justice (see above description). As a result, to date no
class has been certified. The Company intends to defend these lawsuits
vigorously. One or more final adverse court decisions imposing restrictions
on the Company's ability to respond to competitors or awarding  substantial
money damages would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

On  May  17,  2002,  the named plaintiffs in Hall, et  al.  v.  United
Airlines, et al., pending in the United States District Court for  the
Eastern  District  of  North  Carolina,  filed  an  amended  complaint
alleging that between 1995 and the present, American and over 15 other
defendant  airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based
travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The  court
granted  class action certification to the plaintiff on September  17,
2002,  defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United
States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any
time   from   October  1,  1997,  to  the  present,  issued   tickets,
miscellaneous change orders, or prepaid ticket advices for  travel  on
any  of the defendant airlines.  American is vigorously defending  the
lawsuit.   Trial  is  set for April 29, 2003.  A final  adverse  court
decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the  Company's commission policies or practices would have an  adverse
impact on the Company.

On April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed Albany Travel Co., et al.
v.  Orbitz, LLC, et al., in the United States District Court  for  the
Central  District  of California against American, United  Air  Lines,
Delta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other
defendants:  (i)  conspired to prevent travel agents  from  acting  as
effective  competitors  in  the distribution  of  airline  tickets  to
passengers  in  violation  of  Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act;  and
(ii)  conspired to monopolize the distribution of common  carrier  air
travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2
of the Sherman Act.  The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide
class of travel agents, but no class has yet been certified.  American
is  vigorously defending the lawsuit, which  is set for trial July  9,
2003.  A  final  adverse  court decision  awarding  substantial  money
damages   or   placing  restrictions  on  the  Company's  distribution
practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  April  25,  2002, a collection of 38 Quebec travel agencies  filed
Voyages  Montambault  (1989),  Inc.  v.  International  Air  Transport
Association,  et al., seeking a declaratory judgment of  the  Superior
Court  in  Montreal,  Canada  that  American  and  the  other  airline
defendants owe a "fair and reasonable commission" to the agencies, and
that  American  and  the  other  airline defendants  breached  alleged
contracts with these agencies by adopting policies of not paying  base
commissions.   The  defendants  are the  International  Air  Transport
Association,  the  Air  Transport Association, Air  Canada,  American,
America  West,  Delta  Air Lines, Grupo TACA,  Northwest  Airlines/KLM
Airlines,  United  Air  Lines, US Airways, and  Continental  Airlines.
American  is  vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse  court
decision  granting  declaratory relief could  expose  the  Company  to
claims  for substantial money damages or force the Company to  pay
agency commissions, either of which would have an  adverse impact
on the Company.

On May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in Always Travel, et. al. v. Air
Canada,  et.  al.,  pending  in the Federal  Court  of  Canada,  Trial
Division,  Montreal, filed a statement of claim alleging that  between
1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines, and  the
International   Air   Transport  Association   conspired   to   reduce
commissions  paid  to  Canada-based  travel  agents  in  violation  of
Section  45  of  the Competition Act of Canada.  The named  plaintiffs
seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no class  has
yet been certified.  American is vigorously defending the lawsuit.   A
final  adverse  court decision awarding substantial money  damages  or
placing  restrictions on the Company's commission policies would  have
an adverse impact on the Company.

On  August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American
Airlines,  Inc.  in the United States District Court for  the  Central
District  of  California,  Western Division  (All  World  Professional
Travel  Services,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.).   The  lawsuit
alleges  that  requiring  travel  agencies  to  pay  debit  memos  for
refunding  tickets after September 11, 2001:  (1) breaches  the  Agent
Reporting  Agreement between American and plaintiff;  (2)  constitutes
unjust  enrichment;  and  (3) violates the  Racketeer  Influenced  and
Corrupt  Organizations  Act of 1970 (RICO).  The  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
moneys  to  American for an "administrative service charge,"  "penalty
fee," or other fee for processing refunds on behalf of passengers  who
were unable to use their tickets in the days immediately following the
tragedies  on  September  11, 2001.  The  plaintiff  seeks  to  enjoin
American  from collecting the debit memos and to recover  the  amounts
paid  for  the debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees,  and
costs.    The  Company  intends  to  vigorously  defend  the  lawsuit.
Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit, an
adverse  court  decision could impose restrictions  on  the  Company's
relationships  with travel agencies which restrictions could  have  an
adverse impact on the Company.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

On   August  19,  2002,  a  U.S.  travel  agency  filed  Power  Travel
International, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.,  in  New  York
state  court against American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air  Lines,
JetBlue  Airways,  United Air Lines, and Northwest Airlines,  alleging
that  American and the other defendants breached their contracts  with
the  agency  as well as the duty of good faith and fair  dealing  when
these carriers at various times reduced base commissions to zero.  The
plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no
class has yet been certified. The plaintiff dismissed JetBlue from the
lawsuit,  and  the  remaining defendants removed the  lawsuit  to  the
United  States District Court for the Southern District of  New  York.
American  is vigorously defending the lawsuit.  A final adverse  court
decision awarding substantial money damages or forcing the Company  to
pay agency commissions would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and
remediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami
International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through
landing  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,
Inc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties
(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of
2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future
cleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,
Inc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17
defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were
also  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American's
and  AMR  Eagle's  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably
estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that
will  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and
uncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will
ultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that
supervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.
