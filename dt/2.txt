                                  PART II 
                          RULE 12B-25 (B) AND (C) 
  
      If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort
 or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the
 following should be completed.  (Check box if appropriate.) 
  
      (a)  The reason described in detail in Part III of this form could not
           be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense; 
      (b)  The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report
           on Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion thereof will
           be filed on or before the 15th day following the prescribed due
           date; or the subject 
 ( )       quarterly report or transition report on Form 10-Q, or portion
           thereof  will be filed on or before the fifth calendar day
           following the prescribed due date; and 
      (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 12b-
           25 (c) has been attached if applicable. 
  

                                  PART III 
                                 NARRATIVE 
  
      State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-
 F, 10-Q, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be filed
 within the prescribed time period. 
  
      As previously announced, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
 of Sunbeam Corporation (the "Company") has determined that the Company will
 be required to restate its audited financial statements for 1997 and
 possibly 1996, as well as its unaudited financial statements for the first
 quarter of 1998.  This conclusion was reached by the Audit Committee based
 on information presented to it by the Company's outside auditor, Arthur
 Andersen LLP, and the accounting firm assisting the Audit Committee,
 Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
  
           The Company believes that it will be in a position to issue
 restated financial statements by the end of September 1998.  Until that
 time, the Company will not be in a position to report its financial results
 for the second quarter of 1998 and, accordingly, will be unable to file its
 second quarter Form 10-Q with the Commission.  
  

  
                                  PART IV 
                             OTHER INFORMATION 
  
      (1)  Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
 notification: 
  
 Janet G. Kelley                      (561)              243-2127    
   (Name)                           (Area Code)      (Telephone Number) 
  
      (2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or
 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the
 Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such
 shorter period that the registrant was required to file such report (s)
 been filed?  If the answer is no, identify report(s).    
  
                                                         (X)  Yes   ( )  No 
  
      (3)  Is it  anticipated that any significant change in results of
 operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
 reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report
 or portion thereof? 
                                                         (X)  Yes   ( )  No 
  
      If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
 narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why
 a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made. 
  
           The restatements will involve adjustments that are expected to be
 material in the aggregate for 1997 and possibly for 1996, as well as for
 the first quarter of 1998.  The Company is working with Arthur Andersen LLP
 and Deloitte & Touche LLP to review the Company's financial records and
 quantify the adjustments.  Until this review is completed, however, no
 estimate can be made of the extent of any restatement that may be required
 with respect to the second quarter of 1997.
