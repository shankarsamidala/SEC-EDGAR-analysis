                                   PART I
                           REGISTRANT INFORMATION

 Full name of registrant: Sunbeam Corporation


 Former name, if applicable: Not Applicable


 Address of principal executive office: 2381 Executive Center Drive


 City, state and zip code: Boca Raton, Florida  33431


                                  PART II
                          RULE 12b-25 (b) AND (c)

      If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort
 or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the
 following should be completed.  (Check box if appropriate.)


      (a)  The reason described in detail in Part III of this form could not
           be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;

 (X)  (b)  The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report
           on Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion thereof will
           be filed on or before the 15th day following the prescribed due
           date; or the subject quarterly report or transition report on
           Form 10-Q, or portion thereof will be filed on or before the
           fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date; and

      (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 12b-
           25(c) has been attached, if applicable.


                                  PART III
                                 NARRATIVE

      State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-
 F, 10-Q, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be filed
 within the prescribed time period.

      On November 8, 1999, Sunbeam Corporation (the "Company") completed and
 filed amendments to its Annual Report Form 10-K for fiscal year 1998, its
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1999
 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
 1999.  In addition, the Company filed with the Commission an amendment to
 its Registration Statement on Form S-1 on November 4, 1999.  The Commission
 declared the Registration Statement effective on November 8, 1999.  Both
 the Company's management and its auditors allocated substantial resources
 to these efforts.

      As a result of the significant time and effort expended by the
 Company's management and its outside auditors in connection with the
 preparation of the filings referred to above, the Company will not be in a
 position to file timely its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
 quarter ended September 30, 1999.   Nevertheless, the Company does intend
 to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter no later
 than the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date, as
 contemplated by Rule 12b-25(b)(2) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934, as amended.


                                  PART IV
                             OTHER INFORMATION

      (1)  Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
 notification:

 Steven R. Isko, Esq.               (561)                912-4100
      (Name)                     (Area Code)         (Telephone Number)


      (2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or
 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the
 Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such
 shorter period that the registrant was required to file such report(s)
 been filed?  If the answer is no, identify report(s).

                                                          (X)  Yes   ( ) No

      (3)  Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of
 operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
 reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report
 or portion thereof?

                                                          ( ) Yes   (X)  No

      If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
 narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why
 a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

                              Sunbeam Corporation
                  (Name of Registrant as Specified in Charter)


 Has caused this notification to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned
 thereunto duly authorized.
