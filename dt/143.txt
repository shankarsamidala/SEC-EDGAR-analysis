       NOTES   TO   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS   (UNAUDITED)


1.  The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three month periods
ended March 31, 2000 and 1999 were not audited.  However, in Management's
opinion, the information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the periods presented.  Management believes all
adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the
1999 audited financial statements in Bethlehem's Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Presentation of certain
amounts in the prior year have been revised to be consistent with the current
year.

3.  On May 29, 1998, Bethlehem acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Lukens Inc.  The aggregate purchase price of $560.6 million comprises cash of
$327.8 million, the issuance of 15.1 million shares of Bethlehem common stock
valued at $184.8 million, and transaction related costs of $48.0 million.
Transaction related costs of $3.6 million were paid during the first quarter of
1999.  The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
Lukens' results are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
date of acquisition.  The stainless and distribution businesses were acquired
with the purchase of Lukens Inc.  and are being accounted for as discontinued
operations.  Income or losses from these operations are not included in
Bethlehem's operating results.  In the first quarter of 2000, Bethlehem
completed the planned divestiture of the stainless and distribution businesses
acquired in the Lukens purchase for amounts essentially equal to $316 million.
The net assets of these operations are shown separately on the balance sheet
and consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and working capital.

                         MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
           ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


REVIEW OF RESULTS:

FIRST QUARTER 2000 - FIRST QUARTER 1999


         Bethlehem reported net income of $3 million for the first
quarter of 2000, compared with net losses of $38 million for the
fourth quarter of 1999 and $26 million for the first quarter of 1999.
After deducting preferred dividend requirements, this is a loss of
$.05 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2000, compared
with losses of $.37 and $.28 per share for the fourth quarter and
first quarter of 1999.

OPERATING RESULTS

         Our income from operations was $19 million for the first
quarter of 2000, compared with losses from operations of $35 million
for the fourth quarter of 1999 and $20 million for the first quarter
of 1999.  Our first quarter 2000 operating results improved from a
year ago reflecting primarily higher shipments and lower costs,
partially offset by a less favorable product mix.  Our steel prices,
on a constant mix basis, were slightly lower than a year ago.

         Our income from operations for the first quarter of 2000
improved by $54 million from a loss of $35 million for the fourth
quarter of 1999 primarily due to higher realized prices and shipments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

         At March 31, 2000, our total liquidity, comprising cash, cash
equivalents and funds available under our bank credit arrangements,
totaled $384 million, compared with $334 million at December 31, 1999.

         For the first quarter of 2000, cash provided from continuing
operating activities was $136 million, compared with a cash use of $6
million for the first quarter of 1999.  Principal uses of cash during
the first quarter of 2000 included capital expenditures of $53 million
and debt repayments of $28 million.  Major uses of cash for 2000 are
expected to be capital expenditures of about $250 million and public
debt maturity payments of about $45 million.

         We expect to maintain an adequate level of liquidity during
2000 with cash provided from operations, available funds under our
bank arrangements, improvements in working capital, primarily
inventory reductions, and asset sales.

DIVIDENDS

         On April 26, 2000, our Board of Directors declared dividends
of $1.25 per share on Bethlehem's $5.00 Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, $0.625 per share on Bethlehem's $2.50 Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock and $0.875 per share on Bethlehem's $3.50
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, each payable June 10, 2000, to
holders of record on May 10, 2000.  No dividend was declared on
Bethlehem's Common Stock.

OUTLOOK

         The U.S.  economy continues on a path of solid growth driven
by strong consumer spending, low unemployment and business investment.
Steel demand remains strong, led by record automotive sales and
production.  We currently believe that domestic industry shipments
will be about 108 million tons this year.  This compares with the
estimated 105 million tons shipped in 1999.

         During the remainder of 2000, we expect to start up three new
operations at Sparrows Point -- a new continuous cold mill complex, a
pulverized coal injection facility and a wide-slab caster.

         Improving steel market conditions have allowed us to realize
some further modest price restoration, and we expect that trend to
continue due to our continuing strong order entry and shipment levels.

         Although overall steel market conditions have been improving
because of continued strong domestic and improving global demand,
import levels are too high because unfair trade continues.  Our
various trade efforts have achieved some success in restoring fair
trade in certain steel products, and we will continue to take all
appropriate legal, governmental affairs and public affairs actions to
achieve fair trade in steel.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         This release contains forward-looking statements.  Our use of
the words "expect", "believe", "intent", "should", "plan" and similar
words are intended to identify these statements as forward-looking.
In accordance with the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, reference is made to "Item 1 - Business - Forward-
Looking Statements" of Bethlehem's 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K and
to "Cautionary Statement" of Bethlehem's Registration Statement on
Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April
24, 1998 for important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected.

                     PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

         Bethlehem, in the ordinary course of its business, is the
subject of various pending or threatened legal actions involving
governmental agencies or private interests.  Bethlehem believes that
any ultimate liability arising from these actions should not have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position at
March 31, 2000.

         Bethlehem does not have any material developments in legal
proceedings to report for the first quarter of 2000.
