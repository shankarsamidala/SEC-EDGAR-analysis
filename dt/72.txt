1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
  Organization and Basis of Presentation
 
     American Pad & Paper Company (the "Company") is a holding company, which
conducts its operations through American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.
("AP&P Delaware") and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
 
     The financial statements of the Company present the accounts and operations
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Notepad Funding Corporation, a
special purpose corporation used in connection with an accounts receivable based
credit facility. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
 
  Business
 
     The Company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of paper-based office
products in North America. The Company operates in one business segment,
converting paper into office products, and offers a broad assortment of products
through two complementary divisions: Ampad (writing pads, file folders, retail
envelopes, and other paper-based office products) and Williamhouse (business
envelopes and seasonal greeting cards). The Company's products are distributed
through large mass merchant retailers, office product superstores, warehouse
clubs, major contract stationers, office products wholesalers, paper merchants,
and independent dealers.
 
  Interim Financial Information
 
     The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited. Certain
information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted, although the Company believes the disclosures included herein are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1997.
 
     The accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of the Company's financial position at June 30, 1998 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the three month and six month
periods ended June 30, 1998 and 1997. The results of operations for the interim
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
the full fiscal year.
 
  American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.
 
     The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, AP&P Delaware, is the issuer of 13%
Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). Terms of the Notes require, among other
matters, that AP&P Delaware provide annual audited and quarterly unaudited
financial statements to the holders of the notes. There are no material
differences between the financial statements of the Company and those of AP&P
Delaware. The composition of AP&P Delaware's stockholder's equity at June 30,
1998 consists of one hundred shares of $0.01 par value common stock, paid in
capital of $202,368 and an accumulated deficit of $159,713 and, in total, is
equal to the stockholders' equity of the Company.

7. BORROWINGS
 
     In February 1998, the Company and its banking group agreed to an increase
in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
million for a period of one year. After such time, the level of debt available
under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. In December 1997,
February 1998 and April 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were
also modified as of the end of 1997 and for a period ending in February 1999.
Unless approved by the banking group, the Company will be restricted to $15.0
million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and will be restricted from any
acquisitions. The interest rate incurred by the Company will vary each quarter
in 1998 depending on the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio at the
beginning of each quarter. The Company paid fees and expenses of $1.4 million to
its banking group and lawyers in connection with the amendments to the credit
agreement.
 
     As a result of the second quarter loss, the Company was in default of
certain EBITDA covenants at June 30, 1998. On June 30, 1998 the Company obtained
an amendment to its credit agreement waiving all defaults of its financial
covenants through July 31, 1998. On July 24, 1998, the waiver was extended
through September 30, 1998. The extension also amended the credit agreement to
provide for: changes in the voting procedures necessary to access the additional
$30.0 million available under the credit line and fees of $.3 million to be paid
to those banks approving the extension. The Company's banking group has not
accelerated the debt under the bank credit agreement. However, the Company will
be unable to meet the

EBITDA covenants for September 30, 1998 in the current bank credit agreement,
and it is unlikely that the Company will meet such existing EBITDA covenants for
future measurement dates. As a result $286,900 of the Company's long-term debt
has been reclassified as current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 1998 as
required by EITF 86-30. The Company is currently in negotiations with its bank
group to obtain a permanent amendment to its bank credit agreement. Such an
amendment would provide for attainable EBITDA and other covenants and extended
debt maturities. While the Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of
such negotiations, the Company expects to obtain such a permanent amendment to
its bank credit agreement. Once such a permanent amendment is obtained, the
Company's bank debt will be reclassified to long-term debt on the balance sheet.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
 
OVERVIEW
 
     The Company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of nationally branded
and private label paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in the $60
billion to $70 billion North American office products industry. The Company
offers a broad assortment of products including writing pads, file folders,
envelopes and other paper-based products. Through its Ampad division, the
Company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing
products, filing supplies and retail envelopes to many of the largest and
fastest growing office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division,
the Company is the leading supplier of mill branded specialty and commodity
business envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes
that its future operating results will not be directly comparable to its
historical operating results because of its strategic acquisitions. Certain
factors, which have affected, and may affect prospectively, the operating
results of the Company are discussed below.
 
     Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been accounted
for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have currently
affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of operations in
certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs (including
assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair
market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase price result in
an increase in the historical book value of certain assets such as property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, which results in
incremental annual depreciation and amortization expense each year.
 
     Raw Material. The Company's principal raw material is paper. Certain
commodity grades utilized by the Company have shown considerable price
volatility since 1992. From May 1997 through October 1997, all but one of the
key commodity grades of paper utilized by the Company increased in cost between
6% and 18%. Due to strategic customer considerations and competitive market
conditions, the Company did not begin to recover a significant portion of the
increases in paper costs affecting both its divisions until December 1997. The
Company continued to implement sales price increases during the first half of
1998. Since October 1997, the key commodity grades of paper utilized by the
Company decreased in cost between 6% and 18%. Paper price volatility is expected
to continue to have an effect on net sales and cost of sales and there is no
assurance that the Company will not be materially affected by future
fluctuations in the price of paper. Fluctuations in paper prices can have an
effect on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and financial
condition of the Company.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     Management Changes. The Company appointed James W. Swent, III as Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and David N. Pilotte as Vice
President and Corporate Controller on June 2 and 10, respectively. Mr. Swent was
previously Chief Executive Officer of Cyrix Corporation, a manufacturer of
microprocessors for the PC industry, until its merger with National
Semiconductor. In addition, he has held operations and financial executive
positions with a number of companies, including Northern Telecom, Rodime PLC and
Memorex. On July 8, 1998 the Company appointed Mr. Swent as Chief Executive
Officer and a member of its Board of Directors ("Board"). Mr. Swent replaced
Charles G. Hanson who retired from his position as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and director of the Company. Robert C. Gay, who had been a director of
American Pad & Paper since 1992 and who is a Managing Director of Bain Capital,
Inc., became Chairman of the Board. In addition, Paul B. Edgerly, a Managing
Director of Bain Capital, was added to the Board, increasing the Board size to
nine members. Also, Russel M. Gard stepped down as President and Chief Operating
Officer, but will continue his duties as Vice Chairman and a member of the
Board. Timothy E. Needham, who joined the Company in 1995 following the
acquisition of Williamhouse, was promoted to President and Chief Operating
Officer. On July 20, 1998, the Company appointed William L. Morgan as Executive
Vice President, Operations. Mr. Morgan has 35 years of progressive manufacturing
experience ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to large scale multi-national
corporations including Northern Telecom, Texas Instruments, Memorex and Fujitsu.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Company Initiatives/Restructuring. Under the leadership of new management,
the Company has begun a review of all operations with the challenge of
rebuilding market share, reducing debt and returning the Company to
profitability. On July 15, 1998, the Board approved the Company's exit from the
forms business in its current form which has produced unfavorable margins. As
part of the review process, the Company retained the management consulting firm
of Bain & Company and the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company to
assist the Company in evaluating its current position in the marketplace and in
setting the Company's long term strategic direction. Goldman Sachs will explore
external strategic and financial alternatives to maximize shareholder value.
Bain & Company will work closely with the Company's customers and suppliers to
evaluate core strengths and identify opportunities for improvement. They will
also assist the Company to restructure manufacturing to best serve each of the
Company's markets. Significant restructuring charges are expected for the three
months ending September 30, 1998.
 
     Covenant Violations/Negotiation to Modify Agreement. As a result of the
second quarter loss, the Company was in default of certain covenants based on
EBITDA levels at June 30, 1998. On June 30, 1998 the Company obtained an
amendment to its credit agreement waiving all defaults of its financial
covenants through July 31, 1998. On July 24, 1998, the waiver was extended
through September 30, 1998. The extension also amends the credit agreement to
provide for: changes in the voting procedures necessary to access the additional
$30.0 million available under the credit line and fees of $.3 million to be paid
to those banks approving the extension. The Company's banking group has not
accelerated the debt under the bank credit agreement. However, the Company will
be unable to meet the EBITDA covenants for September 30, 1998 in the current
bank credit agreement, and it is unlikely that the Company will meet such
existing EBITDA covenants for future measurement dates. As a result, $286,900 of
the Company's long-term debt has been reclassified as current portion of
long-term debt at June 30, 1998 as required by EITF 86-30. The Company is
currently in negotiations with its bank group to obtain a permanent amendment to
its bank credit agreement with attainable EBITDA and other covenants. While the
Company cannot predict with assurance the outcome of such negotiations, the
Company expects to obtain such a permanent amendment to its bank credit
agreement. Once such a permanent amendment is obtained, the Company's bank debt
will be reclassified to long-term debt on the balance sheet.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for the three months and six months
ended June 30, 1998 and 1997. The Company's historical results of operations for
each of these periods are significantly affected by the results for
Shade/Allied, which was acquired on February 11, 1997.

</TABLE>
 
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997
 
     Net Sales for the three months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $20.5
million, or 12.3%, to $146.7 million from $167.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 1997. This net sales decrease is comprised of a $11.0 million
reduction in sales spread evenly among continuous forms, envelopes and writing
products and a $9.5 million increase in customer incentives. The lower sales are
due to lower volumes caused by temporarily reduced orders resulting from major
customer inventory reductions, partially offset by higher prices. The increased
customer incentives are due to a changing product mix and additional rebate
programs caused by more competitive pricing.
 
     Gross Profit for the three months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $27.3
million, or 88.9%, to $3.4 million from $30.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 1997. Gross profit margin decreased to 2.3% for the three months ended
June 30, 1998 from 18.4% for the three months ended June 30, 1997. The decrease
in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to higher unit production costs
due to underutilized capacity resulting from the Company's efforts to reduce its
inventory, a reduction in selling margins due to competitive pricing pressures,
and a change in product mix, particularly the ongoing sales of continuous forms
at unfavorable margins. In addition, the second quarter of 1998 includes
approximately $7.5 million of charges resulting from reevaluating certain
inventories based on changes in current market conditions and accruals for
workers' compensation and property tax.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 1998
increased to $5.5 million, or 3.8% of sales from $5.2 million or 3.1% for the
three months ended June 30, 1997. The increase of $0.3 million was comprised
primarily of severance costs.
 
     General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30,
1998 increased to $9.3 million from $3.4 million for the three months ended June
30, 1997, an increase of $5.9 million. This increase is primarily attributable
to the Company's reevaluation of certain assets, which resulted in $1.7 million
of current charges for additional allowance for doubtful accounts stemming from
customer deductions and one time severance costs and litigation costs of $1.3
million. The remainder of the increase is attributable to one time charges
associated with centralizing certain functions in Dallas.
 
     Losses on sales of accounts receivable for the three months ended June 30,
1998 increased to $0.7 million from $0.6 million for the three months ended June
30, 1997 due to a higher average level of accounts receivable sold to the third
party trust in the first half of 1998, partially offset by a slightly lower
average effective interest rate.
 
     Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense for the three months
ended June 30, 1998 increased to $1.6 million from $1.5 million for the three
months ended June 30, 1997, an increase of $0.1 million.
 
     Write-down of Intangible Assets expense of $41.0 million for the three
months ended June 30, 1998 reflects a write-off of goodwill and a write-down of
intangible assets associated with the Shade/Allied continuous forms business
resulting from the Company's decision to exit the forms business in its current
form.
 
     Management fees and services expense for the three months ended June 30,
1998 amounted to $0.5 million as compared to $1.8 million for the three months
ended June 30, 1997. The change in management fees is due primarily to a one
year non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara,
which expired June 30, 1997.
 
     Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 1998 increased to
$11.1 million from $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 1997, an
increase of $1.5 million. Of this increase, $0.7 million is attributable to
increased debt levels, $0.4 million is attributable to increased interest rates
and $0.4 million is attributable to the amortization of fees paid in connection
with amendments to the credit agreement obtained in February 1998 and other
costs.
 
     The income tax provision for the three month period ended June 30, 1998
reflects an effective tax rate of 15.7% versus an effective tax rate of 45.0%
for the three month period ended June 30, 1997. Due to the expected effect of
nondeductible expenses during 1998, primarily goodwill amortization, the Company
lowered its effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 1998 to an annual
effective rate of 17.8%.
 
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997
 
     Net Sales for the six months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $8.7 million,
or 2.7%, to $308.3 million from $317.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
1997. This net sales decrease is comprised of a $4.2 million increase in sales
offset by a $12.6 million increase in customer incentives and a $0.3 million
increase in cash discounts. The net sales increase, is primarily attributable
($3.3 million) to owning Shade/ Allied for the full first half of 1998 versus
only four and a half months in the same period in 1997. The increased customer
incentives are due to a changing product mix and additional rebate programs
caused by more competitive pricing.
 
     Gross Profit for the six months ended June 30, 1998 decreased by $36.6
million, or 61.6%, to $22.8 million from $59.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 1997. Gross profit margin decreased to 7.4% for the six months ended
June 30, 1998 from 18.7% for the six months ended June 30, 1997. The

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

decrease in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to higher unit
production costs due to underutilized capacity resulting from the Company's
efforts to reduce its inventory, a reduction in selling margins due to
competitive pricing pressures, and a change in product mix, particularly the
ongoing sales of continuous forms at unfavorable margins. In addition, the
second half of 1998 includes approximately $7.5 million of charges resulting
from reevaluating certain inventories based on changes in current market
conditions and accruals for workers' compensation and property tax.
 
     Selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1998
increased to $10.2 million, or 3.3% of sales, from $9.8 million, or 3.1% of
sales, for the six months ended June 30, 1997. The increase of $0.4 million, or
0.1% of sales was comprised primarily of severance costs.
 
     General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 1998
increased to $14.7 million from $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
1997, an increase of $6.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to
the Company's reevaluation of certain assets which resulted in $1.7 million of
current charges for additional allowance for doubtful accounts stemming from
customer deductions and one time severance and litigation costs of $1.3 million.
Of the remainder of the increase, $0.1 million is attributable to owning
Shade/Allied for the full first half of 1998 versus only four and a half months
in the same period in 1997 and one time charges associated with centralizing
certain functions in Dallas.
 
     Losses on sales of accounts receivable for the six months ended June 30,
1998 increased to $1.5 million from $1.4 million for the six months ended June
30, 1997 due to a higher average interest rate, partially offset by a lower
average level of accounts receivable sold to the third party trust in the first
half of 1998.
 
     Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense for the six months ended
June 30, 1998 increased to $3.2 million from $2.9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 1997, an increase of $0.3 million, due primarily to six months
amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Shade/Allied for the
six months ended June 30, 1998 as compared to four and a half months for the six
months ended June 30, 1997.
 
     Write-down of Intangible Assets expense of $41.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 1998 reflects a write-off of goodwill and a write-down of
intangible assets associated with the Shade/Allied continuous forms business
resulting from the Company's decision to exit the forms business in its current
form.
 
     Management fees and services expense for the six months ended June 30, 1998
amounted to $1.1 million as compared to $3.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 1997. The change in management fees is due primarily to a one-year
non-recurring consulting agreement with the former president of Niagara, which
expired June 30, 1997.
 
     Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 1998 increased to $21.8
million from $17.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1997, an increase
of $4.0 million. Of this increase, $2.6 million is attributable to increased
debt levels, $0.9 million is attributable to increased interest rates and $0.5
million is attributable to amortization of fees paid in connection with
amendments to the credit agreement obtained in February 1998 and other costs.
 
     The income tax provision for the six month period ended June 30, 1998
reflects an effective tax rate of 17.8% versus an effective tax rate of 45.0%
for the six month period ended June 30, 1997. Due to the expected effect of
nondeductible expenses during 1998, primarily goodwill amortization, the Company
lowered its effective income tax rate in 1998.
 
KNOWN TRENDS AND SEASONALITY
 
     The Company does experience some seasonality in its business operations.
During the Company's third and fourth quarters, net sales tend to be higher than
in the first and second quarters due to higher product sales of back-to-school,
seasonal greeting card and tax filing products.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     The Company's Ampad division sells primarily to fast growing customers such
as office products superstores, mass merchants and national contract stationers.
Such customers periodically adjust the levels of inventory in the retail
distribution channels, either in retail stores or in distribution centers. The
Company has determined that lower than expected sales will occur during the
quarters in which such downward adjustments are made. The Company is not able to
predict the future effect of such adjustments; however, it is likely that its
retail customers will continue to adjust inventory levels in future quarters.
 
     The Company's gross profit is directly affected by, among other factors,
the mix of products sold. Based on the Company's current product categories, the
Company's gross profit will be negatively or positively affected as the actual
product sales mix changes.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30,
1998 was $22.2 million as compared to net cash used by operating activities for
the six months ended June 30, 1997 of $32.5 million. This increase is primarily
the net result of the following: (i) cash used by the net loss of $5.3 million
after adjustment for non-cash expenses, (ii) a decrease in accounts receivable
of $48.6 million as a result of collection of year end receivable balances and
improving days sales outstanding in receivables, (iii) a decrease in inventories
of $13.7 million, (iv) a reduction of accounts payable of $22.9 million, and (v)
a net change in other assets and liabilities of $11.9 million.
 
     Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 1998
and 1997 was $8.7 million and $60.1 million, respectively. The first half 1998
use was due to the purchase of equipment, principally production equipment. The
first half of 1997 use was due to the Shade/Allied acquisition of $50.5 million
and purchases of equipment of $9.6 million.
 
     Net cash provided by financing activities during the first six months of
1998 and 1997 was $13.1 million and $92.0 million, respectively. Net cash
provided during the first half of 1998 resulted from the net of the repayment of
$12.0 million in financing outstanding under the accounts receivable credit
facility, payment of fees in connection with amendments to the bank credit
agreement of $1.4 million and borrowings of $27.5 million under the bank credit
agreement. During the first half of 1997, the Company borrowed $110.5 million to
finance (i) repayment of $18.0 million in notes outstanding under its accounts
receivable credit facility, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii) the
purchases of equipment and (iv) its working capital needs.
 
     A portion of the consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at
floating rates; therefore, its financial condition is and will continue to be
affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into
an interest rate protection agreement to minimize the impact from a rise in
interest rates.
 
     In February 1998, the Company and its banking group agreed to an increase
in the size of the revolving credit agreement from $300.0 million to $330.0
million for a period of one year. After such time, the level of debt available
under such credit agreement will be reduced to $300.0 million. In December 1997,
February 1998 and April 1998, certain covenants in the credit agreement were
also modified as of the end of 1997 and for a period ending in February 1999.
Unless approved by the banking group, the Company will be restricted to $15.0
million in net capital expenditures for 1998 and will be restricted from any
acquisitions. The interest rate incurred by the Company will vary each quarter
in 1998 depending on the Company's consolidated debt to EBITDA ratio at the
beginning of each quarter. The Company paid fees and expenses of $1.4 million to
its banking group and lawyers in connection with the amendments to the credit
agreement.
 
     As a result of the second quarter loss, the Company was in default of
certain EBITDA covenants at June 30, 1998. On June 30, 1998 the Company obtained
an amendment to its credit agreement waiving all defaults of its financial
covenants through July 31, 1998. On July 24, 1998, the waiver was extended
through

September 30, 1998. The extension also amended the credit agreement to provide
for: changes in the voting procedures necessary to access the additional $30.0
million available under the credit line and fees of $.3 million to be paid to
those banks approving the extension. The Company's banking group has not
accelerated the debt under the bank credit agreement. However, the Company will
be unable to meet the EBITDA covenants for September 30, 1998 in the current
bank credit agreement and it is unlikely that the Company will meet such
existing EBITDA covenants for future measurement dates. As a result, $286,900 of
the Company's long-term debt has been reclassified as current portion of
long-term debt at June 30, 1998 as required by EITF 86-30. The Company is
currently in negotiations with its bank group to obtain a permanent amendment to
its bank credit agreement with attainable EBITDA and other covenants and
extended debt maturities. While the Company cannot predict with assurance the
outcome of such negotiations, the Company expects to obtain such a permanent
amendment to its bank credit agreement. Once such a permanent amendment is
obtained, the Company's bank debt will be reclassified to long-term debt on the
balance sheet.
 
     The ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce
its total debt will be dependent upon obtaining the previously described
permanent amendment to its bank credit agreement and the future performance of
the Company and its subsidiaries. In turn, such performance will be subject to
general economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors,
including factors beyond the Company's control. Should the Company not be able
to obtain such an amendment, the Company would explore other financing
alternatives. These alternatives include but are not limited to a refinancing of
its bank debt, raising new private or public debt, raising additional public
equity capital, reducing the level of capital expenditures, reducing operating
costs and selling certain assets. While the Company expects that it will obtain
the previously described amendment to the bank credit agreement and/or that
other financing will be available and that there will be sufficient funds for
1999 operations, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the
bank agreement amendment or financing discussions.
 
     Management believes that, based upon cash on hand of $31.4 million at June
30, 1998, estimates of current and future operations, and other available
sources of funds including borrowings under the bank credit agreement and the
accounts receivable facility, its finances will be adequate for 1998 to make
required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to
fund anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $7 million during the
remainder of 1998, and to meet working capital requirements.
 
INFLATION
 
     The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997.
 
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
     The Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 98-5, which is effective for fiscal years commencing after
December 15, 1998. SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities,
prescribes that start-up costs, including organization costs, should be expensed
as incurred. The SOP states that initial application should be reported as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company will adopt
this SOP for its fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. Assuming an effective tax
rate of 42.5% for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1999, the Company will
report a charge of $.4 million (net of tax benefit of $.3 million) in the first
quarter of 1999.

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking
statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Forward-looking statements
include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements which are

publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature.
All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and
whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are also expressly qualified by
these cautionary statements. Certain statements contained herein are
forward-looking statements and accordingly involve risks and uncertainties,
which could cause actual results, or outcomes to differ materially from those
expressed in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements
contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based, in
turn, upon further assumptions. The Company's expectations, beliefs and
projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have
a reasonable basis, including without limitation, management's examination of
historical operating trends, data contained in the Company's records and other
data available from third parties, but there can be no assurance that
management's expectation, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or
accomplished. In addition to the other factors and matters discussed elsewhere
herein, the following are important factors that, in the view of the Company,
could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the
forward-looking statements:
 
         1. Changes in economic conditions, in particular those, which affect
            the retail and wholesale office product markets.
 
         2. Changes in the availability and/or price of paper, in particular if
            increases in the price of paper are not passed along to the
            Company's customers.
 
         3. Changes in senior management or control of the Company.
 
         4. Inability to obtain new customers or retain existing ones.
 
         5. Significant changes in competitive factors, including product
            pricing conditions, affecting the Company.
 
         6. Governmental/regulatory actions and initiatives, including, those
            affecting financings.
 
         7. Significant changes from expectations in actual capital expenditures
            and operating expenses.
 
         8. Occurrences affecting the Company's ability to obtain funds from
            operations, debt or equity to finance needed capital expenditures
            and other investments.
 
         9. Significant changes in rates of interest, inflation or taxes.
 
        10. Significant changes in the Company's relationship with its employees
            and the potential adverse effects if labor disputes or grievances
            were to occur.
 
        11. Changes in accounting principles and/or the application of such
            principles to the Company.
 
     The foregoing factors could affect the Company's actual results and could
cause the Company's actual results during 1998 and beyond to be materially
different from any anticipated results expressed in any forward-looking
statement made by or on behalf of the Company.
 
     The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or other circumstances after date hereof.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
     As part of its Bank Credit Agreement, the Company was required to purchase
an interest rate cap for a nominal portion of the outstanding debt. The premium
paid for the interest rate cap agreement is amortized as interest expense over
the term of the agreement. The amounts concerned are immaterial to both the
financial position and operations of the Company.

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     Between March 10, 1998 and April 11, 1998, three complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The
Company, certain of its officers and directors and certain of the underwriters
and other entities involved in the Company's initial public offering were named
as defendants in the first two complaints. These complaints were filed by
stockholders who claim to represent a purported class of stockholders who
acquired shares of the Company's common stock between July 2, 1996 and December
17, 1997. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief under the
federal securities laws based on allegations that the Company made omissions and
misleading disclosures in public reports and press releases and to securities
analysts during 1996 and 1997 concerning the Company's financial condition, its
future business prospects and the impact of various acquisitions. These two
lawsuits were consolidated on July 2, 1998. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to plaintiff's claims and intends to vigorously defend the
action.
 
     The third complaint, which was filed on behalf of a purported class of
stockholders who acquired shares of the Company's common stock between February
18, 1997 and December 17, 1997 and named the Company and certain of its officers
as defendants, was dismissed on June 29, 1998.

     WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Banks provide the Waiver
provided for herein and the Banks have agreed to provide such Waiver on the
terms and conditions set forth herein;
 
     NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:
 
          1. Effective from and including June 30, 1998 through and including
     July 31, 1998 (the "Waiver Termination Date"), the Banks hereby waive
     compliance with the provisions of Section 8.10, Section 8.11 and Section
     8.12 of the Credit Agreement. This Waiver shall be effective only for the
     period from June 30, 1998 to and including the Waiver Termination Date (the
     "Waiver Period") and shall be of no force or effect at any other time.
 
          2. In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Waiver, the
     Borrower agrees that at all times from the Waiver Effective Date to and
     including the Waiver Termination Date, the sum of (i) the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans and
     (ii) the Letter of Credit Outstandings under the Credit Agreement shall not
     exceed $300,000,000.
 
          3. In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Waiver, each of
     Holdings, WR Acquisition and the Borrower hereby represents and warrants
     that (i) no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Waiver Effective
     Date (as defined below) after giving effect to this Waiver and (ii) on the
     Waiver Effective Date, both before and after giving effect to this Waiver,
     all representations and warranties contained in the Credit Agreement and in
     the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all material respects.
 
          4. This Waiver shall become effective on the date (the "Waiver
     Effective Date") when the Required Banks, Holdings, WR Acquisition and the
     Borrower shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or
     different counterparts) and shall have delivered (including by way of
     facsimile transmission) the same to the Agent at its Notice Office.
 
          5. This Waiver is limited as specified and shall not constitute a
     modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Credit
     Agreement or any other Credit Document.
 
          6. This Waiver may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
     the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
     counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
     which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set
     of counterparts shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Agent.
 
          7. At all times during the Waiver Period, all references in the Credit
     Agreement and each of the Credit Documents to the Credit Agreement shall be
     deemed to be references to such Credit Agreement after giving effect to
     this Waiver.

                                  WITNESSETH:
 
     WHEREAS, Holdings, WR Acquisition, the Borrower, the Banks, the Co-Agents
and the Agent are party to a Credit Agreement, dated as of July 8, 1996 (as
amended, modified and supplemented prior to the date hereof, the "Credit
Agreement");
 
     WHEREAS, Holdings, WR Acquisition, the Borrower, the Banks, the Co-Agents
and the Agent are party to the Fifth Waiver and Amendment, dated as of June 30,
1998 (the "Fifth Amendment"); and
 
     WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Banks provide the amendment
provided for herein and the Banks have agreed to provide such amendment on the
terms and conditions set forth herein;
 
     NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:
 
          1. The Waiver Termination Date (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) is
     hereby extended to September 30, 1998.
 
          2. Section 8.06(a) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
     inserting the following proviso at the end thereof:
 
        "; provided that (i) Foreign Subsidiaries may not hold Foreign Cash
        Equivalents in excess of $25,000 (or the equivalent thereof in foreign
        currencies) at any time and (ii) 100% of all cash and Cash Equivalents
        held by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than the Receivables
        Entity) at any time (other than up to $1,000,000 of cash and Cash
        Equivalents, including without limitation cash and Cash Equivalents
        pledged or deposited in accordance with Section 8.03(f)) must be held in
        one or more accounts maintained with the Agent or a Bank."
 
          3. Each Bank hereby agrees that for the purposes of Section 5.02 of
     the Credit Agreement, any amendment or waiver of a Default or an Event of
     Default, the effect of which would be to allow the sum of (i) the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans and
     (ii) the Letter of Credit Outstandings under the Credit Agreement to exceed
     $300,000,000, shall not be effective without the consent of the
     Supermajority Banks (it being understood and agreed that any Default or
     Event or Default that may be otherwise waived or amended with the consent
     of the Required Banks may still be waived or amended by the Required Banks
     for any purpose other than for the purpose set forth above in this Section
     3).
 
          4. The following definition is hereby inserted into Section 10 of the
     Credit Agreement in alphabetical order:
 
             "Supermajority Banks" shall mean collectively (and not
        individually) Non-Defaulting Banks the sum of whose Revolving Loan
        Commitments (or, if after the Total Revolving Loan Commitment has been
        terminated, outstanding Revolving Loans and Percentages of outstanding
        Swingline Loans and Letter of Credit Outstandings) constitute greater
        than 66 2/3% of the Total Revolving Loan Commitment less the aggregate
        Revolving Loan Commitments of Defaulting Banks (or, if after the Total
        Revolving Loan Commitment has been terminated, the total outstanding
        Revolving Loans of
<PAGE>   2
 
        Non-Defaulting Banks and the aggregate Percentages of all Non-Defaulting
        Banks of the total outstanding Swingline Loans and Letter of Credit
        Outstandings at such time).
 
          5. In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Amendment, the
     Borrower hereby agrees to pay to each Bank which executes and delivers a
     counterpart of this Amendment on or before 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on
     July 30, 1998, a fee equal to 1/8 of 1% of such Bank's Revolving Loan
     Commitment, such fee to be earned and payable on the Amendment Effective
     Date.
 
          6. In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Amendment, each of
     Holdings, WR Acquisition and the Borrower hereby represents and warrants
     that (i) no Default or Event of Default exists as of the Amendment
     Effective Date (as defined below) after giving effect to this Amendment and
     (ii) on the Amendment Effective Date, both before and after giving effect
     to this Amendment, all representations and warranties contained in the
     Credit Agreement and in the other Credit Documents are true and correct in
     all material respects.
 
          7. This Amendment shall become effective on the date (the "Amendment
     Effective Date") when the Required Banks, Holdings, WR Acquisition and the
     Borrower shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or
     different counterparts) and shall have delivered (including by way of
     facsimile transmission) the same to the Agent at its Notice Office.
 
          8. This Amendment is limited as specified and shall not constitute a
     modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Fifth
     Amendment, the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document.
 
          9. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
     the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
     counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
     which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set
     of counterparts shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Agent.
 
          10. All references in the Credit Agreement and each of the Credit
     Documents to the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be references to such
     Credit Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment.
 
          11. THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
     HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
     THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
                                    -  -  -
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused a counterpart of
this Amendment to be duly executed and delivered as of the date hereof.

to this release if he does so within 7 days of executing it and that this

is intended to be severable.  If any term or provision is held to be invalid,
void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason
whatsoever, such ruling shall not effect the remainder of this Release.

         7.  CGH, intending to be legally bound, has voluntarily executed this 
Release with full understanding of the contents hereof and after having had
ample time to review and study the  Letter Agreement and this Release.

         Signed and executed this ____ day of July, 1998.

             AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY RECEIVES WAIVER EXTENSION

     DALLAS, Texas, July 31, 1998 - American Pad & Paper (NYSE:AGP) announced 
today that it has executed an amendment with its banking group waiving all the
defaults of the financial covenants of its loan agreement through September 30,
1998.

     James W. Swent, III, Chief Executive Officer said, "We are extremely 
pleased with the support we have received from our banks in working through this
issue. We will be working with the banks during the third quarter to negotiate a
permanent amendment to the current agreement that will be beneficial to all
parties.  In addition to our banks, we have received strong support from all our
vendors and customers including our independent merchants, our regional and
national chains, our contract stationers, and our superstores."

     American Pad & Paper Company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of
paper-based office products in North America.  The company manufactures and
distributes writing pads, folders, envelopes and other office products.  Name
brands include Ampad, Century, Embassy, Gold fibre, Huxley, Karolton, Kent,
Peel & Seel, SCM, Williamhouse and World Fibre.

     This release contains forward-looking statements relating to future 
results. Actual results may differ significantly as a result of factors over
which the company has no control, including the strength of domestic and foreign
economies, slower than anticipated sales growth, price and product competition
and increases in raw material costs.  Additional information which could affect
the company's financial results is included in the company's prospectus on file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
