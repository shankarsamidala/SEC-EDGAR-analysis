      If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort
 or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the

      (b)  The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report

      (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 
           12b-25 (c) has been attached, if applicable. 


                                  PART III 
                                 NARRATIVE 
  
      State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-
 F, 10-Q, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be filed
 within the prescribed time period. 
  
      As previously announced, earlier this year the Audit Committee of the
 Board of Directors of Sunbeam Corporation (the "Company") determined that
 the Company would be required to restate its audited financial statements
 for 1997 and possibly 1996, as well as its unaudited financial statements
 for the first quarter of 1998.  This conclusion was reached by the Audit
 Committee based on information presented to it by the Company's outside
 auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, and the accounting firm assisting the Audit
 Committee, Deloitte & Touche LLP.  On October 20, 1998, the Company
 announced the restatement of its financial results for the six quarter
 period from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of 1998. 
  
      The Company filed an amended 1997 Form 10-K/A on November 12, 1998 and
 is now in the process of preparing an amended Form 10-Q/A for the first
 quarter of 1998, as well as the initial filing of its Form 10-Q for the
 second quarter of 1998, which, as disclosed in a Form 12b-25 filed with the
 Commission on August 13, 1998, the Company was not able to file timely. 
 The Company anticipates making these filings prior to the filing of its
 third quarter 1998 Form 10-Q. 
  
      As a result of the significant time and effort being expended by the
 Company and its advisors in connection with the preparation of the filings
 referred to above, however, the Company will not be in a position to file
 timely its third quarter 1998 Form 10-Q.  Nevertheless, the Company does
 intend to file its third quarter Form 10-Q no later than the fifth calendar
 day following the prescribed due date, as contemplated by Rule 12b-25(b)(2)
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

  
                                  PART IV 
                             OTHER INFORMATION 
  
      (1)  Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
 notification: 
  
 Janet G. Kelley                       (561)                 243-2127 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (Name)                         (Area Code)         (Telephone Number) 
  
      (2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or
 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the
 Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such
 shorter period that the registrant was required to file such report (s)
 been filed?  If the answer is no, identify report(s).    
  
                                                         ( )  Yes   (X)  No 
  
      As noted above, the Company failed to timely file its Quarterly Report
 on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1998. 
  
      (3)  Is it  anticipated that any significant change in results of
 operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
 reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report
 or portion thereof? 
  
                                                         (X)  Yes   ( )  No 
  
      If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
 narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why
 a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made. 
  
      The Company is still in the process of completing the analysis of its
 results of operations for the third quarter of 1998.  Based on the
 Company's results of operations for the first and second quarters of 1998,
 however, it appears that the earnings statements contained in the Company's
 third quarter 1998 Form 10-Q may reflect significant changes in the
 Company's results of operations from the corresponding period in the prior
 fiscal year.  The Company is working with Arthur Andersen LLP to review the
 Company's financial records and quantify the amount of any change from the
 prior fiscal year.  Until this review is completed, however, no estimate
 can be made of the extent to which the Company's results of operations will
 deviate from those reported during the corresponding period in the prior
 fiscal year.
