(a)           BASIS OF PRESENTATION
              The consolidated  financial  statements have been prepared by AT&T
              Corp.  (AT&T)  pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the
              Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) and, in the opinion of
              management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement
              of the consolidated results of operations,  financial position and
              cash flows for each period presented. The consolidated results for
              interim periods are not necessarily  indicative of results for the
              full year.  These financial  results should be read in conjunction
              with  AT&T's  Form 10-K/A for the year ended  December  31,  1998,
              AT&T's Form 10-Q for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  1999,  (which
              includes  the  financial  results of Liberty  Media Group for this
              period,  attached  as an  exhibit  thereto),  Tele-Communications,
              Inc.'s (TCI) Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998, TCI's
              Form 10-Q for the quarter  ended  March 31,  1999,  the  financial
              statements of Liberty Media Group for the year ended  December 31,
              1998, included in AT&T's Form 8-K filed on March 22, 1999, and the
              financial  statements  of  Liberty  Media  Group  and  TCI for the
              quarter and year-to-date  periods ended June 30, 1999, included as
              Exhibits  99.1 and  99.2,  respectively,  to this  AT&T  quarterly
              report on Form 10-Q.

              On May 19, 1999,  the Board of  Directors  of Liberty  Media Group
              declared  a two for one stock  split,  paid on June 11,  1999,  to
              shareowners of record on May 28, 1999. All references to number of
              shares (except shares authorized or where otherwise indicated) and
              per share  information for Liberty Media Group in the consolidated
              financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split
              on a retroactive basis.

              We have  reclassified  certain prior period  amounts to conform to
              our current  presentation  and have  restated  share and per share
              information  to reflect the first  quarter  three for two split of
              AT&T's common stock.

(b)           MERGER WITH TCI
              The merger with TCI was  completed in the first quarter of 1999 in
              an all stock transaction valued at approximately $52 billion. AT&T
              issued  approximately  664 million shares in the  transaction,  of
              which  approximately 149 million were treasury shares. Also in the
              first quarter of 1999 in connection with the merger of TCI and the
              formation  of Liberty  Media Group from TCI's  former  programming
              business  and  technology  investments  business,  AT&T  issued  a
              separate  tracking stock designed to reflect the separate economic
              performance  of Liberty Media Group. A total of 540 million shares
              (1,080  million  shares on a  post-slit  basis) of Class A Liberty
              Media Group  Tracking  Stock and 55 million  shares  (110  million
              shares  on a  post-split  basis) of Class B  Liberty  Media  Group
              Tracking  Stock were  issued by AT&T.  AT&T also issued 30 million
              shares  (60  million  shares  on a  post-split  basis)  of Class A
              Liberty  Media  Group  Tracking  Stock  in  connection   with  the
              conversion of certain convertible notes.

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

              AT&T does not have a  controlling  financial  interest  in Liberty
              Media Group,  therefore it has been  reflected as an equity method
              investment in the accompanying  consolidated financial statements.
              The results  attributable  to Liberty Media Group are reflected as
              separate line items  "Equity  losses from Liberty Media Group" and
              "Investment  in Liberty Media Group and related  receivables",  in
              the accompanying  consolidated financial statements. As a separate
              tracking  stock,  all of the earnings or losses related to Liberty
              Media  Group  are  excluded  from the  earnings  available  to the
              holders  of AT&T  common  stock.  TCI's  cable and  certain  other
              operations,   including   its   ownership   interest  in  At  Home
              Corporation  (Excite@Home),  became AT&T  broadband  and  Internet
              services,  and were combined with the existing AT&T  operations to
              form the AT&T common stock group (AT&T Group).

              The merger with TCI was recorded as a purchase.  Accordingly,  the
              operating  results of TCI have been  included in the  accompanying
              consolidated  financial statements since March 1, 1999, the deemed
              effective date of acquisition for accounting purposes.  The impact
              of the  results  from March 1,  1999,  through  March 9, 1999,  is
              deemed immaterial to our consolidated  results.  The excess of the
              aggregate purchase price of $52.155 billion over the fair value of
              net assets  acquired was  estimated  at $24 billion,  and is being
              amortized on a straight-line  basis over seven to 40 years.  Also,
              approximately  $11  billion of goodwill  related to Liberty  Media
              Group  was  recorded  as  part  of our  investment  and  is  being
              amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years as a component of
              equity earnings (losses) from Liberty Media Group.

              Following is a summary of the noncash impact of the TCI merger:

              Fair value of net assets acquired           $ 28
              Excess purchase price over fair value of

              stock.

              At June 30, 1999,  there was $40 of  restricted  cash  included in
              cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance
              sheet.  The  restricted  cash was comprised  primarily of proceeds
              received in  connection  with certain asset  dispositions  of TCI,
              which are designated to be reinvested in certain identified assets
              for tax purposes.

(c)           OTHER MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, VENTURES AND DISPOSITIONS
              On April 30,  1999,  AT&T  completed  its  acquisition  of the IBM
              Global Network (IGN) business and its assets in the United States.
              The  acquisition is occurring in phases  throughout  1999 as legal
              and regulatory requirements are met in each of the 59 countries in
              which the business operates.  In June of 1999, the acquisitions of
              the IGN  business in Japan,  the United  Kingdom and Ireland  were
              completed.  The  acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase.
              Accordingly,  the operating  results of the IGN business have been
              included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements
              since the date of acquisition.  Intangible assets of approximately
              $3.9  billion  including  customer  lists  and the  excess  of the
              purchase  price  over the fair value of net  assets  acquired  are
              being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
              five to 30 years. The pro forma impact of the IGN business results
              on historical AT&T results are not material.

              On May 3, 1999, AT&T closed the previously  announced  merger with
              Vanguard Cellular Systems,  Inc.  (Vanguard).  Consummation of the
              merger resulted in the issuance of approximately 12.6 million AT&T
              shares and  payment of $485 in cash.  In  addition,  Vanguard  had
              approximately $550 in debt, which was subsequently repaid by AT&T.
              The merger with  Vanguard was recorded as a purchase.  Accordingly
              the  operating  results  of  Vanguard  have been  included  in the
              accompanying  consolidated  financial statements since the date of
              acquisition.   The  pro  forma  impact  of  Vanguard   results  on
              historical AT&T results are not material.

              On June 1, 1999, AT&T Canada  completed the announced  merger with
              MetroNet   Communications  Corp.   (MetroNet),   Canada's  largest
              facilities-based  competitive  local exchange carrier (CLEC).  The
              combined companies were renamed AT&T Canada. AT&T owns a 31% stake
              in the  merged  entity,  which  maintains  a  national  network to
              provide Canadian  business  customers with local and long distance
              voice, data,  Internet and electronic commerce services as well as
              wireless services through Rogers Cantel AT&T.

              On June 7,  1999,  AT&T  signed a  definitive  agreement  with Cox
              Communications,  Inc.  (Cox)  whereby Cox will  exchange  its AT&T
              stock  for  cable  television  systems  that  serve  approximately
              495,000   customers  as  well  as  certain  other   consideration,
              including  cash.  Based on the closing  price of AT&T's stock when
              the  agreement  was  announced,   the  transaction  is  valued  at
              approximately $2.8 billion. The agreement has been approved by the
              boards  of  both  companies  and  will  be  subject  to  necessary
              government and regulatory approvals.

              On June 29, 1999, the previously  announced global venture between
              AT&T and British  Telecommunications  plc (BT)  received  approval
              from the U.S. Justice Department. The venture has already received
              approval  from the European  Commission.  The global  venture will
              combine the transborder assets and operations of each company. The
              venture  will be equally  owned by both  companies  when it begins
              operations. The receipt of certain additional regulatory approvals
              is required  and the venture is  expected to be  completed  in the
              second half of 1999.

              On  May  28,  1999,  At  Home  Corporation  consummated  a  merger
              agreement  with Excite,  Inc.  (Excite),  a global  Internet media
              company  that  offers  consumers  and  advertisers   comprehensive
              Internet  navigation   services  with  extensive   personalization
              capabilities.  Under the terms of the  merger  agreement,  At Home
              Corporation issued  approximately 116 million shares of its common
              stock (as  adjusted  for a June 1999  stock  split) for all of the
              outstanding  common stock of Excite based on an exchange  ratio of
              2.083804 shares of At Home Corporation's common stock (as adjusted
              for a June 1999 stock  split) for each  share of  Excite's  common
              stock. As a result of the merger,  AT&T's economic  interest in At
              Home Corporation  (Excite@Home) decreased from 38.8% to 26.5%. Due
              to the  resulting  increase in  Excite@Home's  equity,  net of the
              dilution  of  AT&T's  ownership  interest  in  Excite@Home,   AT&T
              recorded a $466  increase to additional  paid in capital.  At June
              30, 1999,  AT&T owned  63,720,000  shares of  Excite@Home  Class A
              common  stock (as adjusted for a June 1999 stock split) and has an
              approximate  58% voting  interest on certain  matters.  During the
              second quarter of 1999, the  stockholders of Excite@Home  approved
              certain changes in the corporate  governance of Excite@Home.  As a
              result of these  changes,  management  has concluded  that AT&T no
              longer holds a controlling  financial interest in Excite@Home and,
              accordingly,  during the second  quarter of 1999,  AT&T  ceased to
              consolidate Excite@Home and began to account for Excite@Home using
              the   equity   method   of   accounting.   The   effect   of  this
              deconsolidation  was not  material to the  consolidated  financial
              statements of AT&T.

(d)           CUMULATIVE QUARTERLY INCOME PREFERRED SHARES AND WARRANTS
              On June 16, 1999, AT&T Finance Trust I, a wholly-owned  subsidiary
              of AT&T  established as a Delaware  statutory  business trust (the
              Trust), completed the private placement sale of 100 million shares
              of  5.0%  cumulative   quarterly   income   preferred   securities
              (liquidation   preference   of  $50  per  security)  to  Microsoft
              Corporation (Microsoft). Proceeds of the issuance were invested in
              Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) issued by AT&T due
              2029 which represent the sole assets of the Trust.

              The  cumulative   quarterly   income   preferred   securities  are
              convertible  at any time prior to  maturity  into  66.667  million
              shares of AT&T stock at $75 per share and are subject to mandatory
              redemption  upon  repayment of the Debentures at maturity or their
              earlier  redemption.  The  conversion  feature can be  terminated,
              under certain conditions, after three years.

              The  Debentures  will make a  quarterly  payment of 62.5 cents per
              security  payable  quarterly  in arrears on the last day of March,
              June,  September and December of each year.  AT&T has the right to
              defer such interest payments up to 20 consecutive  quarters;  as a
              consequence,   quarterly   dividend  payments  on  the  cumulative
              quarterly income preferred securities can be deferred by the Trust
              during  any such  interest  payment  period.  If AT&T  defers  any
              interest  payments,  AT&T may not,  among  other  things,  pay any
              dividends  on its common  stock  until all  interest in arrears is
              paid to the Trust.

              Distributions   on  the  cumulative   quarterly  income  preferred
              securities  are  reported  within  other  income  (expense) in the
              accompanying consolidated statements of income.

              On June 16,  1999,  AT&T  also  issued  to  Microsoft  40  million
              warrants,  each to purchase  one share of AT&T  common  stock at a
              price of $75 per share at the end of three years.  If the warrants
              are not  exercised on the  three-year  anniversary  of the closing
              date, the warrants expire.

              A discount on the cumulative quarterly income preferred securities
              equal to the value of the warrants of $306 has been recognized and
              is  being  amortized  over  the 30  year  life  of the  cumulative
              quarterly  income  preferred  securities  as a component  of other
              income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

(e)           RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES, NET
              Restructuring and other charges,  net were a pretax benefit of $29
              for the second quarter of 1999. The benefit  included a $68 pretax
              net gain  primarily  related to the exit of certain joint ventures
              that would have competed  directly with the global venture AT&T is
              forming  with BT.  Also  included  was an $11 pretax gain from the
              settlement of pension obligations from AT&T's voluntary retirement
              incentive  program offer.  Partially  offsetting these gains was a
              $50 pretax charge  recorded in the second  quarter of 1999 related
              to the  estimated  losses  that  are  expected  to  result  from a
              contribution  agreement  TCI entered into with  Phoenixstar,  Inc.
              (Phoenixstar),   formerly  Primestar,   Inc.,  a  previous  equity
              investment.  To the extent  necessary,  the company is required to
              satisfy  certain   liabilities  of   Phoenixstar.   The  remaining
              obligation under this contribution agreement which expires in 2001
              is $26.

              Second quarter 1998 restructuring and other charges, net of $2,743
              pretax  primarily  related  to  charges   associated  with  AT&T's
              voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

              Restructuring and other charges, net for the six months ended June
              30,  1999,  were $702  pretax.  Included  in this  balance  was an
              in-process  research and development charge of $594 pretax related
              to the TCI acquisition, a $128 pretax net charge primarily related
              to the exit of certain  joint  ventures  that would have  competed
              directly with the global venture AT&T is forming with BT and a $50
              pretax charge related to the  Phoenixstar  agreement  noted above.
              These charges were  partially  offset by a $70 pretax gain related
              to the settlement of pension  obligations for former employees who
              accepted AT&T's voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

              Restructuring and other charges, net for the six months ended June
              30, 1998,  were $3,344 pretax.  The charge is comprised of a first
              quarter  1998  pretax  charge  of $601  which  resulted  from  the
              decision not to pursue  Total  Service  Resale as a  local-service
              strategy as well as the second  quarter  $2,743 net pretax  charge
              primarily related to AT&T's voluntary retirement incentive program
              offer.

(f)           EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE AND POTENTIAL COMMON SHARE
              Basic  earnings  per share  (EPS) for AT&T Group for the three and
              six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, were computed by dividing
              income  attributable  to  AT&T  Group  common  shareowners  by the
              weighted-average number of common shares outstanding of AT&T Group
              during the period.

              Diluted EPS for AT&T Group for the three and six months ended June
              30, 1999,  and the six months ended June 30, 1998, was computed by
              dividing the income  attributable to AT&T Group common shareowners
              by the  weighted-average  number of  common  shares  and  dilutive
              potential  common  shares  outstanding  of AT&T  Group  during the
              period,  assuming conversion of the potential common shares at the
              beginning  of  the  periods   presented.   Shares   issuable  upon
              conversion of preferred stock of  subsidiaries,  convertible  debt
              securities of subsidiary,  quarterly income preferred  securities,
              stock options and other  performance  awards have been included in
              the diluted calculation of  weighted-average  shares to the extent
              that the assumed issuance of such shares would have been dilutive,
              as illustrated  below.  The  convertible  debt securities were all
              converted  as of  March  31,  1999.  Since  AT&T  had a loss  from
              continuing  operations  for the three  months ended June 30, 1998,
              the impact of any potential  shares would have been  antidilutive,
              and therefore are not factored into the diluted calculation. There
              were 13 million potentially  dilutive  securities  outstanding for
              this period.

              Income  from  continuing  operations  for the three and  six-month
              periods ended June 30, 1999,  of $1,045 and $2,063,  respectively,
              include income from  continuing  operations  attributable  to AT&T
              Group of $1,588 and $2,664,  respectively,  as well as losses from
              Liberty Media Group of $(543) and $(601) respectively.

              A reconciliation  of the income and share components for the basic
              and diluted EPS calculations with respect to AT&T Group continuing
              operations is as follows:

              Basic EPS for  Liberty  Media  Group  for the three and  six-month
              periods  ended June 30, 1999,  was computed by dividing the income
              attributable   to  Liberty   Media   Group   shareowners   by  the
              weighted-average  number of shares  outstanding  of Liberty  Media
              Group of 1.264 billion and 1.250 billion,  respectively, for these
              periods.  Since  Liberty  Media Group had a loss for both periods,
              the impact of any potential  shares would have been  antidilutive,
              and  therefore  are not  factored  into the diluted  calculations.
              There were 54 million potentially dilutive securities  outstanding
              at June 30, 1999.

(g)           PREFERRED STOCK
              TCI  has  1.552  million   shares  of  Class  B  Preferred   Stock
              outstanding  as  of  June  30,  1999,  net  of  shares  held  by a
              subsidiary, out of an authorized 1.675 million shares.

              Dividends  accrue  cumulatively  (but without  compounding)  at an
              annual  rate of 6% of the  stated  liquidation  value  of $100 per
              share,  whether or not such  dividends  are  declared or funds are
              legally available for payment of dividends.  Accrued dividends are
              payable annually on March 1 of each year in cash or AT&T stock, or
              any  combination  of the  foregoing at the sole  discretion of the
              AT&T  Board  of  Directors.  Accrued  dividends  not  paid  on any
              dividend payment date will accumulate.

              The amount of Class B Preferred  Stock and  accumulated  dividends
              thereon  are  reflected  within  "Minority  Interest  in Equity of
              Consolidated   Subsidiaries"  in  the  accompanying   consolidated
              balance sheet and aggregated $147 at June 30, 1999.

              TCI Pacific  Communications  Inc. (Pacific) issued preferred stock
              which remains  outstanding  after the TCI merger.  There are 6.258
              million shares of Pacific  authorized and  outstanding at June 30,
              1999.  Each  share of the  Pacific  5%  Class A Senior  Cumulative
              Exchangeable  Preferred  Stock is  exchangeable,  from  and  after
              August 1, 2001,  for  approximately  6.3375  shares of AT&T Common
              Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. Additionally,
              Pacific may elect to make any dividend,  redemption or liquidation
              payment in cash,  shares of AT&T Common Stock or by a  combination
              of the  foregoing.  The  amount  of  Pacific  Preferred  Stock and
              accumulated  dividends  thereon  are  reflected  within  "Minority
              Interest   in  Equity  of   Consolidated   Subsidiaries"   in  the
              accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheet  and  aggregated  $2.1
              billion at June 30, 1999.


(h)           FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
              In  the  normal  course  of  business  we  use  various  financial
              instruments,   including  derivative  financial  instruments,  for
              purposes other than trading.  We do not use  derivative  financial
              instruments for speculative  purposes.  These instruments  include
              letters  of  credit,   guarantees  of  debt,  interest  rate  swap
              agreements and foreign currency exchange contracts.  Interest rate
              swap agreements and foreign currency  exchange  contracts are used
              to  mitigate   interest  rate  and  foreign  currency   exposures.
              Collateral   is   generally   not  required  for  these  types  of
              instruments.

              For debt excluding  capital leases,  the carrying amounts and fair
              values were $28.9 billion and $28.3 billion, respectively, at June
              30, 1999.

              AT&T has a $20  billion  commitment  from  multiple  lenders  with
              credit  agreements  to  be  finalized  upon  consummation  of  the
              proposed merger with the MediaOne Group Inc. (MediaOne).

              We  have  entered  into  a $1  billion  agreement  with  Convergys
              Corporation  to extend the term of our current  billing  agreement
              through 2004.

 (i)          SEGMENT REPORTING
              AT&T's  results are  segmented  according to the way we manage our
              business:  business services, consumer services, wireless services
              and broadband & Internet  services.  Our existing segments reflect
              certain  managerial  changes  since  the  publication  of our 1998
              annual  results.  The  business  services  segment was expanded to
              include the results of Teleport  Communications  Group Inc.  (TCG)
              and the business  portion of AT&T WorldNet  Service;  the consumer
              services  segment was expanded to include the residential  portion
              of  AT&T  WorldNet  Service  and the  costs  associated  with  the
              development of fixed wireless  technology.  All prior results have
              been restated to reflect these changes.  In addition,  as a result
              of our  merger  with TCI,  we  established  a new  segment  called
              broadband  & Internet  services.  Broadband  &  Internet  services
              includes  the results  associated  with  traditional  analog video
              service  as  well  as new  services  such  as  Digital  Cable  and
              AT&T@Home,  a high-speed cable Internet service.  Also included in
              this segment are the  operations  associated  with  developing and
              refining the infrastructure that will support broadband telephony.

              Reflecting the dynamics of our business,  we  continuously  review
              our management model and structure, which may result in additional
              adjustments to our operating segments in the future.

(j)           SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

              On August 2, 1999,  AT&T  completed  its  acquisition  of Honolulu
              Cellular Telephone Company from BellSouth.

              On August 5, 1999,  AT&T and BT  announced  that they will jointly
              acquire a 33% stake in Rogers  Cantel Mobile  Communications  Inc.
              (Rogers  Cantel) for  approximately  $934 in cash.  The investment
              will be owned  equally by AT&T and BT. AT&T and BT also  announced
              that BT will acquired 30% of AT&T's 31% ownership interest in AT&T
              Canada for approximately $402. In addition, Rogers Cantel and AT&T
              Canada will  accelerate the bundling and joint  marketing of wired
              and wireless services for Canadian business customers. The closing
              of these  transactions  is  expected  to take place in late August
              1999.

                       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
The merger  with  Tele-Communications,  Inc.  (TCI) was  completed  in the first
quarter of 1999 in an all stock transaction valued at approximately $52 billion.
AT&T  issued  approximately  664  million  shares in the  transaction,  of which
approximately  149 million were treasury  shares.  Also in  connection  with the
merger of TCI in the first  quarter of 1999,  and the formation of Liberty Media
Group  from  TCI's  former  programming  business  and  technology   investments
business, AT&T issued a separate tracking stock designed to reflect the separate
economic  performance  of Liberty  Media  Group.  A total of 540 million  shares
(1,080  million  shares on a  post-split  basis) of Class A Liberty  Media Group
Tracking Stock and 55 million shares (110 million shares on a post-split  basis)
of Class B Liberty  Media Group  Tracking  Stock were issued by AT&T.  AT&T also
issued 30 million Class A Liberty Media Group tracking shares (60 million shares
on a post-split basis) in connection with the conversion of certain  convertible
notes.  AT&T does not have a  controlling  financial  interest in Liberty  Media
Group,  therefore it has been  reflected as an equity  method  investment in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.  The results  attributable to
Liberty Media Group are  reflected as separate  line items  "Equity  losses from
Liberty  Media  Group"  and  "Investment  in  Liberty  Media  Group and  related
receivables"  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.  As  a
separate  tracking stock, all of the earnings or losses related to Liberty Media
Group are  excluded  from the  earnings  available to the holders of AT&T common
stock.

The merger  with TCI was  recorded  as a purchase.  Accordingly,  the  operating
results of TCI have been  included in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  since the date of  acquisition.  For accounting  purposes the deemed
effective  date of the  acquisition  is March 1,  1999,  since the impact of thr
results from March 1, 1999,  through March 9, 1999, is deemed  immaterial to our
consolidated  results.  TCI's cable and certain other operations,  including its
ownership interest in At Home Corporation  (Excite@Home),  but excluding Liberty
Media  Group,  became  AT&T  broadband  & Internet  services  (AB&IS),  and were
combined  with the  existing  operations  of AT&T to form the AT&T Common  Stock
Group (AT&T Group).

We segment  our  results  based on how we manage  our  business.  The  following
businesses comprise AT&T Group: business services, consumer services,  broadband
&  Internet  services  and  wireless  services.  A  fifth  category,  other  and
corporate, includes the results of AT&T Solutions,  international operations and
ventures,  other corporate  operations,  overhead and eliminations.  Results are
discussed  for these five  categories  as well as for combined  AT&T Group.  The
discussion for the other and corporate category is further broken out to include
information  for AT&T  Solutions  (which  includes the results of the  Solutions
outsourcing  unit, the internal AT&T Information  Technology  Services unit, and
the results of the IBM Global  Network which was acquired in the second  quarter

Earnings  per share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to AT&T  common
shareowners  were $0.49 on a diluted  basis for the second  quarter of 1999,  up
from a loss of $0.06 in the  second  quarter  of 1998.  Earnings  per share from
continuing  operations  attributable to AT&T common  shareowners were $0.88 on a
diluted basis in the first half of 1999,  compared with $0.41 on a diluted basis
in the first half of 1998.  The increases  were due to lower  restructuring  and
other charges,  net and increased income from operations  attributable to higher
revenues and an improved cost structure.

AT&T Group's  operational  earnings  were $0.49 per diluted share for the second
quarter  of 1999,  a decrease  of 9.3%,  or $0.05,  over the prior year  period.
Operational EPS for the second quarter excludes:
 ..Net restructuring and other charges of $0.62 in 1998
 ..Gains on sales of business of $.02 in 1999 and 1998
 ..A  $0.02  benefit  in 1999  from  changes  in tax rules  with  respect  to the
utilization  of acquired net operating  losses ..A loss of $0.04  reflecting the
earnings impact of our investment in Excite@Home and Cablevison Systems Corp.
(Cablevision)

The decrease in operational  earnings for the second quarter is due primarily to
the impact of our merger with TCI.

Excluding  the  impacts  of both TCI and AGNS,  operational  EPS for the  second
quarter of 1999 was $0.75,  an increase of 38.9%,  or $0.21,  compared  with the
second  quarter of 1998.  The increase was primarily due to higher  revenues and
improving margins.

AT&T Group's  operational  earnings  were $1.09 per diluted  share for the first
half of 1999,  an  increase  of 9.0%,  or  $0.09,  over the prior  year  period.
Operational EPS for the first half excludes:
 ..Net restructuring and other charges of $0.22 in 1999 and $0.76 in 1998 ..Gains
on sales of businesses of $0.05 in 1999 and $0.17 in 1998
 ..A  $0.02  benefit  in 1999  from  changes  in tax rules  with  respect  to the
utilization  of acquired net operating  losses ..A loss of $0.06  reflecting the
earnings impact of our investment in Excite@Home and Cablevison.

The  increase in  operational  earnings  for the first half is due  primarily to
higher  revenues and improving  margins,  partially  offset by the impact of our
merger with TCI.

Excluding the impacts of both TCI and AGNS,  operational  EPS for the six months
ended June 30, 1999, was $1.42,  an increase of 42.0%,  or $0.42,  compared with
the prior year period primarily due to higher revenues and improving margins.

Liberty  Media  Group's loss per share was $0.43 for the quarter  ended June 30,
1999,  and $0.48 for the period from the date of  acquisition  through  June 30,
1999.

The  results of AT&T Group and  Liberty  Media  Group are  discussed  in further
detail below.

</TABLE>

Total  revenues  on a reported  basis  increased  18.8% to $15,691  million  and
increased  14.4% to $29,787  million for the three and  six-month  periods ended
June 30, 1999,  respectively,  compared with the respective  prior year periods.
Excluding  AB&IS and AGNS,  revenues  increased 6.4% to $14,057  million for the
second quarter of 1999 and increased 6.3% to $27,670  million for the first half
of 1999 compared with the comparable prior year periods.  The increases for both
periods were due to growth in wireless services, business data services and AT&T
Solution's  outsourcing  services,  partially offset by lower consumer  services
revenues.  Revenues  on a pro forma  basis,  which  include the results of AB&IS
(adjusted  to exclude all closed cable  partnerships  and  Excite@Home)  and the
impact of the closed  portions  of AGNS for a full period in both 1999 and 1998,
increased  6.7% for the second  quarter of 1999 and increased 6.5% for the first
half of 1999 compared with the corresponding prior year periods.

Access and other  interconnection  expenses decreased $226 million,  or 5.8%, to

1998. Access and other interconnection expenses decreased $430 million, or 5.5%,
to $7,400  million  in the first  half of 1999  compared  with the first half of
1998.  The  declines  primarily  relate to  FCC-mandated  access  reform,  lower
negotiated international settlement rates and more efficient use of the network.
Business long distance volume growth partially offset the decreases.

</TABLE>
Network and other communications  services expenses increased $1,222 million, or
47.9%,  to $3,774  million in the second  quarter of 1999 compared with the same
period last year. Network and other  communications  services expenses increased
$1,548  million,  or 30.4%, to $6,646 million in the first half of 1999 compared
with the same period last year. Excluding the impacts of AB&IS and AGNS, network
and other  communications  services  expenses  increased  11.6% and 7.6% for the
three and six-month periods ended June 30, 1999, respectively, compared with the
same periods last year.  These  increases  were  primarily  associated  with the
growing  wireless  subscriber  base largely  attributable to the success of AT&T
Digital  One Rate  service  which has  resulted  in higher  off-network  roaming
charges and higher costs and volume of  handsets.  A portion of the increase was
also  due to  growth  in AT&T  Solutions.  For the  year-to-date  period,  these
increases  were  partially  offset  by lower  nonincome  taxes,  lower  per-call
compensation  expense due to a favorable FCC ruling in the first quarter of 1999
and a lower provision for uncollectibles for business and consumer services.

241.5%,  for the six months ended June 30, 1999,  compared with the same periods
last year.  The increases were primarily  driven by the TCI  acquisition.  Other
purchased  intangibles  arising from  business  combinations  primarily  include
customer  lists,  franchise  costs and licenses.  AT&T also has  amortization of
goodwill associated with nonconsolidated  investments recorded as a component of
other income (expense)  amounting to $152 million and $192 million for the three

and AGNS, depreciation and other amortization expenses increased 22.1% and 21.7%
for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 1999, respectively,  compared
with the  respective  prior year periods.  The increases  were  primarily due to
growth  in  AT&T  Group's   depreciable  asset  base  resulting  from  continued
infrastructure  investment  throughout  1998.  Capital  expenditures  were  $3.0
billion for the three months  ended June 30, 1999,  and $4.4 billion for the six
months ended June 30, 1999. The capital expenditures for both periods focused on
data, cable operations, wireless services and business local services.

3.4%, to $3,461  million in the second quarter of 1999 and decreased $7 million,
or  0.1%,  to  $6,618  million  for the  first  half of 1999  compared  with the
respective prior year periods.  Excluding AB&IS and AGNS, SG&A expenses declined
8.2% for the  second  quarter  of 1999 and  declined  6.6% for the first half of
1999, versus the respective year-ago periods. These decreases were primarily due
to  savings  from  headcount  reductions  and other  cost  control  initiatives.
Including  AB&IS and AGNS,  SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 22.1%
and 22.2% for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 1999, respectively,
compared with 25.3% and 25.4% in the year-ago periods.  SG&A expenses  excluding
wireless  services and the consumer  local  business as a percentage of revenues

</TABLE>
Restructuring  and other  charges,  net were a pretax benefit of $29 million for
the second quarter of 1999.  The benefit  included a $68 million pretax net gain
primarily related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would have competed
directly with the global venture AT&T is forming with British Telecommunications
plc (BT).  Also included was an $11 million  pretax gain from the  settlement of
pension  obligations from AT&T's voluntary  retirement  incentive program offer.
Partially offsetting these gains was a $50 million pretax charge recorded in the
second  quarter of 1999  related to the  estimated  losses that are  expected to
result from a  contribution  agreement TCI entered into with  Phoenixstar,  Inc.
(Phoenixstar),  formerly Primestar,  Inc., a previous equity investment.  To the
extent  necessary,  the company is required to satisfy  certain  liabilities  of
Phoenixstar.  The remaining  obligation under this contribution  agreement which
expires in 2001 is $26 million.

Second  quarter 1998  restructuring  and other  charges,  net of $2,743  million
pretax,  or a reduction  of  approximately  $0.62 per diluted  share,  primarily
related to charges associated with AT&T's voluntary retirement incentive program
offer.

Restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the six months  ended June 30, 1999,
were $702  million  pretax,  or a reduction of  approximately  $0.22 per diluted
share.  Included in this  balance was an  in-process  research  and  development
charge of $594 million  pretax  related to the TCI  acquisition,  a $128 million
pretax net charge  primarily  related to the exit of certain joint ventures that
would have competed directly with the global venture AT&T is forming with BT and
the $50 million pretax charge related to the Phoenixstar  agreement noted above.
These charges were partially  offset by a $70 million pretax gain related to the
settlement  of pension  obligations  for former  employees  who accepted  AT&T's
voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

The in-process  research and  development  projects  related to TCI's efforts to
offer voice over Internet  protocol,  cost savings  efforts for cable  telephony
implementation and product integration efforts for advanced set-top devices that
would enable TCI to offer next-generation  digital services.  Although there are
significant  technological issues to overcome in order to successfully  complete
the acquired  in-process  research  and  development,  AT&T  expects  successful
completion.  AT&T  currently  anticipates  that (i) it will deploy  equipment to
offer voice over  Internet  protocol to two cities in the year 2001,  (ii) field
deployable devices will be available by the end of the year with respect to

AT&T's cost savings efforts for cable telephony implementation,  and (iii) field
trials will begin in mid-year 2000 for  next-generation  digital  services.  If,
however,  AT&T is unable to establish  technological  feasibility  and produce a
commercially viable  product/service,  then anticipated  incremental future cash
flows attributable to expected profits from such new  product/service may not be
realized.

Restructuring  and other  charges,  net for the six months  ended June 30, 1998,
were $3,344 million pretax,  or a reduction of  approximately  $0.76 per diluted
share.  The charge is  comprised of a first  quarter 1999 pretax  charge of $601
million which resulted from the decision not to pursue Total Service Resale as a
local-service  strategy as well as the second  quarter $2,743 million net pretax
charge primarily related to AT&T's voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

</TABLE>
For the three months ended June 30, 1999, other income (expense)  decreased $381
million,  or 124.2%,  to an expense of $74 million compared with $307 million of
income in the second  quarter of 1998.  The  decrease  primarily  resulted  from
equity  losses and goodwill  amortization  associated  with our  nonconsolidated
investments in Excite@Home and  Cablevision.  Also  contributing to the decrease
was a 1998 second  quarter  pretax gain of $103  million on the sale of SmarTone
Telecommunications  Holdings  Limited  (SmarTone) and higher  interest income in
1998 on the proceeds  received from the sale of Universal  Card Services  (UCS).
These decreases were partially  offset by an $88 million pretax gain on the sale
of WOOD-TV in the second quarter of 1999.

Other income  (expense)  decreased  $938  million,  or 92.6%,  to $75 million of
income for the six months ended June 30, 1999,  compared with $1,013  million of
income in the first six months of 1998.  The decrease was due  primarily to 1998
pretax  gains on the  sales  of AT&T  Solutions  Customer  Care  (ASCC)  and LIN
Television Corp. (LIN-TV) of $350 million and $317 million,  respectively, and a
pretax gain on the sale of SmarTone of $103 million.  Also  contributing  to the
decrease  were  equity  losses and  goodwill  amortization  associated  with our
nonconsolidated investments in Excite@Home and Cablevision. Partially offsetting
these  decreases  was a 1999 first quarter gain on the sale of the AT&T Language
Line Services business (Language Line) of $153 million pretax, and a 1999 second
quarter gain on the sale of WOOD-TV of $88 million pretax.

1999, interest expense increased $441 million, or 212.6%,  compared with the six
months ended June 30, 1998.  These  increases were primarily  driven by a higher
level of average debt outstanding  associated with our  acquisitions,  partially
offset by a lower average interest rate.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes. $  877   $ (119)   $1,903   $  626
</TABLE>
The provision  for income taxes for the second  quarter of 1999  increased  $996
million compared with the second quarter of 1998. The effective tax rate for the
quarter  was 35.6%,  down from 42.9% in the second  quarter of 1998.  During the
second quarter of 1999 a change in the net operating loss  utilization tax rules
resulted in a $75 million reduction in the current quarter income tax provision.
Excluding  the  impacts  of this  change,  as well as the  second  quarter  1998
restructuring charges, the effective tax rates in the second quarter of 1999 and
1998 were  38.6%  and  37.7%,  respectively.  The  increase  in the rate was due
primarily to higher non-tax deductible goodwill  amortization in 1999 as well as
the tax impacts of certain  1998 asset  dispositions  and foreign  legal  entity
restructurings.

The provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 1999, increased
$1,277  million  compared with the same period 1998.  The effective tax rate for
the six months ended June 30, 1999,  was 41.7%,  up from 35.7% for the first six
months of 1998.  In the first  quarter of 1999,  AT&T  Group  recorded a non-tax
deductible  in-process research and development charge, and accordingly,  no tax
benefit was recorded.  Excluding  the impacts of this charge,  the change in the
net operating loss utilization tax rules as well as the 1998  restructuring  and
other  charges,  the effective tax rates were 38.3% and 37.4% for the six months
ended June 30,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The  increase in the rate was due
primarily to higher non-tax deductible goodwill amortization in 1999.

In April 1998 AT&T sold UCS for $3,500  million,  resulting in an after-tax gain
of  $1,290  million,  or  $0.48  per  share,  reflected  as  "Gain  on  Sale  of
Discontinued Operations" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Income available to AT&T shareowners increased $459 million, or 40.5%, to $1,588
million in the second quarter of 1999,  driven by lower  restructuring and other
charges, increased income from operations attributable to higher revenues and an
improved cost structure and the positive impact of changes in net operating loss
utilization  tax  rules.  These  were  partially  offset  by the gain on sale of
discontinued  operations in 1998 and the equity losses during the current period
related to Excite@Home and  Cablevision.  Income  available to AT&T  shareowners
increased  $240 million,  or 9.9%, to $2,664  million for the first half of 1999
driven  by  lower  restructuring  and  other  charges,   increased  income  from
operations  attributable  to higher  revenues and an improved cost structure and
the positive  impact of changes in net  operating  loss  utilization  tax rules.
These were partially  offset by the gain on sale of  discontinued  operations in
1998,  lower gains on sales of  businesses in 1999 and the equity losses for the
first half of the year related to Excite@Home and Cablevision.

AT&T GROUP SEGMENT RESULTS

Business Services
The business  services  segment results reflect sales of long distance and local
voice  and  data  services  to  business   customers,   including  domestic  and
international,   inbound  and  outbound,   intra-LATA  toll,  calling  card  and
operator-handled  services and other network enabled services. This segment also
includes electronic commerce and  Internet-protocol  (IP) for business customers
such as Web site hosting and AT&T WorldNet business Internet access.

Consumer Services
The   consumer    services   segment   includes   the   results   of   providing
telecommunications  services to  residential  customers  including  domestic and
international long distance services, intra-LATA toll services, calling-card and
operator-handled  calling services, and prepaid calling cards. In addition, this
segment  includes AT&T WorldNet  residential  Internet access service,  noncable
local services  provided to residential  customers and the costs associated with
the development of fixed wireless technology.

Wireless Services
The  results  of this  segment  are  comprised  primarily  of sales of  wireless
services and products to customers in AT&T Group's 850 MHz  (cellular)  and 1900
MHz (PCS) markets.  The results of AT&T's former messaging business are included
in 1998 results through October 2, when the unit was sold.

Broadband & Internet Services
This segment reflects operations  associated with providing services through the
broadband  network acquired as a result of AT&T's merger with TCI. This includes
the results  associated with  traditional  analog video service,  as well as new
services,  such as Digital  Cable and  AT&T@Home,  a high-speed  cable  Internet
access service. AT&T@Home, along with several other large cable operators, has a
contract with Excite@Home, the operator of an Internet "backbone", over which we
can provide high-speed cable Internet service. Also included in this segment are
the operations  associated with developing and refining the infrastructure  that
will support broadband telephony.

Other and Corporate
This  group   includes  the  results  of  AT&T   Solutions   (including   AGNS),
international operations and ventures, other corporate operations,  overhead and
eliminations.

The above segments  reflect  certain changes since the publication of our annual
results due to changes in the way we manage our business.  The business services
segment was  expanded to include  the results of Teleport  Communications  Group
Inc.  (TCG) and the  business  portion of AT&T  WorldNet  Service;  the consumer
services  segment  was  expanded  to  include  the  residential  portion of AT&T
WorldNet Service and the costs associated with the development of fixed wireless
technology. All prior results have been restated to reflect these changes.

The discussion of segment  results for AT&T Group generally  includes  revenues;
earnings  before  interest and taxes,  including  other income (EBIT);  earnings
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization,  including other income
(EBITDA);  capital additions and total assets. The discussion of EBITDA for AT&T
Group's wireless services and broadband & Internet services segments is modified
to exclude other income.

AT&T calculates EBIT as operating income plus other income and is a measure used
by our chief operating  decision-makers to measure AT&T's consolidated operating
results and to measure segment  profitability.  Interest and taxes are generally
not allocated to our segments because debt is managed and serviced and taxes are
managed and calculated on a centralized basis.  Trends in interest and taxes are
discussed  separately on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes EBIT is a
meaningful  measure to disclose to investors because it provides  investors with
an analysis  of  operating  results  using the same  measures  used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of AT&T,  provides a return on total  capitalization
measure,  and allows investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each
segment in relation to consolidated AT&T. Our calculation of EBIT may or may not
be consistent with the calculation of EBIT by other public  companies,  and EBIT
should  not be viewed by  investors  as an  alternative  to  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (GAAP) measures of income as a measure of performance or
to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity.

EBITDA is also used by  management  as a measure of segment  performance  and is
defined as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization.  We believe it is meaningful
to investors as a measure of each  segment's  liquidity and allows  investors to
evaluate a segment's  liquidity using the same measure that is used by the chief
operating  decision-makers  of AT&T.  Consolidated  EBITDA is also  provided for
comparison purposes. Our calculation of EBITDA may or may not be consistent with
the calculation of EBITDA by other public  companies and should not be viewed by
investors  as an  alternative  to  GAAP  measures  of  income  as a  measure  of
performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities
as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into effect changes
in certain assets and liabilities which can affect cash flow.

Total  assets  for  each  segment  include  all  assets,   except   inter-entity
receivables.  Deferred taxes,  prepaid pension assets,  and  corporate-owned  or
leased real estate are generally  held at the corporate  level and therefore are
included in the other and corporate  group.  Shared network assets are allocated
to the  segments and  reallocated  each  January,  based on the prior two years'
volumes of minutes used.

Capital  additions  for each segment  include  additions to property,  plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets including licenses, investments, franchise
costs and capitalized software.

REVENUES
Business  services  revenues  increased  6.7% in the second quarter of 1999, and
increased  7.1% for the first six months of 1999  compared  with the prior year.
The increase for the quarter was primarily driven by continued  strength in data
services and local voice services.  The increase for the year-to-date period was
primarily  driven by data  services,  domestic long distance  voice services and
local voice services.  Total calling  volumes for both periods,  including local
services,  increased  about 25% over the prior year;  excluding  local services,
volumes maintained a mid-teens growth rate for both periods.

Data  services  revenues  increased  by  more  than  20%  for  the  quarter  and
year-to-date  periods  led by  continued  growth in frame  relay and  high-speed
private line services partly due to continued customer demand for high-bandwidth
(OC-X)  capabilities.  The data  services  growth was  augmented by  significant
growth in IP services such as WorldNet and virtual private  network  services to
business customers.  Data growth was approximately 20% for the second quarter of
1999 compared with the prior year second  quarter when adjusted for AT&T's frame
relay service interruption in April 1998.

Long  distance  voice  revenues grew at a  low-single-digit  rate for the second
quarter  and for the first six  months of 1999.  Strong  volume  increases  were
partially  offset by a declining  average  price per minute.  Average  price per
minute  has been  negatively  impacted  by the  competitive  forces  within  the
industry  which we expect to continue.  In  addition,  price per minute has been
negatively impacted by changes in product mix.

Local voice service  revenues,  which  included  domestic ACC revenues since its
acquisition  in April,  1998,  grew over 45% in the second quarter and grew over
65% for the first  half of 1999,  compared  with the  corresponding  prior  year
periods.  AT&T's integrated  business local  operations,  including AT&T Digital
Link,  added  approximately  105 thousand  access  lines in the second  quarter,
bringing total access lines in service to approximately  868 thousand as of June
30, 1999.  AT&T serves 26,723  buildings in 87  metropolitan  statistical  areas
(MSAs), up from 16,537 a year ago, with over 20% of the buildings on-net.

Internal  revenues  increased 91.4% and 59.7% for the three and six months ended
June 30, 1999, respectively.  The increases were due to higher sales of business
long  distance  services  to other AT&T  units,  primarily  AT&T  Solutions  and
wireless services, for resale to AT&T Solutions and wireless services customers.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA for business services increased to $1,459 million, or 30.4%, and
to $2,202  million,  or  28.7%,  respectively,  in the  second  quarter  of 1999
compared  with the  year-ago  quarter.  EBIT and  EBITDA for  business  services
increased  to  $3,026  million,  or  34.9%,  and to  $4,458  million,  or 32.6%,
respectively, for the first six months of 1999 compared with the prior year. The
increases were due to revenue growth and associated margin improvement.

additions  increased $319 million, or 14.6%, for the first half of 1999 compared
with the first half of 1998. The increase for both periods was primarily  driven
by the  expansion  of SONET,  in  support of data and IP,  and  business  local,
partially offset by lower capital spending on circuit switched equipment.

Total assets  increased  $979 million,  or 4.6%, to $22,394  million at June 30,
1999, compared with December 31, 1998, primarily due to an increase in property,
plant and  equipment as a result of capital  additions  and  increased  accounts
receivable associated with higher revenues.

REVENUES
Consumer  services  revenues  decreased  3.4% for both the three  and  six-month
periods ended June 30, 1999, compared with the same periods last year. Excluding
AT&T  WorldNet  services,  revenues  were  down  3.9% and 3.8% for the three and
six-month periods ended June 30, 1999, respectively, while long distance calling
volumes  declined at a  mid-single-digit  rate for both  periods.  These results
reflect the competitive nature of the consumer long distance  industry,  and the
continued  impact  of AT&T's  strategy  to  migrate  higher-usage  customers  to
optional calling plans in order to optimize the customer base for future growth.

Two key elements of AT&T's  strategy are to grow  revenues  through  transaction
services  and to bundle  services to attract  and retain  high usage  customers.
AT&T's  transaction  services  continue to grow rapidly led by prepaid services,
whose growth in the second  quarter was enhanced by the  acquisition  of certain
assets of SmarTalk TeleServices (SmartTalk). AT&T's bundled offer, AT&T Personal
Network Service, offers long distance,  wireless, calling card, and personal 800
services at a single rate per minute,  plus WorldNet Internet access, all on one
integrated  bill.   Personal   Network  has  seen  a  positive   response  since
introduction   in  the  first  quarter  of  1999  and  now  has  nearly  250,000
subscribers.

Consumer  WorldNet  services  revenues  increased 55.0% in the second quarter of
1999 over the year-ago quarter to $76 million.  Revenues increased 48.1% for the
first half of 1999 to $141 million  compared  with the first half of 1998.  AT&T
WorldNet services now serves approximately 1.5 million residential  subscribers,
an increase of 45% from a year ago.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA for consumer services  increased 20.2% and 20.3%,  respectively,
in the second  quarter of 1999 compared with the second quarter of last year and
increased  30.7% and 29.6%,  respectively,  for the first half of 1999  compared
with  the  first  half of last  year.  EBIT and  EBITDA  for  consumer  services
excluding the first quarter gain on the sale of Language  Line  increased  25.3%
and 24.8%,  respectively,  for the first half of 1999 over the same  period last
year. The increases for both the quarter and year-to-date  periods excluding the
gain on the sale of Language  Line were  driven  primarily  by lower  negotiated
settlement rates and cost reduction efforts, primarily in marketing spending.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital additions for consumer services increased $70 million, or 87.2%, for the
second  quarter of 1999 compared with the second  quarter of 1998.  The increase
was  primarily due to greater  capital  expenditures  to expand  AT&T's  network
infrastructure. Capital additions increased $59 million, or 30.0%, for the first
half of 1999  compared  with the first half of 1998.  The increase was primarily
due to increased capitalized software and greater capital expenditures to expand
AT&T's network infrastructure.

Total assets  increased  $126  million,  or 1.9%,  to $6,687  million  primarily
associated with the purchase of SmartTalk in the first quarter.

REVENUES
Wireless  services  revenues  increased  $565 million,  or 43.1%,  in the second
quarter of 1999,  and increased  $963 million,  or 38.9%,  for the first half of
1999  compared  with same  periods  last year.  Wireless  services  1999 results
include  Vanguard  Cellular  Systems  (Vanguard) since its acquisition on May 3,
1999,  and 1998 results  include our messaging  business  until the sale date of
October 2, 1998.  Adjusted to exclude both Vanguard and our messaging  business,
revenues grew 42.4% and 41.3% for the three and six-month periods ended June 30,
1999,  respectively,  compared with the prior year periods.  The growth for both
periods was driven by the  continued  successful  execution  of AT&T's  wireless
strategy of  targeting  and  retaining  high-value  subscribers,  expanding  the
national wireless  footprint,  focusing on digital service,  and offering simple
rate plans. AT&T's Digital One Rate service leverages all of the elements of the
wireless  strategy and  continues  to generate  significant  revenue  growth and
contribute  positively  to EBITDA.  The number of AT&T  Digital One Rate service
subscribers  grew to nearly 1.5 million in the second quarter of 1999, with over
80% of the net  additions  representing  new  wireless  customers  for AT&T.  In
addition,  during the quarter, AT&T introduced Group Calling for business, which
offers  simplicity and value with  unlimited  calling for a flat fee for "closed
user groups".

AT&T  continues to  experience  strong  growth in wireless  subscribers  and net
subscriber  additions.  Consolidated net additions increased 45.5% in the second
quarter of 1999 versus the second quarter of 1998 to over 473 thousand, bringing
consolidated subscribers,  including approximately 700 thousand subscribers from
our acquisition of Vanguard, to a total of approximately 8.8 million at June 30,
1999,  up 35.4%  from a year  ago and up  15.9%  from  one  quarter  ago.  Total
subscribers,  including  partnership  markets  in  which  AT&T  does  not  own a
controlling interest, exceeded 11 million in the second quarter.

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

AT&T's  focus on  high-value  subscribers  has helped  generate  rising usage by
customers and increased  quarterly average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU across
all of AT&T's wireless  markets was $66.2 in the second quarter,  an increase of
15.3% from the second quarter of 1998 and a 9.2% increase from the first quarter
of 1999. This represents the third  consecutive  quarter ARPU has increased over
the prior year.

We continue to rapidly  migrate  customers to digital  service,  generating more
efficient use of the network while also reducing  customer  churn. At the end of
the second quarter, 69.0% of AT&T's 8.8 million consolidated subscribers were on
digital service, up from 45.2% one year ago and up from 67.3% one quarter ago.

EBIT/EBITDA EXCLUDING OTHER INCOME
EBIT was $52 million and $24 million for the three and six months ended June 30,
1999, respectively,  representing decreases of 73.7% and 88.7% over the year ago
periods.  The EBIT decline for both periods was primarily due to increased costs
from higher off-network  roaming expenses,  and increased  customer  acquisition
costs associated with the high growth of subscriber additions. In addition, EBIT
was also impacted by higher other income in 1998 due to the second  quarter gain
on the sale of SmarTone. EBITDA excluding other income was $329 million and $531
million,  for the  three  and six  months  ended  June 30,  1999,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 18.3%  and 9.2%  over  the  year  ago  periods.  The
improvement for both periods was the result of revenue growth,  partially offset
by increased costs from higher off-network roaming expenses and greater customer
acquisition costs associated with the high growth of subscriber additions.

Off-network  roaming expenses  continued to negatively impact results,  but have
been favorably  impacted as a result of  aggressively  capturing more minutes on
the AT&T network as well as reducing  intercarrier roaming rates. AT&T continues
to  address  off-network  usage  through  capital  expansion,  acquisitions  and
affiliate  launches.  Capital  expansion  is underway  within  existing  and new
markets,  including Columbus,  Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; San Diego,  California and
certain Connecticut cities. In May 1999, AT&T completed it merger with Vanguard,
adding  more  than 700  thousand  subscribers  and  increasing  AT&T's  wireless
coverage in suburban and rural markets in the Ohio Valley and Northeastern  U.S.
In addition,  the announced acquisition of Honolulu Cellular closed on August 2,
1999. Partnership  affiliations with Cincinnati Bell Wireless,  Triton, Telecorp
and Tritel further expand AT&T's Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) footprint.
Intercarrier  roaming  rates  have also  declined  as a result  of  renegotiated
roaming  agreements and the deployment of Intelligent  Roaming  Database  (IRDB)
technology, which assists in identifying favorable roaming partners in areas not
included in our wireless network.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  increased $408 million,  or 164.8%, in the second quarter of
1999, compared with the second quarter of 1998. Capital additions increased $422
million,  or 106.6% in the first half of 1999,  compared  with the first half of
1998.  These  increases  were the result of  additional  spending to upgrade and
increase capacity in existing markets.

Total assets increased $2,273 million,  or 11.9%, to $21,388 million at June 30,
1999,  from  December 31, 1998.  The increase was due  primarily to increases in
goodwill,  property, plant and equipment and licensing costs associated with our
acquisitions  of  Vanguard  and  Bakersfield  Cellular.  In  addition,  accounts
receivable were higher partially attributable to increased revenues.

ago.  Revenues  for the first  half of 1999  excluding  the  impacts of the AGNS
acquisition were $743 million, an increase of 41.7% compared with the first half
of last year.  Revenue  growth for both  periods  was  primarily  driven by AT&T
Solutions as a result of the  continued  strength of the  outsourcing  business.
International  operations  and ventures also  contributed  to the revenue growth
primarily  due to an  increase in  reorigination  and  transit  revenues.  These
increases  were  partially   offset  by  an  increase  in  the   elimination  of
intercompany revenues. Additionally,  revenue growth for the year-to-date period
was partially offset by the sale of ASCC in March 1998.

The elimination of revenues and profit generated by the sale of services between
business  segments is primarily a result of the sale of business  long  distance
services to other AT&T units.  Revenues  eliminated  in the second  quarter were
$401 million, an increase of 85.2% from the second quarter of 1998 and were $697
million  for the first six months of 1999,  an  increase  of 40.6% over the same
period  last  year.  The  increases  over 1998 were  primarily  due to  business
services sales to AT&T Solutions and wireless services.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA  were $37 million  and $202  million  for the second  quarter of
1999, representing increases of 101.2% and 107.0%, respectively, over the second
quarter of 1998. EBIT and EBITDA were deficits of $430 million and $140 million,
respectively,  for the  first  half of 1999  compared  with  deficits  of $3,344
million and $3,108 million in the same period of 1998.  Excluding  restructuring
and other charges for both periods and the second  quarter 1999 gain on the sale
of WOOD-TV and first  quarter  1998 gains on the sales of ASCC and LIN-TV,  EBIT
was a deficit of $130 million and EBITDA was $35 million for the second  quarter
of 1999, an improvement of 51.6% and 122.6%,  respectively,  over the comparable
prior year  period.  EBIT was a deficit of $460 million and EBITDA was a deficit
of $170 million for the first half of 1999 on this same basis, an improvement of
31.2% and  60.8%,  respectively,  over the  comparable  prior year  period.  The
improvements  for both periods were  primarily due to lower  corporate  expenses
driven by cost cutting initiatives such as headcount  reductions.  Additionally,
the   year-to-date   improvement   was  impacted  by  lower  equity  losses  for
international  partnerships  and  ventures.  The increases for both periods were
partially offset by higher interest income in 1998.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions were  essentially flat in the second quarter of 1999 compared
with the second quarter of last year. Capital additions  increased $287 million,
or 109.9% for the first six months of 1999 compared with the first six months of
1998 primarily due to increased investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

Total  assets at June 30,  1999,  were  $16,646  million  compared  with $12,459
million at December 31, 1998,  which  represents a 33.6% increase.  The increase
was primarily due to goodwill  associated with the acquisition of the IBM Global
Network.

AT&T SOLUTIONS
AT&T Solutions is our outsourcing,  network-management and professional-services
business.  AT&T  Solutions is comprised of the Solutions  outsourcing  unit, the
internal AT&T Information  Technology  Services unit, and the recently  acquired
portions of the IBM Global Network.  During the second  quarter,  AT&T completed
the US, Japan,  Ireland,  and UK portions of the IBM acquisition and renamed the
unit AT&T Global  Network  Services  (AGNS).  The results of AT&T  Solutions are
included in the other and corporate group.

REVENUES
AT&T  Solutions  grew revenues  161.3% for the second quarter of 1999 and 109.4%
for the first six  months of 1999  compared  with the  corresponding  prior year
periods.  Excluding the impact of AGNS,  revenues grew 49.8% for the quarter and
50.5% for the first six  months of 1999.  The growth  for both  periods  was the
result  of  continued  strength  in  outsourcing  services.  In  addition,  AT&T
Solutions   manages  AT&T's  internal  network   infrastructure   and  generated
approximately  $423 million and $852 million in internal  billings in the second
quarter and for the first six months of 1999, respectively,  which were recorded
as a reduction to AT&T Solutions' expenses (cost recovery).

AT&T  Solutions,  with more  than  30,000  clients,  including  IBM,  CitiGroup,
McGraw-Hill, Bank One, United Health Group, Textron, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch,
and  MasterCard  International,  has the  potential for more than $11 billion in
outsourcing revenues over the life of the signed contracts.  During the quarter,
AT&T Solutions also added Safeco,  American  Century and Teachers  Insurance and
Annuity Association as clients.

EBIT/EBITDA
Excluding  the impact of AGNS,  EBIT and EBITDA were $10 million and $82 million
for the second quarter of 1999, respectively, an improvement over $5 million and
$73 million reported in the  corresponding  prior year quarter.  EBIT and EBITDA
were $21 million and $166  million on this basis for the first half of 1999,  an
improvement  over a deficit of $4 million  and a  positive  $131  million in the
first half of 1998.  The  improvement  for both  periods  was  primarily  due to
revenue growth in the existing AT&T Solutions' outsourcing unit partially offset
by higher expenses driven by the higher revenues.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions for the second quarter of 1999 were $65 million,  an increase
of 94.1% over the second  quarter of 1998.  Capital  additions for the first six
months of 1999 were $76  million,  an increase  of 34.3% over the  corresponding
prior year period.  The increases  were  primarily due to the addition of client
support equipment.

Total assets  increased $4,372 million,  or 427.3%,  from December 31, 1998, due
primarily to goodwill associated with the acquisition of the IBM Global Network.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND VENTURES
International  operations and ventures include  consolidated  foreign operations
such  as  AT&T   Communications   Services  UK  (Comms  UK),  ACC,  transit  and
reorigination  businesses and international online services. The equity earnings
or losses of AT&T's nonconsolidated  international joint ventures and alliances,
such as Alestra in Mexico and AT&T Canada Corp. are also included. As of June 1,
1999, AT&T Canada Corp.  completed its merger with MetroNet  Communication Corp.
(MetroNet), Canada's largest facilities-based competitive local exchange carrier
(CLEC). AT&T now owns 31% of the combined company, AT&T Canada, and continues to
account for its ownership as an equity investment.  These results do not include
bilateral  international  long distance traffic,  which is reflected in business
services and consumer  services,  as appropriate.  The results of  international
operations and ventures are included in the other and corporate group.

REVENUES
Revenues grew 22.2% in the second quarter of 1999 to $333 million and grew 38.7%
to $625  million in the first six months of 1999  compared  with the  respective
prior year periods. Revenue growth for both periods was led by reorigination and
transit/interconnection  due to increased demand and the addition of new traffic
routes. The growth for the year-to-date period was also impacted by improvements
in frame relay and wholesale growth, and the purchase of ACC in April 1998.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT and EBITDA  improved in the second quarter of 1999 by $123 million and $121
million,  respectively,  compared with the corresponding  prior year periods due
primarily to a net gain related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would
have  competed  directly  with  the  global  venture  AT&T is  forming  with BT.
Excluding the net gain,  EBIT and EBITDA  improved in the second quarter of 1999
by $55  million  and $53  million,  respectively,  due  primarily  to  improving
financial  performance in our  nonconsolidated  ventures and  alliances,  strong
revenues and volume growth in reorigination  and  transit/interconnect  services
and cost reduction efforts.

EBIT and  EBITDA  each  declined  in the first  half of 1999 by $63  million  to
deficits of $189 million and $151 million,  respectively.  The declines were due
primarily  to the 1999 net  charge  related to the exit of joint  ventures  that
would have competed  directly  with the global  venture AT&T is forming with BT.
Excluding the charges, EBIT and EBITDA improved during the period by $65 million
each,  due  primarily  to  improving  financial   performance  in  ventures  and
alliances,   strong   revenues   and   volume   growth  in   reorigination   and
transit/interconnect  services,  improved  performance  in the  frame  relay and
wholesale arenas and cost reduction efforts.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  were  essentially  flat for the  second  quarter of 1999 and
increased $292 million for the first six months of 1999,  compared with the same
periods last year. The increases were primarily due to increased  investments in
nonconsolidated subsidiaries.

Total assets were $2,599 million at June 30, 1999,  compared with $1,915 million
at December  31,  1998.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven by an increase in
goodwill  due to our  investment  in  AT&T  Canada,  additional  investments  in
consolidated  subsidiaries and a higher cash balance associated with the gain on
sale of non-strategic investments in the second quarter.

LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP RESULTS
Liberty  Media  Group   produces,   acquires  and   distributes   entertainment,
educational and informational programming services through all available formats
and media. Liberty Media Group is also engaged in electronic retailing services,
direct marketing services,  advertising sales relating to programming  services,
infomercials and transaction processing.  Although Liberty Media Group is wholly
owned by AT&T, it is accounted for as an equity  investment in the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  since  AT&T  does  not  have a  controlling
financial  interest in Liberty  Media Group.  Equity  losses from Liberty  Media
Group were $543 million for the second  quarter of 1999 and $601 million for the
period from the date of acquisition through June 30, 1999.

</FN>
</TABLE>
Net cash provided by operating  activities of continuing  operations for the six
months ended June 30, 1999, was $3,401  million.  This  represents a decrease of
$631 million compared with the first six months of 1998. The decrease was driven
primarily by an increase in the 1999 tax payments of approximately  $1.4 billion
primarily  related to the gain on the sale of UCS and an  increase  in  accounts
receivable,  partially  offset by an increase in operating net income  excluding
depreciation and amortization.

AT&T's investing  activities resulted in a net use of cash of $16,390 million in
the first half of 1999 compared  with a net source of cash of $8,428  million in
the first half of 1998.  During the first six months of 1999,  AT&T  transferred
$5.5  billion of cash to Liberty  Media  Group,  used $5.1  billion  for capital
expenditures,  purchased portions of the IBM Global Network for $4.2 billion and
loaned $1.5 billion to MediaOne to pay termination  fees to Comcast.  During the
first half of 1998,  we received $5.7 billion as a settlement of a receivable in
conjunction  with the sale of UCS as well as $3.5  billion in proceeds  from the
sale.  We also  received a total of $1.6  billion in proceeds  from the sales of
LIN-TV,  ASCC and  SmarTone in the first half of 1998.  Our capital  spending of
$3.4 billion was the primary use of cash in the first six months of 1998.

During the first half of 1999, the net cash provided by financing activities was
$10,247  million  compared  with cash  used in  financing  activities  of $5,025
million in the first half of 1998.  During the first half of 1999, AT&T received
$7.9  billion of cash from a March 1999 bond  issuance,  $5.0  billion  from the
issuance  of  convertible  securities  and  warrants  to  Microsoft  Corporation
(Microsoft) and $3.3 billion from the issuance of commercial  paper.  From this,
$3.9  billion was used to fund the share  repurchase  program,  $2.0 billion was
used to retire  commercial  paper and other short-term debt and $1.3 billion was
used to pay dividends on common stock.  In the first half of 1998,  cash used in
financing  activities  was largely  attributable  to the pay down of  commercial
paper.

EBITDA  is a  measure  of our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow and  should  be
considered  in  addition  to, but not as a  substitute  for,  other  measures of
financial  performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. EBITDA increased $4,501 million, or 107.5%, for the six months ended
June 30, 1999, compared with the same period in 1998. Excluding AB&IS, AGNS, the
restructuring  and other  charges,  and gains on sales of businesses in 1999 and
1998,  EBITDA  increased 31.3% to $8,875 million in the first six months of 1999
from $6,761 million for the first six months of 1998. The increase was primarily
due to increased  revenues in business  services and cost reductions in consumer
services and corporate overhead.

EURO CONVERSION
On January 1, 1999,  certain  members of the European  Union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the European  Union's
currency (Euro).  The transition period is anticipated to extend between January
1, 1999,  and July 1, 2002.  We have  assessed the impact of the  conversion  on
information-technology  systems,  currency  exchange rate risk,  derivatives and
other financial instruments,  continuity of material contracts as well as income
tax and accounting issues. We do not expect the conversion during the transition
period to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Total assets increased  $85,688 million,  or 143.9%, to $145,238 million at June
30, 1999,  compared with December 31, 1998. The increase in total assets was due
primarily to our  acquisition of TCI, which resulted in an investment in Liberty
Media  Group  of $35  billion,  increased  goodwill,  and an  increase  in other
investments including Cablevision,  Excite@Home and Lenfest Communications, Inc.
The  acquisition  of TCI also  resulted  in the  addition  of over $6 billion to
property,  plant and  equipment.  Other  assets also  increased  by $1.5 million
representing  the Comcast  break-up fee loaned to MediaOne by AT&T. In addition,
we recognized  goodwill  related to our  acquisition of the IBM Global  Network.
These increases were partially  offset by a net decrease in cash, which was used
to partially  fund the first  quarter  share  repurchase,  capital  expenditures
during the period and the acquisition of the IBM Global Network.

Total  liabilities  increased  $29,070 million,  or 85.7%, to $62,989 million at
June 30, 1999,  compared with December 31, 1998.  The increase was due primarily
to the acquisition of TCI,  particularly debt and deferred income taxes, an $8.0
billion bond offering and the issuance of commercial paper.

In addition,  AT&T issued $5.0 billion of quarterly convertible income preferred
securities (recorded net of a $0.3 million discount) to Microsoft.

Total  shareowners'  equity  increased  $47,966 million,  or 187.9%,  to $73,488
million at June 30, 1999,  compared with December 31, 1998. The increase was due
primarily to the issuance of shares  related to the TCI  acquisition,  partially
offset by shares repurchased.

AT&T Group's  ratio of total debt to total  capital at June 30, 1999,  was 41.9%
compared  with  20.9% at  December  31,  1998.  Equity  includes  the $5 billion
convertible  securities  issued to Microsoft  and debt  includes $1.7 billion of
non-convertible  securities issued by TCI's subsidiary  trusts. The increase was
primarily driven by an increase in debt associated with the TCI merger and an $8
billion bond issuance in March 1999,  partially  offset by a higher equity base.
AT&T Group's net debt-to-operational EBITDA was 1.65X at June 30, 1999, compared
with 0.24X at December 31, 1998.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We are exposed to market  risk from  changes in  interest  and foreign  exchange
rates.  On a limited  basis we use  certain  derivative  financial  instruments,
including interest rate swaps, options,  forwards and other derivative contracts
to manage  these  risks.  We do not use  financial  instruments  for  trading or
speculative  purposes.  All financial  instruments  are used in accordance  with
board-approved policies.

Assuming a 10% downward  shift in interest rates at June 30, 1999, the potential
loss for changes in fair value of unhedged debt would have been $1.0 billion.

AT&T has a $20 billion  commitment from multiple lenders with credit  agreements
to be  finalized  upon  consummation  of the  proposed  merger with the MediaOne
Group.

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities.  " Among other
provisions, it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets
or  liabilities  in the  statement  of  financial  position  and  measure  those
instruments at fair value.  Gains and losses  resulting from changes in the fair
values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. This effective date of
this standard was delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective  date
for SFAS No. 133 is now for fiscal years beginning  after June 15, 2000,  though
earlier  adoption is encouraged and retroactive  application is prohibited.  For
AT&T this means that the standard must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001.
Management  does not expect the  adoption  of this  standard  to have a material
impact on AT&T's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

YEAR 2000
AT&T is  preparing  its systems and  applications  for the year 2000 (Y2K).  The
issue our Y2K program  addresses is the use of a two-digit year field instead of
a  four-digit  year  field in  computer  systems.  If  computer  systems  cannot
distinguish  between the year 1900 and the year 2000,  system  failures or other
computer  errors could  result.  The potential for failures and errors spans all
aspects of our business,  including  computer systems,  voice and data networks,
and  building   infrastructures.   We  are  also  faced  with   addressing   our
interdependencies  with our suppliers,  connecting carriers and major customers,
all of whom face the same issue.

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

AT&T's company-wide Y2K program is focused on four interrelated categories which
are   critical  to   maintaining   uninterrupted   service  to  our   customers:
AT&T-developed  applications  and  their  external  interfaces,  AT&T  networks,
information-technology (IT) platforms that support the applications,  and non-IT
infrastructure.

AT&T's  progress in our Y2K program is  measured  by certain key  milestones  or
phases common to each category of systems.  These  milestones  are:  assessment,
repair/remediation,  testing and  certification.  AT&T  monitors  and tracks the
progress  of our Y2K program  through a series of  scorecards  that  capture the
activities related to the Y2K process phases.

As of June 30, 1999,  AT&T's  network  services  (excluding  recently  completed
acquisitions)  are year 2000  compliant.  This means they have been assessed for
year 2000 impacts,  repaired if necessary,  tested and fully  deployed.  For all
other systems encompassed in our Y2K program, AT&T anticipates completion of all
phases by the third quarter of 1999,  which is an extension of our previous time
frame due  primarily  due to the impact of  acquisitions  and  vendor  delays in
delivering Y2K-compliant  software/hardware.  The status of TCI's Y2K program is
discussed  separately  from the existing AT&T program.  All targets cited herein
also exclude  information  regarding  pending  acquisitions,  whose programs are
still being  evaluated  and planned for  integration  into the overall  AT&T Y2K
program.

Program Status
AT&T now has over 3,500  applications that (1) directly support AT&T's voice and
data  telecommunications  services  (including  wired  and  wireless);  (2)  are
critical  to  the   provisioning,   administration,   maintenance  and  customer
service/support related to our telecommunications  services; and (3) support our
sales  and   marketing   organizations,   other  AT&T   services   and  internal
administrative functions. These applications represent over 380 million lines of
code. As of June 30, 1999,  AT&T has completed 100% of the assessment and repair
and about 98% of the application  testing.  The  certification and deployment of
these applications is targeted for completion in the third quarter of 1999.

With respect to external (third-party) interface assessment, formal letters were
sent to about 2,000  domestic  telecommunications  companies  and  international
telecommunications  authorities  to request  information  on their Y2K plans and
targets  for  compliance.  We have  identified  over  1,000  different  types of
third-party  interfaces and about 10,000 total  instances of those types.  As of
June 30, 1999,  AT&T has assessed  approximately  99% of  third-party  interface
types, and  approximately  98% are Y2K compliant.  We expect to be 100% complete
with Y2K certification of external interfaces in the third quarter of 1999.

The AT&T network is critical to providing top-quality,  reliable service to AT&T
customers. At June 30, 1999, the assessment,  repair and certification phases of
the operation-support  systems (OS) were 100% complete and these systems are now
fully deployed.  In addition to the AT&T-developed  applications  supporting the
network,  AT&T has  inventoried  about 2,000  unique  types  (manufactured/model
combinations)  externally  purchased  network elements (NE) including  switches,
routers,  network-control  points and  signal-transfer  points.  Additional  Y2K
testing is conducted to independently verify supplier claims of compliance.  All
of the NEs are now  certified.  After  OS/NE  certification  is  complete,  AT&T
performs  integration  testing to verify Y2K certification of NEs in conjunction
with the associated OS applications.  Such integration testing is 100% completed
as of June 30, 1999, and all of the NEs are fully deployed.

The IT infrastructure  category addresses not only the computing  platforms that
are critical to the  AT&T-developed  applications,  but also the common modules,
communications  protocols,  the internal AT&T wide-area and local-area networks,
desktop  hardware/software  and the internal voice network. As of June 30, 1999,
AT&T was approximately 96% compliant in computing platforms, about 94% compliant
in desktops,  approximately  98% compliant in voice  systems and  adjuncts,  and
about  99%  compliant  in  data  networks.  AT&T  anticipates  completion  of IT
infrastructure certification by the third quarter of 1999.

The non-IT  infrastructure  focuses on the  energy-  and  environment-management
systems  that are  critical  to  various  computer  systems,  as well as safety,
security and operations.  This aspect of the Y2K program  encompasses  more than
9,000 sites,  as well as about 7,000  wireless cell sites.  As of June 30, 1999,
approximately  98% of all sites  completed  inventory and about 94% are assessed
and compliant (or not impacted).  AT&T has targeted 100% site  compliance by the
third quarter of 1999.

In addition, AT&T is continuing network interoperability tests with a variety of
domestic  and  international  testing  partners.  These  tests are  designed  to
exercise the network  across a range of our vendors,  and across a range of AT&T
voice,  private line, and data  services.  We are also testing with key customer
and  industry   segments,   including   the  financial   community,   insurance,
transportation,  manufacturing  and others.  All test  results to date have been
positive.

Similar to AT&T's Y2K  program,  the TCI program has a  four-phased  approach to
determining the readiness of systems for Y2K, namely;  assessment,  remediation,
testing and implementation.  We anticipate  substantial completion of all phases
of TCI's  program  by the third  quarter  of 1999.  TCI is also  continuing  its
efforts to verify  the year 2000  readiness  of its  significant  suppliers  and
vendors and continued to  communicate  with  significant  business  partners and
affiliates to assess such partners and affiliates' year 2000 status.

CostsWe have expended  approximately $600 million since inception in 1997 on all
phases of the Y2K project.  This figure  includes  approximately  $98 million of
costs  incurred  during the second quarter of 1999, of which  approximately  $14
million represented  capital spending for upgrading and replacing  non-compliant
computer  systems  and  network  components.  Less than  half of the 1999  costs
represent  internal IT resources that have been  redeployed  from other projects
and are expected to return to these projects upon completion of the Y2K project.
We  anticipate  remaining  Y2K costs for 1999,  inclusive of  approximately  $69
million projected expenditures  associated with completing the TCI program, will
be  approximately  $156 million.  This  projection  includes  approximately  $50
million of capitalized costs.

Risk Assessment
We have  assessed our business  exposure that would result from a failure of our
Y2K program,  as well as those of our suppliers,  connecting  carriers and major
customers.  Such  failures  would  result in  business  consequences  that could
include failure to be able to serve  customers,  loss of network  functionality,
inability to render accurate bills, lost revenues, harm to the AT&T brand, legal
and regulatory exposure, and failure of management controls. Although we believe
that internal Y2K  compliance  will be achieved no later than December 31, 1999,
there can be no assurance that the Y2K problem will not have a material  adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Contingency Plans
AT&T's  contingency  planning program focuses on 38 critical business  processes
and many more that are designated as "important" or "support". The plans address
all    facets    of    business    continuity,    including    key    suppliers,
systems/applications,  IT infrastructure and work centers.  Specific examples of
AT&T's contingency plan initiatives include the following:

Plans are under way to engineer additional network capacity and to position AT&T
personnel  on site at  critical  locations  to  monitor  operations  and  manage
increases in work and call volumes.

Agreements  are being  negotiated  with  contractors  and  vendors to ensure the
availability of on-site technical support.  This coverage  includes,  but is not
limited to, network centers and sites, customer-care centers and data centers.

We  are  planning  to   proactively   stage   power,   fuel,   water,   heating,
air-conditioning and ventilation sources to support critical business operations
and personnel requirements.

Alternate  procedures  and  processes  are being  developed to support  critical
customer functions,  including alternative procedures for rapid repair, recovery
and restoration of critical technology components by business resumption teams.

Procedures to perform database backups,  hardcopy printouts,  data retention and
recovery are being established for business critical data.

Risk Management
In  addition  to the  contingency  planning  program,  AT&T has  implemented  an
Independent Verification and Validation program for applications to validate the
quality  of  application  remediation  and  testing,  as well as the  continuing
compliance  of systems  put back into  production.  We also  continue to conduct
independent audits across critical areas of the Y2K program.

OTHER MATTERS
On April 30, 1999,  AT&T  completed its  acquisition  of the IBM Global  Network
(IGN) business and its assets in the United States. The acquisition is occurring
in phases  throughout 1999 as legal and regulatory  requirements are met in each
of the 59  countries  in which  the  business  operates.  In June of  1999,  the
acquisitions  of the IGN business in Japan,  the United Kingdom and Ireland were
completed.  The acquisition  has been accounted for as a purchase.  Accordingly,
the operating results of the IGN business have been included in the accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  since the date of  acquisition.  Intangible
assets of approximately  $3.9 billion including customer lists and the excess of
the  purchase  price  over  the fair  value of net  assets  acquired  are  being
amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods ranging from five-30 years. The
pro forma impact of the IGN business  results on historical AT&T results are not
material.

On May 3, 1999,  AT&T  closed the  previously  announced  merger  with  Vanguard
Cellular Systems,  Inc.  (Vanguard).  Consummation of the merger resulted in the
issuance of  approximately  12.6 million AT&T shares and payment of $485 million
in cash. In addition, Vanguard had approximately $550 million in debt, which was
subsequently  repaid  by AT&T.  The  merger  with  Vanguard  was  recorded  as a
purchase.  Accordingly  the operating  results of Vanguard have been included in
the   accompanying   consolidated   financial   statements  since  the  date  of
acquisition. The pro forma impact of Vanguard results on historical AT&T results
are not material.

On June 1, 1999,  AT&T Canada  completed  the  announced  merger  with  MetroNet
Communications Corp. (MetroNet),  Canada's largest facilities-based  competitive
local exchange carrier (CLEC).  The combined companies were renamed AT&T Canada.
AT&T owns a 31% stake in the merged entity, which maintains a national network
to provide Canadian business customers with local and long distance voice, data,
Internet and electronic  commerce  services as well as wireless services through
Rogers Cantel AT&T.

On June 7, 1999,  AT&T signed a definitive  agreement  with Cox  Communications,
Inc. (Cox) whereby Cox will exchange its AT&T stock for cable television systems
that  serve   approximately   495,000   customers  as  well  as  certain   other
consideration, including cash. Based on the closing price of AT&T stock when the
agreement  was  announced,  the  transaction  is  valued at  approximately  $2.8
billion.  The agreement  has been  approved by the boards of both  companies and
will be subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals.

On June 29, 1999,  the  previously  announced  global  venture  between AT&T and
British  Telecommunications  plc (BT) received  approval  from the U.S.  Justice
Department.  The  venture  has  already  received  approval  from  the  European
Commission.   The  global  venture  will  combine  the  transborder  assets  and
operations of each company.  The venture will be equally owned by both companies
when  it  begins  operations.  The  receipt  of  certain  additional  regulatory
approvals  is required and the venture is expected to be completed in the second
half of 1999.

On May 28, 1999, At Home Corporation consummated a merger agreement with Excite,
Inc.  (Excite),  a global  Internet  media  company  that offers  consumers  and
advertisers   comprehensive   Internet   navigation   services  with   extensive
personalization  capabilities.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, At Home
Corporation  issued  approximately  116 million  shares of its common  stock (as
adjusted for a June 1999 stock split) for all of the outstanding common stock of
Excite based on an exchange  ratio of 2.083804  shares of At Home  Corporation's
common  stock  (as  adjusted  for a June 1999  stock  split)  for each  share of
Excite's common stock. As a result of the merger, AT&T's economic interest in At
Home  Corporation  (Excite@Home)  decreased  from  38.8%  to  26.5%.  Due to the
resulting  increase  in  Excite@Home's  equity,  net of the  dilution  of AT&T's
ownership  interest in  Exite@Home,  AT&T  recorded a $466  million  increase to
additional paid in capital.  At June 30, 1999, AT&T owned  63,720,000  shares of
Excite@Home  Class A common  stock (as adjusted for a June 1999 stock split) and
has an approximate  58% voting  interest on certain  matters.  During the second
quarter of 1999, the stockholders of Excite@Home approved certain changes in the
corporate  governance of Excite@Home.  As a result of these changes,  management
has  concluded  that AT&T no longer holds a  controlling  financial  interest in
Excite@Home and, accordingly,  during the second quarter of 1999, AT&T ceased to
consolidate  Excite@Home and began to account for  Excite@Home  using the equity
method of accounting.  The effect of this  deconsolidation was immaterial to the
consolidated financial statements of AT&T.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On August 2, 1999, AT&T completed its acquisition of Honolulu Cellular Telephone
Company from BellSouth.

On August 5, 1999,  AT&T and BT announced  that they will jointly  acquire a 33%
stake  in  Rogers  Cantel  Mobile   Communications   Inc.  (Rogers  Cantel)  for
approximately $934 million in cash. The investment will be owned equally by AT&T
and BT.  AT&T and BT also  announced  that BT will  acquired  30% of AT&T's  31%
ownership interest in AT&T Canada for approximately  $402 million.  In addition,
Rogers Cantel and AT&T Canada will  accelerate the bundling and joint  marketing
of wired and wireless services for Canadian business  customers.  The closing of
these transactions is expected to take place in late August 1999.

Item 2(c).  Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On June 16, 1999, in a private  placement  transaction  exempt from registration
pursuant  to  Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  as a
transaction  not  involving a public  offering,  the company  sold to  Microsoft
Corporation for an aggregate  price of $5 billion newly issued AT&T  convertible
trust  preferred  securities  with an  aggregate  face  amount of $5 billion and
warrants to purchase 40 million shares of AT&T common stock.

The  convertible  trust  preferred  securities bear interest at a rate of 5% per
annum,  payable  quarterly,  are  convertible  into 66.7 million  shares of AT&T
common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $75 per share, have a
maturity  of 30 years,  and the  conversion  feature  can be  terminated,  under
certain conditions, after three years. The warrants will be exercisable in three
years to purchase 40 million AT&T common shares at $75 per share. Alternatively,
the warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis.

There were no underwriting discounts or commissions.  The company intends to use
the proceeds to fund working capital and capital expenditures.

                     Notes to Combined Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 1999
                                   (unaudited)

(1)      Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying  combined financial statements include the accounts of
         the subsidiaries and assets of  Tele-Communications,  Inc. ("TCI") that
         are attributed to Liberty Media Group,  as defined  below.  On March 9,
         1999,  AT&T acquired TCI in a merger  transaction  (the "AT&T Merger").
         See note 2. The AT&T Merger has been  accounted  for using the purchase
         method.  For financial  reporting  purposes the AT&T Merger and related
         restructuring  transactions  described  in  note 2 are  deemed  to have
         occurred on March 1, 1999.  Accordingly,  for periods prior to March 1,
         1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and
         the related  combined  financial  statements are sometimes  referred to
         herein as "Old  Liberty",  and for periods  subsequent  to February 28,
         1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and
         the related  combined  financial  statements are sometimes  referred to
         herein as "New Liberty".  The "Company" and "Liberty Media Group" refer
         to both New Liberty and Old Liberty.

         The following table represents the summary balance sheet of Old Liberty
         at February 28, 1999 prior to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of the AT&T Merger and the opening  summary balance sheet
         of New Liberty  subsequent to the  restructuring  transactions  and the
         consummation  of  the  AT&T  Merger.  Certain  pre-merger  transactions
         occurring  between  March 1, 1999 and March 9, 1999 that  affected  Old
         Liberty's equity, gains on issuance of equity by subsidiaries and stock
         compensation have been reflected in the two-month period ended February
         28, 1999.

         At June 30, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  consisted  principally  of the
         following:  (i) AT&T's assets and businesses which provide  programming
         services including production, acquisition and distribution through all
         available formats and media of branded  entertainment,  educational and
         informational programming and software,  including multimedia products,
         (ii) AT&T's  assets and  businesses  engaged in  electronic  retailing,
         direct marketing,  advertising sales relating to programming  services,
         infomercials and transaction processing, (iii) certain of AT&T's assets
         and  businesses   engaged  in   international   cable,   telephony  and
         programming  businesses  and (iv)  AT&T's  holdings  in a new  class of
         tracking stock of Sprint (the "Sprint PCS Group Stock").

         All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
         eliminated.  The combined  financial  statements of Liberty Media Group
         are presented for purposes of additional  analysis of the  consolidated
         financial  statements  of AT&T and should be read in  conjunction  with
         such consolidated financial statements.

         The accompanying  interim combined  financial  statements are unaudited
         but, in the opinion of management,  reflect all adjustments (consisting
         of normal recurring  accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the
         results for such  periods.  The results of  operations  for any interim
         period are not  necessarily  indicative  of results  for the full year.
         These combined financial  statements should be read in conjunction with
         the combined financial statements and notes thereto contained in AT&T's
         Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 22, 1999.

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements  and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         Effective June 11, 1999, AT&T issued stock dividends to holders of AT&T
         Liberty Media Group Tracking Stock (the "1999 Liberty Stock Dividend").
         The 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend  consisted of one share of AT&T Liberty
         Media Group  Tracking  Stock for every one share of AT&T Liberty  Media
         Group  Tracking  Stock owned.  The 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend has been
         treated  as a stock  split,  and  accordingly,  all share and per share
         amounts have been restated to reflect the 1999 Liberty Stock Dividend.

         Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified for  comparability
         with the 1999 presentation.

(2)      Merger with AT&T

         As a  result  of the AT&T  Merger,  holders  of  shares  of TCI's  then
         outstanding  Liberty Media Group  Tracking Stock and TCI Ventures Group
         Tracking  Stock were issued  separate  shares of new targeted  stock of
         AT&T. Each share of TCI's then outstanding Liberty Media Group Series A
         Tracking  Stock was converted into 2 shares of a newly created class of
         AT&T common stock, the AT&T Liberty Media Group Class A Tracking Stock,
         each share of TCI's  then  outstanding  Liberty  Media  Group  Series B
         Tracking  Stock was converted into 2 shares of a newly created class of
         AT&T common stock, the AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock,
         each  share of TCI's  then  outstanding  TCI  Ventures  Group  Series A
         Tracking  Stock was  converted  into 1.04 shares of AT&T Liberty  Media
         Group Class A Tracking  Stock and each share of TCI's then  outstanding
         TCI Ventures  Group  Series B Tracking  Stock was  converted  into 1.04
         shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock.

         Effective  with  the AT&T  Merger,  each  share  of  TCI's  Convertible
         Preferred  Stock Series  C-Liberty Media Group was converted into 112.5
         shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media  Group  Class A Tracking  Stock and each
         share of TCI's  Redeemable  Convertible  Liberty Media Group  Preferred
         Stock, Series H was converted into 1.18125 shares of AT&T Liberty Media
         Group Class A Tracking Stock. In general, the holders of shares of AT&T
         Liberty Media Group Class A Tracking Stock and the holders of shares of
         AT&T Liberty Media Group Class B Tracking Stock will vote together as a
         single  class with the  holders of shares of AT&T  Common  Stock on all
         matters presented to such stockholders, with the holders being entitled
         to  three-fortieths  (3/40th) of a vote for each share of AT&T  Liberty
         Media Group Class A Tracking Stock held, three-fourths (3/4th) vote per
         share of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  Class B Tracking  Stock held and 1
         vote per share of AT&T Common Stock held.

         The shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  Tracking  Stock issued in the
         AT&T Merger are  intended to reflect the  separate  performance  of the
         businesses  and assets  attributed to Liberty Media Group.  Immediately
         prior to the AT&T Merger,  certain assets previously  attributed to Old
         Liberty  (including,  among  others,  the shares of AT&T  Common  Stock
         received in the merger of AT&T and Teleport  Communications Group, Inc.
         ("Teleport")  (see  note  7),  Old  Liberty's   interests  in  At  Home
         Corporation  ("@Home"),  the National Digital Television  Center,  Inc.
         ("NDTC") and Western Tele-Communications, Inc.) were attributed to "TCI
         Group" (a group of TCI's assets,  which,  prior to the AT&T Merger, was
         comprised   primarily  of  TCI's  domestic  cable  and   communications
         business)  in  exchange  for  approximately  $5.5  billion in cash (the
         "Asset Transfers"). Also, upon consummation of the AT&T Merger, through
         a new tax sharing  agreement  between the Company and AT&T, the Company
         is entitled to the benefit of approximately $2 billion in net operating
         loss  carryforwards   available  to  the  entities  included  in  TCI's
         consolidated  income tax return as of the date of the AT&T Merger. Such
         net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are subject to  adjustment  by the
         Internal  Revenue  Service  ("IRS") and are subject to  limitations  on
         usage  which may affect the  ultimate  amount  utilized.  Additionally,
         certain warrants to purchase shares of General Instruments  Corporation
         ("GI Warrants")  previously  attributed to TCI Group were attributed to
         the Company in exchange for approximately $176 million in cash. Certain
         agreements  entered into at the time of the AT&T Merger provide,  among
         other things,  for  preferred  vendor status to the Company for digital
         basic  distribution  on  AT&T's  systems  of new  programming  services
         created  by the  Company  and for a  renewal  of  existing  affiliation
         agreements.  Pursuant to amended corporate governance documents for the
         entities  included in Liberty Media Group and certain  agreements among
         AT&T and TCI, the business of Liberty  Media Group will  continue to be
         managed by certain persons who were members of TCI's  management  prior
         to the AT&T Merger.

         Pursuant to a proposed final judgment (the "Final  Judgment") agreed to
         by TCI, AT&T and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") on
         December  31,  1998,   Liberty  Media  Group  transferred  all  of  its
         beneficially owned securities (the "Sprint  Securities") of Sprint to a
         trustee (the "Trustee")  prior to the AT&T Merger.  The Final Judgment,
         if entered by the United  States  District  Court for the  District  of
         Columbia,  would  require the Trustee,  on or before May 23,  2002,  to
         dispose  of a portion  of the  Sprint  Securities  sufficient  to cause
         Liberty  Media  Group  to  beneficially  own no  more  than  10% of the
         outstanding  Series 1 PCS Stock of Sprint on a fully  diluted  basis on
         such date.  On or before May 23,  2004,  the  Trustee  must  divest the
         remainder of the Sprint Securities  beneficially owned by Liberty Media
         Group.

         The Final  Judgment  would  provide  that the  Trustee  vote the Sprint
         Securities  beneficially  owned  by  Liberty  Media  Group  in the same
         proportion  as other  holders  of  Sprint's  PCS  Stock so long as such
         securities  are  held by the  trust.  The  Final  Judgment  would  also
         prohibit the  acquisition  by Liberty Media Group of additional  Sprint
         Securities, with certain exceptions,  without the prior written consent
         of the DOJ.

(3)      Loss Per Common Share

         Basic  earnings or loss per share  ("EPS") is measured as the income or
         loss  attributable  to  common  stockholders  divided  by the  weighted
         average  outstanding  common  shares  for the  period.  Diluted  EPS is
         similar to basic EPS but presents  the  dilutive  effect on a per share
         basis of potential  common shares as if they had been  converted at the
         beginning of the periods  presented.  Potential common shares that have
         an anti-dilutive effect are excluded from diluted EPS.

         The basic and diluted loss  attributable  to Liberty Media Group common
         stockholders  per common share for the three and four months ended June
         30, 1999 was computed by dividing the net loss  attributable to Liberty
         Media Group  common  stockholders  by the  weighted  average  number of
         common shares  outstanding  of AT&T Liberty Media Group  Tracking Stock
         during each period.  Potential  common  shares were not included in the
         computations  of weighted  average  shares  outstanding  because  their
         inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

         At June  30,  1999,  there  were 54  million  potential  common  shares
         consisting of fixed and nonvested performance awards, stock options and
         convertible   securities  that  could  potentially  dilute  future  EPS
         calculations  in periods of net  earnings.  No material  changes in the
         weighted average outstanding shares or potential common shares occurred
         after June 30, 1999.

         USAI owns and operates businesses in network and television production,
         television  broadcasting,  electronic retailing,  ticketing operations,
         and internet  services.  At June 30, 1999, Liberty Media Group directly
         and indirectly held 29.6 million shares of USAI's common stock. Liberty
         Media Group also held shares  directly in certain  subsidiaries of USAI
         which are  exchangeable  into 39.5 million shares of USAI common stock.
         Liberty Media Group's direct ownership of USAI is currently  restricted
         by FCC  regulations.  The exchange of these shares can be  accomplished
         only if there is a change to existing  regulations  or if Liberty Media
         Group obtains permission from the FCC. If the exchange of Liberty Media
         Group's shares of such subsidiary stock, as well as certain  securities
         owned by Universal  Studios,  Inc. and certain of its affiliates,  into
         USAI common stock were completed at June 30, 1999,  Liberty Media Group
         would own 69.1 million shares or approximately  21% (on a fully-diluted
         basis) of USAI common stock.  USAI's common stock had a closing  market
         price of  $40-1/8  per  share on June 30,  1999.  Liberty  Media  Group
         accounts  for its  investments  in USAI and related  subsidiaries  on a
         combined basis under the equity method.

         In  February  1998,  USAI paid  cash and  issued  shares  and one of it
         subsidiaries  issued  shares  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of
         certain   assets  from   Universal   Studios,   Inc.  (the   "Universal
         Transaction").   Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  an  increase  to  its
         investment in USAI of $54 million and an increase to combined equity of
         $33 million (after deducting a deferred income taxes of $21 million) as
         a result of this share issuance. No gain was recognized in the combined
         statement of operations  and  comprehensive  earnings for the Universal
         Transaction  due primarily to Liberty  Media Group's  intention at such
         time to purchase  additional  equity  interests in USAI.  In connection
         with the  Universal  Transaction,  Liberty  Media  Group was granted an
         antidilutive  right with respect to any future  issuance of USAI common
         stock, subject to certain limitations,  that enables it to maintain its
         percentage ownership interests in USAI.

         Telewest   currently  operates  and  constructs  cable  television  and
         telephone  systems  in the UK. At June 30,  1999  Liberty  Media  Group
         indirectly  owned 463  million of the issued and  outstanding  Telewest
         ordinary  shares.  The  reported  closing  price  on the  London  Stock
         Exchange of Telewest ordinary shares was (pound)2.85  ($4.49) per share
         at June 30, 1999.

         Liberty Media Group and The News  Corporation  Limited  ("News  Corp.")
         each held 50% of Fox Sports which operates national and regional sports
         networks.  Prior to the first quarter of 1998,  Liberty Media Group had
         no obligation,  nor intention, to fund Fox Sports. During 1998, Liberty
         Media  Group made the  determination  to provide  funding to Fox Sports
         based on specific transactions consummated by Fox Sports. Consequently,
         Liberty  Media Group's share of losses of Fox Sports for the six months
         ended June 30,  1998  included  previously  unrecognized  losses of Fox
         Sports of  approximately  $64  million.  Losses for Fox Sports were not
         recognized  in prior periods due to the fact that Liberty Media Group's
         investment in Fox Sports was less than zero.

         On July 15, 1999 News Corp. acquired Liberty Media Group's 50% interest
         in Fox  Sports  in  exchange  for  51.8  million  News  Corp.  American
         Depository  Receipts  ("ADRs")  representing  preferred  limited voting
         ordinary shares of News Corp. In a related  transaction,  Liberty Media
         Group   acquired  from  News  Corp.   28.1  million   additional   ADRs
         representing preferred limited voting ordinary shares of News Corp. for
         approximately $695 million.

         The class A common  stock of TV Guide is publicly  traded.  At June 30,
         1999,  Liberty  Media Group held 29 million  shares of TV Guide Class A
         common  stock and 37 million  shares of TV Guide Class B common  stock.
         See  note  7.  The TV  Guide  Class  B  common  stock  is  convertible,
         one-for-one,  into TV Guide Class A common stock. The closing price for
         TV Guide Class A common stock was $36-5/8 per share on June 30, 1999.

         Flextech develops and sells a variety of television  programming in the
         UK. At June 30, 1999,  Liberty Media Group  indirectly owned 58 million
         Flextech  ordinary  shares.  The reported  closing  price on the London
         Stock  Exchange  of  the  Flextech  ordinary  shares  was  (pound)10.22
         ($16.11) per share at June 30, 1999.

         The PCS Ventures  included Sprint Spectrum Holding  Company,  L. P. and
         MinorCo, L.P. (collectively, "Sprint PCS") and PhillieCo Partnership I,
         L.P. ("PhillieCo"). The partners of each of the Sprint PCS partnerships
         were  subsidiaries  of Sprint,  Comcast  Corporation  ("Comcast"),  Cox
         Communications,  Inc.  ("Cox") and Liberty Media Group. The partners of
         PhillieCo  were  subsidiaries  of Sprint,  Cox and Liberty Media Group.
         Liberty  Media  Group  had a 30%  partnership  interest  in each of the
         Sprint PCS partnerships and a 35% partnership interest in PhillieCo.

         On November 23, 1998, Liberty Media Group,  Comcast,  and Cox exchanged
         their  respective  interests  in  Sprint  PCS and  PhillieCo  (the "PCS
         Exchange")  for  shares of Sprint  PCS Group  Stock  which  tracks  the
         performance of Sprint's newly created PCS Group  (consisting  initially
         of the PCS  Ventures  and certain PCS  licenses  which were  separately
         owned by Sprint). The Sprint PCS Group Stock collectively represents an
         approximate  17%  voting  interest  in  Sprint.  As a result of the PCS
         Exchange,  Liberty  Media  Group  holds  the  Sprint  Securities  which
         consists  of shares  of Sprint  PCS  Group  Stock,  as well as  certain
         additional  securities of Sprint  exercisable  for or convertible  into
         such securities,  representing approximately 24% of the equity value of
         Sprint  attributable  to its PCS Group  and less than 1% of the  voting
         interest in Sprint.  Through  November  23, 1998,  Liberty  Media Group
         accounted for its interest in the PCS Ventures  using the equity method
         of  accounting,  however,  as a result of the PCS  Exchange and Liberty
         Media  Group's less than 1% voting  interest in Sprint,  Liberty  Media
         Group no longer  exercises  significant  influence  with respect to its
         investment  in the  PCS  Ventures.  Accordingly,  Liberty  Media  Group
         accounts  for its  investment  in the  Sprint  PCS  Group  Stock  as an
         available-for-sale security.

         The $14 billion  aggregate  excess of Liberty Media  Group's  aggregate
         carrying   amount  in  its   affiliates   over  Liberty  Media  Group's
         proportionate  share of its  affiliates'  net assets is being amortized
         over an estimated useful life of 20 years.

         Certain of Liberty Media Group's  affiliates  are general  partnerships
         and  subsidiaries  of Liberty Media Group that are general  partners in
         such  partnerships,  are liable as a matter of partnership  law for all
         debts (other than non-recourse  debts) of that partnership in the event
         liabilities of that partnership were to exceed its assets.

(6)      Investment in Time Warner

         Liberty  Media Group holds shares of a series of Time  Warner's  series
         common stock with limited voting rights (the "TW Exchange  Stock") that
         are convertible  into an aggregate of 114 million shares of Time Warner
         common stock.

         As security for borrowings under one of its credit facilities,  Liberty
         Media Group has pledged a portion of its TW Exchange Stock. At June 30,
         1999 such pledged portion had an aggregate fair value of  approximately
         $3.2 billion.

         On June 24, 1997  Liberty  Media Group  granted  Time Warner an option,
         expiring  October  10,  2002,  to  acquire  the  business  of  Southern
         Satellite  Systems,  Inc.  ("Southern") and certain of its subsidiaries
         (together with Southern, the "Southern Business") through a purchase of
         assets (the "Southern Option").  Liberty Media Group received shares of
         TW Exchange  Stock which are  convertible  into 12.8 million  shares of
         Time Warner  common stock valued at $306 million in  consideration  for
         the grant.  In  September  1997,  Time Warner  exercised  the  Southern
         Option.  Pursuant to the  Southern  Option,  Time Warner  acquired  the
         Southern Business, effective January 1, 1998, for $213 million in cash.
         Liberty  Media  Group   recognized  a  $515  million  pre-tax  gain  in
         connection with such transactions in the first quarter of 1998.

(7)      Acquisitions and Dispositions

         On January  12,  1998,  Liberty  Media Group  acquired  from a minority
         shareholder  of TV Guide  (formerly  known as  United  Video  Satellite
         Group, Inc.  ("UVSG")) 24.8 million shares of UVSG Class A common stock
         in  exchange  for 12.7  million  shares of TCI's then  outstanding  TCI
         Ventures  Group Series A Tracking Stock and 7.3 million shares of TCI's
         then  outstanding  Liberty  Media Group  Series A Tracking  Stock.  The
         aggregate  value  assigned  to such  shares  issued  was based upon the
         market value of such shares at the time the  transaction was announced.
         As a result of such  transaction  Liberty  Media  Group  increased  its
         ownership  in the  equity of UVSG to  approximately  73% and the voting
         power increased to 93%. In connection with the issuance of common stock
         in such  transaction,  Liberty  Media  Group  recorded  a $346  million
         increase to combined equity.

         Effective  February  1, 1998,  Turner-Vision,  Inc.  ("Turner  Vision")
         contributed the assets, obligations and operations of its retail C-band
         satellite business to  Superstar/Netlink  Group LLC ("SNG") in exchange
         for  an  approximate   20%  interest  in  SNG.  As  a  result  of  such
         transaction,  Liberty Media Group's direct and indirect  (through UVSG)
         ownership   interest  in  SNG,   decreased  to  approximately  80%.  In
         connection  with the increase in SNG's  equity,  net of the dilution of
         Liberty  Media  Group's  ownership  interest in SNG, that resulted from
         such transaction,  Liberty Media Group recognized a gain of $38 million
         (before deducting  deferred income tax expense of $15 million).  Turner
         Vision's  contribution  to SNG was  accounted for as a purchase and the
         $61 million excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
         assets acquired was recorded as excess cost and is being amortized over
         five years.

         On April 22, 1998,  Teleport  completed a merger  transaction  with ACC
         Corp.  As a result,  Liberty  Media  Group's  interest in Teleport  was
         reduced to  approximately  26%.  In  connection  with the  increase  in
         Teleport's  equity,  net of  the  dilution  of  Liberty  Media  Group's
         interest in Teleport,  that  resulted  from the merger,  Liberty  Media
         Group  recorded  a  non-cash  gain of $201  million  (before  deducting
         deferred income tax expense of $71 million).

         On July 24, 1998, Teleport was acquired by AT&T and Liberty Media Group
         received in exchange for all of its interest in Teleport, approximately
         70.4  million  shares of AT&T common  stock (as  adjusted for a 3-for-2
         stock split).

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         On March 1, 1999, UVSG and News Corp.  completed a transaction  whereby
         UVSG  acquired  News  Corp.'s  TV Guide  properties  creating a broader
         platform  for  offering  television  guide  services to  consumers  and
         advertisers  and  UVSG  was  renamed  TV  Guide.  A unit of News  Corp.
         received  $800 million in cash and 60 million  shares of UVSG's  stock,
         including  22.5  million  shares of its  Class A common  stock and 37.5
         million  shares of its Class B common  stock.  In addition,  News Corp.
         purchased  approximately 6.5 million  additional shares of UVSG Class A
         common stock for $129 million in order to equalize its  ownership  with
         that of Liberty  Media Group.  As a result of these  transactions,  and
         another  transaction  completed on the same date,  News Corp.,  Liberty
         Media Group and TV Guide's public stockholders own on an economic basis
         approximately 44%, 44% and 12%,  respectively,  of TV Guide.  Following
         such  transactions,  News  Corp.  and  Liberty  Media  Group  each have
         approximately 49% of the voting power of TV Guide's  outstanding stock.
         In  connection  with the  increase  in TV  Guide's  equity,  net of the
         dilution  of Liberty  Media  Group's  ownership  interest  in TV Guide,
         Liberty Media Group recognized a gain of $372 million (before deducting
         deferred  income  tax  expense  of $147  million).  Upon  consummation,
         Liberty Media Group began accounting for its interest in TV Guide under
         the equity method of accounting.

(8)      Long-Term Debt

         Debt is summarized as follows:

</TABLE>
         On April 8, 1999,  Liberty Media Group redeemed all of its  outstanding
         4-1/2% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due February 15, 2005. See
         note 10.

         At June 30, 1999, Liberty Media Group had approximately $876 million in
         unused lines of credit under its bank credit facilities.

         The bank credit  facilities  of Liberty Media Group  generally  contain
         restrictive   covenants   which  require,   among  other  things,   the
         maintenance of certain  financial  ratios,  and include  limitations on
         indebtedness,  liens  and  encumbrances,   acquisitions,  dispositions,
         guarantees and dividends.  Additionally,  Liberty Media Group pays fees
         ranging from .15% to .375% per annum on the average unborrowed portions
         of the total  amounts  available for  borrowings  under its bank credit
         facilities.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         As collateral for borrowings  under one of Liberty Media Group's credit
         facilities, the banks lend against certain assets designated by Liberty
         Media  Group (the  "Designated  Assets").  The  carrying  amount of the
         Designated Assets as of June 30, 1999 was $6.5 billion. Recourse to the
         banks for  payment  of Liberty  Media  Group's  obligations  under this
         facility is limited solely to the Designated Assets.  Also, as security
         for borrowings under one of its credit facilities,  Liberty Media Group
         has pledged a portion of its TW Exchange Stock. See note 6.

         Certain of Liberty  Media  Group's bank credit  facilities  have credit
         agreements  which provide for a three month interest reserve to be held
         by an  administrative  agent.  Such interest  reserves  amounted to $18
         million  and $17  million as of June 30, 1999 and  December  31,  1998,
         respectively,   and  are  included  in  other  current  assets  in  the
         accompanying combined balance sheets.

         Liberty Media Group  believes that the carrying  value of Liberty Media
         Group's debt approximated its fair value at June 30, 1999.

         On July 7, 1999,  Liberty  Media Group  received  net cash  proceeds of
         approximately $741 million and $494 million from the issuance of 7-7/8%
         Senior Notes due 2009 (the "Senior Notes") and 8-1/2% Senior Debentures
         due 2029 (the "Senior Debentures"), respectively. The Senior Notes have
         an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and the Senior Debentures
         have an aggregate  principal  amount of $500  million.  Interest on the
         Senior  Notes and the  Senior  Debentures  is payable on January 15 and
         July 15 of each  year.  The  proceeds  were  used to repay  outstanding
         borrowings  under certain of Liberty Media Group's  credit  facilities,
         which were subsequently canceled.

(9)      Income Taxes

         Subsequent  to the AT&T Merger,  Liberty Media Group is included in the
         consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  of AT&T and  party to a tax
         sharing  agreement  with AT&T (the "AT&T Tax Sharing  Agreement").  The
         income tax provision for Liberty Media Group is calculated based on the
         increase  or  decrease in the tax  liability  of the AT&T  consolidated
         group  resulting from the inclusion of those items in the  consolidated
         tax return of AT&T which are attributable to Liberty Media Group.

         Under the AT&T Tax Sharing Agreement,  Liberty Media Group will receive
         a cash payment from AT&T in periods  when it generates  taxable  losses
         and such taxable losses are utilized by AT&T to reduce the consolidated
         income  tax  liability.  This  utilization  of taxable  losses  will be
         accounted for by Liberty Media Group as a current federal  intercompany
         income tax benefit. To the extent such losses are not utilized by AT&T,
         such  amounts  will be  available  to  reduce  federal  taxable  income
         generated by Liberty  Media Group in future  periods,  similar to a net
         operating  loss  carryforward  and will be accounted  for as a deferred
         federal income tax benefit.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         In periods when Liberty Media Group  generates  federal taxable income,
         AT&T has agreed to satisfy such tax  liability on Liberty Media Group's
         behalf up to a certain  amount.  The  reduction  of such  computed  tax
         liabilities will be accounted for by Liberty Media Group as a credit to
         combined equity.  The total amount of future federal tax liabilities of
         Liberty  Media Group which AT&T will satisfy under the AT&T Tax Sharing
         Agreement is  approximately  $512  million,  which  represents  the tax
         effect of the net operating loss carryforward  reflected in TCI's final
         federal  income tax  return,  subject to IRS  adjustments.  Thereafter,
         Liberty  Media  Group is  required  to make cash  payments  to AT&T for
         federal tax liabilities of Liberty Media Group.

         To the extent AT&T utilizes  existing net operating  losses of entities
         attributed to Liberty  Media Group,  such amounts will be accounted for
         by Liberty Media Group as a reduction of combined equity.

         Liberty Media Group will  generally  make cash payments to AT&T related
         to states where it generates  taxable  income and receive cash payments
         from AT&T in states where it generates taxable losses.

         Liberty  Media  Group's  obligation  under  the  1995  TCI Tax  Sharing
         Agreement of approximately $139 million (subject to adjustment),  which
         is included in "due to related  parties," shall be paid at the time, if
         ever, that Liberty Media Group  deconsolidates from the AT&T income tax
         return. Liberty Media Group's receivable under the 1997 TCI Tax Sharing
         Agreement  of  approximately  $220 million was forgiven in the AT&T Tax
         Sharing  Agreement and recorded as an adjustment to combined  equity by
         Liberty Media Group in connection with the AT&T Merger.

(10)     Combined Equity

         Stock Repurchase and Issuances

         On April 8, 1999,  Liberty Media Group redeemed all of its  outstanding
         4-1/2% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due February 15, 2005. The
         debentures  were  convertible  into shares of AT&T Liberty  Media Group
         Class A Tracking Stock at a conversion price of $23.54, or 42.48 shares
         per $1,000  principal  amount.  Certain  holders of the  debentures had
         exercised  their rights to convert  their  debentures  and 14.6 million
         shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group  Tracking  Stock were issued to such
         holders.  In connection  with such issuance of AT&T Liberty Media Group
         Tracking Stock, Liberty Media Group recorded a $354 million increase to
         combined equity.

         During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  1998,  pursuant  to a stock
         repurchase  program,  Liberty Media Group repurchased 239,450 shares of
         TCI's then  outstanding  TCI Ventures Group Stock and 266,783 shares of
         TCI's then  outstanding  Liberty Media Group Stock at an aggregate cost
         of $12 million.

         In conjunction with a stock repurchase program or similar  transaction,
         the  issuer  may elect to sell put  options  on its own  common  stock.
         Proceeds from any sales of puts with respect to TCI's then  outstanding
         TCI Ventures Group Tracking  Stock and TCI's then  outstanding  Liberty
         Media  Group  Tracking  Stock have been  reflected  as an  increase  to
         combined equity,  and an amount equal to the maximum  redemption amount
         under  unexpired put options with respect to such  tracking  stocks was
         reflected as an "obligation to redeem common stock" in the accompanying
         combined balance sheets.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         Stock Issuances by Subsidiary

         During the second quarter of 1999, TCI Music issued  approximately  4.8
         million shares of common stock in connection with the conversion of its
         preferred stock and approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock in
         connection  with the exercise of certain  employee stock options.  As a
         result, Liberty Media Group's interest in TCI Music was reduced to 86%.
         In  connection  with the  increase  in TCI Music's  equity,  net of the
         dilution of Liberty Media Group's interest in TCI Music,  that resulted
         from such stock  issuances,  Liberty Media Group recorded a $40 million
         increase to combined equity.

         Transactions with AT&T (formerly TCI) and Other Related Parties

         Certain AT&T corporate general and administrative  costs are charged to
         Liberty Media Group. Included in operating expenses in the accompanying
         combined  statements of operations and comprehensive  earnings,  during
         the four month period  ended June 30, 1999,  the two month period ended
         February 28, 1999 and the six months ended June 30, 1998, Liberty Media
         Group was  allocated  less than $1 million,  $2 million and $9 million,
         respectively, in corporate general and administrative costs by TCI.

         Certain  subsidiaries  attributed to Liberty Media Group produce and/or
         distribute  sports and other  programming  and other  services to cable
         distribution operators (including AT&T) and others. Charges to AT&T are
         based upon  customary  rates  charged to others.  Amounts  included  in
         revenue for services provided to AT&T were $71 million, $43 million and
         $130  million for the four month period  ending June 30, 1999,  the two
         month period ending February 28, 1999 and the six months ended June 30,
         1998, respectively.

         Entities  included in Liberty Media Group lease  satellite  transponder
         facilities  from NDTC. In connection  with the AT&T Merger,  NDTC is no
         longer  included in the  combined  financial  results of Liberty  Media
         Group.  Charges  by  NDTC  for  such  arrangements  and  other  related
         operating  expenses for the four months ended June 30, 1999  aggregated
         $10 million and are included in operating  expenses in the accompanying
         combined statements of operations and comprehensive earnings.

         A  subsidiary  of  Liberty  Media  Group  issued   preferred  stock  in
         connection  with a previous  acquisition  which was  convertible at the
         option of the holders  into  1,084,056  of TCI's then  outstanding  TCI
         Group Series A Common Stock. In July 1998,  Liberty Media Group entered
         into an equity swap  transaction with a commercial bank, which provided
         Liberty  Media Group with the right but not the  obligation  to acquire
         1,084,056 shares of TCI's then outstanding TCI Group Series A Stock for
         approximately  $45 million on or before April 19, 1999.  Liberty  Media
         Group  exercised its right under this equity swap  transaction and used
         the TCI Group  Series A Stock to satisfy the exchange  requirements  of
         the aforementioned preferred stock during the two months ended February
         28, 1999.  In  connection  with such  transaction,  Liberty Media Group
         recorded an $18 million  decrease to combined equity for the difference
         between the exercise price of the right and the carrying  amount of the
         preferred stock.

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, a limited liability company owned by Dr. John
         C. Malone  (Liberty  Media  Group's  Chairman)  acquired,  from certain
         subsidiaries  of Liberty Media Group,  for $17 million,  working cattle
         ranches  located in  Wyoming.  No gain or loss was  recognized  on such
         acquisition.  The  purchase  price was paid by such  limited  liability
         company  in the form of a 12-month  note in the  amount of $17  million
         having an interest rate of 7%. Such note is payable at any time without
         penalty and is personally guaranteed by Dr. Malone.

         In  connection  with the AT&T  Merger,  Liberty  Media  Group  paid two
         directors of Liberty Media  Corporation and one other  individual,  all
         three of whom are  directors  of TCI, an  aggregate  of $12 million for
         services  rendered in connection  with the AT&T Merger.  Such amount is
         included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for
         the two months  ended  February 28, 1999 in the  accompanying  combined
         statements of operations and comprehensive earnings.

         On February 9, 1998, in connection with the settlement of certain legal
         proceedings  relative  to the  Estate  of  Bob  Magness  (the  "Magness
         Estate"), the late founder and former Chairman of the Board of TCI, TCI
         entered into a call  agreement  with Dr.  Malone and Dr.  Malone's wife
         (together with Dr. Malone,  the  "Malones"),  and a call agreement with
         the Estate of Bob Magness,  the Estate of Betsy  Magness,  Gary Magness
         (individually and in certain representative capacities) and Kim Magness
         (individually and in certain representative  capacities) (collectively,
         the "Magness Group"). Under these call agreements,  each of the Magness
         Group and the  Malones  granted to TCI the right to acquire  all of the
         shares of TCI's common stock owned by them ("High Voting  Shares") that
         entitle  the  holder  to  cast  more  than  one  vote  per  share  (the
         "High-Voting  Stock") upon Dr.  Malone's  death or upon a  contemplated
         sale of the  High-Voting  Shares (other than a minimal amount) to third
         parties. In either such event, TCI had the right to acquire such shares
         at a price  equal to the then  market  price of shares of TCI's  common
         stock of the  corresponding  series that entitled the holder to cast no
         more  than one vote per  share  (the  "Low-Voting  Stock"),  plus a 10%
         premium,  or in the case of a sale,  the  lesser of such  price and the
         price  offered by the third  party.  In addition,  each call  agreement
         provides  that if TCI were ever to be sold to a third  party,  then the
         maximum premium that the Magness Group or the Malones would receive for
         their  High-Voting  Shares  would be the price  paid for  shares of the
         relevant  series of  Low-Voting  Stock by the third  party,  plus a 10%
         premium.  Each call  agreement also prohibits any member of the Magness
         Group or the Malones from disposing of their High-Voting Shares, except
         for certain exempt  transfers  (such as transfers to related parties or
         to the other group or public sales of up to an aggregate of 5% of their
         High-Voting  Shares  after  conversion  to  the  respective  series  of
         Low-Voting  Stock) and except for a transfer  made in  compliance  with
         TCI's  purchase  right  described  above.  TCI paid $150 million to the
         Malones and $124 million to the Magness Group in consideration of their
         entering  into the call  agreements,  of  which  an  aggregate  of $140
         million was allocated to and paid by Liberty Media Group.

                                   (continued)

<PAGE>

         Also in February 1998,  TCI, the Magness Group and the Malones  entered
         into a shareholders'  agreement which provides for, among other things,
         certain  participation  rights by the  Magness  Group  with  respect to
         transactions by Dr. Malone, and certain  "tag-along" rights in favor of
         the  Magness  Group  and  certain  "drag-along"  rights in favor of the
         Malones,  with respect to transactions in the High-Voting  Stock.  Such
         agreement  also  provides  that a  representative  of Dr.  Malone and a
         representative of the Magness Group will consult with each other on all
         matters to be brought to a vote of TCI's shareholders,  but if a mutual
         agreement  on how to vote cannot be reached,  Dr.  Malone will vote the
         High-Voting Stock owned by the Magness Group pursuant to an irrevocable
         proxy granted by the Magness Group.

         In connection with the AT&T merger, Liberty Media Group became entitled
         to exercise  TCI's rights and became subject to its  obligations  under
         the call agreement and the shareholders'  agreement with respect to the
         Liberty Media Group Class B tracking  stock acquired by the Malones and
         the  Magness  Group as a result of the AT&T  merger.  If Liberty  Media
         Group were to exercise its call right under the call agreement with the
         Malones or the  Magness  Group,  it may also be  required  to  purchase
         High-Voting  Shares  of the other  group if such  group  exercises  its
         "tag-along" rights under the shareholders' agreement.

(11)     Commitments and Contingencies

         Encore Media Group,  a wholly owned  subsidiary of Liberty Media Group,
         is obligated to pay fees for the rights to exhibit  certain  films that
         are released by various  producers  through  2017 (the "Film  Licensing
         Obligations").  Based  on  customer  levels  at June  30,  1999,  these
         agreements  require minimum  payments  aggregating  approximately  $775
         million.  The aggregate amount of the Film Licensing  Obligations under
         these license agreements is not currently estimable because such amount
         is dependent upon the number of qualifying films released  theatrically
         by certain  motion picture  studios as well as the domestic  theatrical
         exhibition   receipts  upon  the  release  of  such  qualifying  films.
         Nevertheless,  required  aggregate  payments  under the Film  Licensing
         Obligations could prove to be significant.

         Flextech has undertaken to finance the working capital  requirements of
         a joint  venture,  (the  "Principal  Joint  Venture")  formed  with BBC
         Worldwide and is obligated to provide the Principal  Joint Venture with
         a primary  credit  facility of  (pound)88  million  ($139  million) and
         subject to certain restrictions, a standby credit facility of (pound)30
         million ($49 million). As of June 30, 1999, the Principal Joint Venture
         had borrowed  (pound)40  million ($63 million) under the primary credit
         facility.  If  Flextech  defaults  on  its  funding  obligation  to the
         Principal  Joint Venture and fails to cure within 42 days after receipt
         of notice from BBC  Worldwide,  BBC  Worldwide is entitled,  within the
         following 90 days,  to require  that Liberty  Media Group assume all of
         Flextech's funding obligations to the Principal Joint Venture.

         Liberty  Media  Group has  guaranteed  various  loans,  notes  payable,
         letters of credit and other obligations (the "Guaranteed  Obligations")
         of certain  affiliates.  At June 30, 1999, the  Guaranteed  Obligations
         aggregated approximately $377 million.  Currently,  Liberty Media Group
         is not certain of the  likelihood  of being  required to perform  under
         such guarantees.

         Liberty  Media Group  leases  business  offices,  has entered into pole
         rental and  transponder  lease  agreements  and uses certain  equipment
         under lease arrangements.

         On September 21, 1998,  Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico and caused
         considerable property damage to the area in general,  including Liberty
         Media Group's Puerto Rico  subsidiary's  cable television  systems (the
         "Puerto  Rico   Subsidiary").   The  Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary's   cable
         television  systems  represent  $19  million of Liberty  Media  Group's
         revenue for the six months ended June 30, 1999.

         As of June 30, 1999,  approximately 93% of the Puerto Rico Subsidiary's
         pre-hurricane basic customers were receiving cable television services.
         Although  there  can  be  no  assurance,  the  Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary
         estimates that it will regain  substantially  all of its  pre-hurricane
         customer  base by August 31, 1999.  The loss of revenue from  September
         21,  1998  through  June 30,  1999 was $12  million.  The  Puerto  Rico
         Subsidiary's  business  interruption  insurance  covered  the  first $3
         million in lost revenue.

         The Puerto Rico  Subsidiary  has also  claimed  coverage  for  business
         interruption under a secondary  insurance carrier.  Such policy,  which
         covers the Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary's  parent  company's  subsidiaries,
         carries a deductible of $2.5 million.  This insurance  claim is subject
         to approval by such insurance carrier and accordingly, no assurance can
         be given that amounts claimed will be paid in their entirety.  However,
         in the event  such  claims are  collected  the  overall  impact in lost
         revenues  for the  Puerto  Rico  Subsidiary  as a result  of  Hurricane
         Georges will not exceed $2.5 million.

         Liberty  Media  Group  has  contingent  liabilities  related  to  legal
         proceedings  and  other  matters  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of
         business.  Although it is reasonably  possible  Liberty Media Group may
         incur losses upon  conclusion of such matters,  an estimate of any loss
         or range of loss cannot be made.  In the opinion of  management,  it is
         expected  that amounts,  if any,  which may be required to satisfy such
         contingencies  will not be material  in  relation  to the  accompanying
         combined financial statements.

                                   (continued)

         During the six months ended June 30,  1999,  Liberty  Media  Group,  in
         conjunction  with AT&T,  continued its  enterprise-wide,  comprehensive
         efforts  to assess and  remediate  its  computer  systems  and  related
         software and equipment to ensure such  systems,  software and equipment
         recognize,   process  and  store  information  in  the  year  2000  and
         thereafter.  AT&T's year 2000 remediation efforts include an assessment
         of  Liberty  Media  Group's  most  critical  systems,   equipment,  and
         facilities.  AT&T also  continued  its  efforts to verify the year 2000
         readiness of Liberty  Media Group's  significant  suppliers and vendors
         and continued to communicate  with  significant  business  partners and
         affiliates to assess such partners and affiliates' year 2000 status.

         Failure to achieve year 2000  compliance  by Liberty  Media Group,  its
         significant  business  partners  and  affiliates  with  which  it has a
         relationship  could negatively  affect Liberty Media Group's ability to
         conduct business for an extended period. There can be no assurance that
         all of Liberty Media Group's computer systems and related software will
         be fully year 2000  compliant;  in addition,  other  companies on which
         Liberty  Media  Group's  computer  systems  and  related  software  and
         operations  rely may or may not be fully  compliant on a timely  basis,
         and any such failure  could have a material  adverse  effect on Liberty
         Media Group's financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                  June 30, 1999
                                   (unaudited)

(1)      Basis of Presentation
         ---------------------

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
         of   Tele-Communications,   Inc.   and  those  of  all   majority-owned
         subsidiaries ("TCI" or the "Company").  On March 9, 1999, AT&T acquired
         TCI  in  a  merger  transaction  (the  "AT&T  Merger").  For  financial
         reporting   purposes   the  AT&T  Merger  and   related   restructuring
         transactions  described in note 2 are deemed to have  occurred on March
         1, 1999.  The  consolidated  financial  statements for periods prior to
         March 1, 1999 are referred to herein as "Old TCI", and the consolidated
         financial  statements  for periods  subsequent to February 28, 1999 are
         referred  to herein as "New TCI." Due to the March 1, 1999  application
         of  purchase  accounting  in  connection  with  the  AT&T  Merger,  the
         predecessor  consolidated  financial  statements  of Old  TCI  are  not
         comparable to the successor  consolidated  financial  statements of New
         TCI. In the following  text,  "TCI" and "the Company" refer to both Old
         TCI and New TCI. See note 2.

         All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
         eliminated in consolidation.

         The  accompanying   interim   consolidated   financial  statements  are
         unaudited  but, in the opinion of management,  reflect all  adjustments
         (consisting  of  normal  recurring   accruals)  necessary  for  a  fair
         presentation of the results for such periods. The results of operations
         for any interim  period are not  necessarily  indicative of results for
         the full year. These consolidated  financial  statements should be read
         in conjunction  with the  consolidated  financial  statements and notes
         thereto  contained  in TCI's  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K for the year
         ended December 31, 1998.

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements  and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         Prior to the AT&T  Merger,  TCI  generally  recognized  changes  in its
         proportionate  share of the underlying equity of a subsidiary or equity
         method investee,  which resulted from the issuance of additional equity
         securities by such subsidiary or equity  investee,  in the consolidated
         statement of  operations.  Upon  consummation  of the AT&T Merger,  TCI
         began to  account  for such  changes  in the  underlying  equity of its
         subsidiaries and affiliates as equity  transactions in order to conform
         with AT&T's accounting policy.

         Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified for  comparability
         with the 1999 presentation.

         Targeted Stock
         --------------

         Prior to the AT&T Merger,  the  Company's  assets and  operations  were
         included in three separate groups, each of which was tracked separately
         by public equity  securities.  These groups were formerly  known as the
         "Liberty Media Group"  (referred to herein as the "Old Liberty Group"),
         the "TCI Ventures Group" and the "TCI Group."

         Old Liberty Group was intended to reflect the separate  performance  of
         TCI's assets which produce and distribute programming services.

         The TCI Ventures Group was intended to reflect the separate performance
         of  TCI's   principal   international   assets   and   businesses   and
         substantially all of TCI's non-cable and non-programming assets.

         The TCI Group was intended to reflect the separate  performance  of TCI
         and its  subsidiaries and assets not attributed to Old Liberty Group or
         TCI  Ventures  Group.   Such  subsidiaries  and  assets  are  comprised
         primarily of TCI's domestic cable and communications business.

         TCI Group, Old Liberty Group and TCI Ventures Group individually may be
         referred to herein as a "Group."

         The TCI Group was tracked separately  through the  Tele-Communications,
         Inc.  Series A TCI Group  Common Stock (the "TCI Group Series A Stock")
         and Series B TCI Group  Common  Stock (the "TCI Group  Series B Stock,"
         and together with the TCI Group Series A Stock, the "TCI Group Stock").
         The Old Liberty Group was tracked through the Tele-Communications, Inc.
         Series A Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock  ("Liberty  Group Series A
         Stock") and Series B Liberty Media Group Common Stock  ("Liberty  Group
         Series B Stock" and together with the Liberty Group Series A Stock, the
         "Liberty Group Stock").  The TCI Ventures Group was tracked  separately
         through  the  Tele-Communications,  Inc.  Series A TCI  Ventures  Group
         Common  Stock ("TCI  Ventures  Group  Series A Stock") and Series B TCI
         Ventures  Group Common Stock ("TCI  Ventures  Group Series B Stock" and
         together with the TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock,  the "TCI Ventures
         Group Stock").

         Upon  consummation  of the AT&T Merger,  each of the separate series of
         Tele-Communications, Inc. common stock was converted either into shares
         of AT&T common stock, par value $1.00 per share,  ("AT&T Common Stock")
         or shares of one of two classes of a new AT&T tracking stock designated
         to track the  combined Old Liberty  Group and TCI Ventures  Group after
         giving effect to certain asset transfers. See note 2.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         Following the AT&T Merger,  the  authorized  capital of TCI consists of
         3,552,375,096  shares,  consisting  of  3,550,000,000  shares of common
         stock,  par value $.01 per share,  and  2,375,096  shares of  preferred
         stock,  par value $.01 per share  ("Preferred  Stock").  The  Preferred
         Stock is divided into two classes:  700,000 shares of Class A Preferred
         Stock,  par value $.01 per share,  and  1,675,096  shares of Class B 6%
         Cumulative  Redeemable  Exchangeable  Junior Preferred Stock, par value
         $.01 per share ("Class B Preferred Stock").

(2)      Merger with AT&T and Related Accounting
         ---------------------------------------

         On March 9, 1999, AT&T acquired TCI in the AT&T Merger,  in which Italy
         Merger Corp., a wholly-owned  subsidiary of AT&T,  merged with and into
         TCI, and TCI thereby  became a subsidiary  of AT&T.  As a result of the
         AT&T Merger,  (i) each share of TCI Group Series A Stock was  converted
         into 1.16355 shares of AT&T Common Stock,  (ii) each share of TCI Group
         Series B Stock was converted  into 1.27995 shares of AT&T Common Stock,
         (iii) each share of Liberty Group Series A Stock was  converted  into 2
         shares (as adjusted for a June 1999 two-for-one stock split) of a newly
         created  class of AT&T common stock  designated  as the Class A Liberty
         Media Group Common Stock,  par value $1.00 per share (the "AT&T Liberty
         Class A Tracking  Stock"),  (iv) each share of Liberty  Group  Series B
         Stock was  converted  into 2 shares (as  adjusted for a June 1999 stock
         split) of a newly created class of AT&T common stock  designated as the
         Class B Liberty  Media Group  Common  Stock,  par value $1.00 per share
         (the "AT&T Liberty  Class B Tracking  Stock" and together with the AT&T
         Liberty Class A Tracking Stock, the "AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock"), (v)
         each share of TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock was converted into 1.04
         shares of AT&T Liberty  Class A Tracking  Stock (as adjusted for a June
         1999 stock split), (vi) each share of TCI Ventures Group Series B Stock
         was converted  into 1.04 shares of AT&T Liberty Class B Tracking  Stock
         (as adjusted for a June 1999 two-for-one stock split), (vii) each share
         of TCI's Convertible  Preferred Stock,  Series C-TCI Group (the "Series
         C-TCI Group Preferred  Stock") was converted into 154.589253  shares of
         AT&T Common  Stock,  (viii) each share of TCI's  Convertible  Preferred
         Stock Series  C-Liberty Media Group (the "Series  C-Liberty Media Group
         Preferred  Stock") was  converted  into 112.50  shares of AT&T  Liberty
         Class A Tracking Stock (as adjusted for a June 1999  two-for-one  stock
         split),  (ix)  each  share of TCI's  Redeemable  Convertible  TCI Group
         Preferred  Stock,  Series G ("Series G Preferred  Stock") was converted
         into 1.3846245  shares of AT&T Common Stock and (x) each share of TCI's
         Redeemable  Convertible  Liberty Media Group Preferred Stock,  Series H
         ("Series H Preferred  Stock") was converted into 1.18125 shares of AT&T
         Liberty Class A Tracking Stock (as adjusted for a June 1999 two-for-one
         stock  split).  Following  the  AT&T  Merger,  each  share  of  Class B
         Preferred  Stock  continues to be  outstanding as the Class B Preferred
         Stock of TCI with the same rights and preferences  such stock had prior
         to the AT&T Merger.  In general,  the holders of shares of AT&T Liberty
         Class A Tracking  Stock and the holders of shares of AT&T Liberty Class
         B Tracking  Stock will vote together as a single class with the holders
         of  shares  of AT&T  Common  Stock  on all  matters  presented  to such
         stockholders,  with the holders being  entitled to 3/40th of a vote for
         each share of AT&T  Liberty  Class A Tracking  Stock held,  3/4ths of a
         vote per share of AT&T Liberty  Class B Tracking  Stock held and 1 vote
         per share of AT&T Common Stock held.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



         The shares of AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock issued in the AT&T Merger are
         intended to reflect the  separate  performance  of the  businesses  and
         assets  attributed to Old Liberty  Group and TCI Ventures  Group at the
         time of the AT&T Merger.  References herein to "Liberty/Ventures Group"
         refer to the combined  assets and  businesses  of Old Liberty Group and
         TCI Ventures Group for periods prior to the AT&T Merger, and subsequent
         to the AT&T Merger such combined assets and business are referred to as
         "Liberty  Media  Group."  Pursuant  to,  and  subject  to the terms and
         conditions  set forth in the  Agreement and Plan of  Restructuring  and
         Merger, dated as of June 23, 1998 (the "Merger Agreement"), immediately
         prior to the AT&T Merger,  certain assets previously  attributed to TCI
         Ventures  Group  (including,  among  others,  the shares of AT&T Common
         Stock received in the merger of AT&T and Teleport Communications Group,
         Inc. ("TCG"), the stock of At Home Corporation  ("@Home") attributed to
         TCI Ventures  Group,  the assets and  business of the National  Digital
         Television  Center,  Inc.  ("NDTC")  and TCI  Ventures  Group's  equity
         interest   in  Western   Tele-Communications,   Inc.   ("WTCI"))   were
         transferred to TCI Group in exchange for approximately  $5.5 billion in
         cash.  Also, upon  consummation  of the AT&T Merger,  through a new tax
         sharing agreement  between Liberty Media Group and AT&T,  Liberty Media
         Group became entitled to the benefit of  approximately  $2.0 billion of
         net operating loss carryforwards  attributable to all entities included
         in TCI's  consolidated  federal income tax return as of the date of the
         AT&T  Merger.  Such net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are subject to
         adjustment  by  the  Internal   Revenue  Service  and  are  subject  to
         limitations  on usage which may affect the  ultimate  amount  utilized.
         Additionally,   certain   warrants  to   purchase   shares  of  General
         Instruments  Corporation ("GI") previously attributed to TCI Group were
         transferred  to  Liberty/Ventures  Group in exchange for  approximately
         $176  million in cash.  The transfer of certain  immaterial  assets was
         also effected.

         Immediately   prior  to  the  AT&T  Merger,   AT&T  and  Liberty  Media
         Corporation  entered  into an  agreement  relating  to the  carriage of
         programming  of Liberty  Media  Group to be  distributed  over the AT&T
         cable systems. Pursuant to this agreement,  Liberty Media Group will be
         granted, among other rights,  "preferred vendor status" with respect to
         certain  types of new  programming  services.  Liberty Media Group will
         also  be  entitled  to the use of  channel  capacity  equal  to one six
         megahertz  channel to be used for category  specific  interactive video
         channels.  In addition,  such agreement also provided for the extension
         of  existing   affiliation   agreements  between  TCI  and  programming
         affiliates of Liberty Media Group to a date not less than 10 years from
         the closing of the AT&T Merger, upon the terms and conditions set forth
         in such agreement.

         Pursuant to amended  corporate  governance  documents  for the entities
         included in Liberty Media Group and certain  agreements  among AT&T and
         TCI, the business of Liberty Media Group will continue to be managed by
         certain persons who were members of TCI's  management prior to the AT&T
         Merger.  AT&T will  initially  designate  one third of the directors of
         such  entities  and its  rights as the sole  shareholder  of the common
         stock of such  entities  following  the AT&T Merger will, in accordance
         with Delaware law, be limited to actions which will require shareholder
         approval. Therefore,  management has concluded that TCI does not have a
         controlling  financial  interest  (as that term is used in Statement of
         Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 94) in the entities comprising the
         Liberty Media Group following the AT&T Merger, and will account for its
         ownership interests in such entities under the equity method.

                                   (continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



         Immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, TCI restructured its ownership of
         certain of its subsidiaries  (the  "Restructuring").  The Restructuring
         included  merging  TCI's cable  subsidiary,  TCI  Communications,  Inc.
         ("TCIC"),  into TCI. As a result of TCIC's  merger with TCI, all assets
         and  liabilities  of TCIC have been  assumed by TCI,  including  TCIC's
         public debt. In  connection  with TCIC's merger with TCI, each share of
         TCIC's Cumulative  Exchangeable Preferred Stock, Series A was converted
         into 2.119 shares of TCI Group  Series A Stock,  and such shares of TCI
         Group Series A Stock were subsequently converted into AT&T Common Stock
         in connection with the AT&T Merger.  All other public securities issued
         by  subsidiaries of TCIC (other than TCI Pacific  Communications,  Inc.
         ("Pacific")) otherwise remained unaffected. Furthermore, as part of the
         Restructuring,   (i)  AT&T  loaned  TCI  $5.5  billion  pursuant  to  a
         promissory note, (ii) certain asset transfers were made between TCI and
         its  subsidiaries,  (iii) 123,896  shares of the Company's  Convertible
         Redeemable Participating Preferred Stock, Series F ("Series F Preferred
         Stock") which were held by  subsidiaries  of TCI, were  converted  into
         185,428,946  shares  of TCI  Group  Series A Stock  (which in turn were
         converted  into  215,755,850  shares of AT&T  Common  Stock in the AT&T
         Merger  and  continue  to be held by  subsidiaries  of  TCI),  (iv) the
         remaining  154,411  shares  of  Series F  Preferred  Stock  which  were
         formerly held by subsidiaries of TCI were  distributed to TCI through a
         series of liquidations and canceled,  and (v) 125,728,816 shares of TCI
         Group  Series A Stock,  9,154,134  shares of TCI Group  Series B Stock,
         6,654,367  shares of Liberty Group Series A Stock,  3,417,187 shares of
         Liberty  Group Series B Stock,  and 67,536  shares of Class B Preferred
         Stock,  each formerly held by subsidiaries of TCI, were  distributed to
         TCI through a series of liquidations and canceled.

         Under  the  terms  of the 5%  Class A  Senior  Cumulative  Exchangeable
         Preferred Stock of Pacific (the "Exchangeable  Preferred Stock"),  each
         share of that preferred stock is exchangeable, from and after August 1,
         2001, for approximately  6.3375 shares of AT&T Common Stock, subject to
         certain anti-dilution adjustments.  Additionally,  Pacific may elect to
         make  any   dividend,   redemption  or   liquidation   payment  on  the
         Exchangeable  Preferred  Stock in cash,  by  delivery of shares of AT&T
         Common  Stock  or  by  a  combination   of  the   foregoing   forms  of
         consideration.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



         The AT&T Merger has been  accounted  for using the  purchase  method of
         accounting  and has been deemed to be effective as of March 1, 1999 for
         financial reporting purposes.  Accordingly,  the preliminary allocation
         of AT&T's purchase price to acquire Old TCI has been reflected in TCI's
         consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  March  1,  1999.  A  final
         allocation  of such  purchase  price  will be made upon  resolution  of
         pre-acquisition   contingencies   and  receipt  of  final  third  party
         appraisals.  Certain  transactions  occurring between March 1, 1999 and
         March 9, 1999 that  affected  Old TCI's  equity and stock  compensation
         have been  reflected in the two-month  period ended  February 28, 1999.
         The $52.2  billion  aggregate  value  assigned to TCI's net assets as a
         result of the  application of purchase  accounting was comprised of the
         following (amounts in millions):

         The value  assigned to the AT&T  Common  Stock was based on the average
         closing price of AT&T Common Stock a few days before and after the AT&T
         Merger  was agreed to and  announced.  The value  assigned  to the AT&T
         Liberty  Tracking  Stock  was  based on the  average  closing  price of
         Liberty  Group  Stock a few days  before and after the AT&T  Merger was
         agreed to and announced.  The Liberty Group Stock was used to value the
         AT&T Liberty  Tracking Stock issued in the AT&T Merger because the fair
         value of Liberty  Group Stock was more  readily  determinable  than the
         fair value of the AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         As a result of the  application  of  purchase  accounting,  New TCI has
         recorded its assets and liabilities at their preliminary fair values on
         March 9, 1999.  Certain  of the more  significant  effects of  purchase
         accounting are described below.

         The $25 billion assigned to New TCI's intangible assets, as of March 1,
         1999, is primarily  comprised of goodwill and is being  amortized  over
         the  estimated  useful  lives of such assets,  primarily 40 years.  New
         TCI's  intangible  assets  in the March 1,  1999  opening  consolidated
         balance  sheet also  include $594  million of  in-process  research and
         development   costs.   Such  amount  reflects  the  value,  as  of  the
         acquisition  date, of the Company's  research and development  projects
         which had not yet reached  technological  feasibility  and which had no
         alternative future use. Such in-process  research and development costs
         were written-off during March 1999.

         As a result of the  application  of  purchase  accounting,  the  amount
         assigned to New TCI's other  liabilities  includes  $237 million  which
         represents   New  TCI's   estimated   liability   for  unvested   stock
         appreciation   rights  as  of  March  9,  1999.   Such  unvested  stock
         appreciation  rights will vest over remaining periods ranging from 1 to
         5 years. The amount assigned to New TCI's minority  interests in equity
         of consolidated subsidiaries includes $2.1 billion which represents the
         fair  value of the  redeemable  preferred  stock of a  subsidiary.  For
         additional  information regarding the effects of purchase accounting on
         New TCI's assets and liabilities, see notes 6, 8 and 9.

 (3)     Earnings (Loss) Per Common and Potential Common Share
         -----------------------------------------------------

         Basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS") is  measured  as the income or loss
         attributable  to common  stockholders  divided by the weighted  average
         outstanding  common  shares for the  period.  Diluted EPS is similar to
         basic EPS but  presents  the  dilutive  effect on a per share  basis of
         potential  common shares as if they had been converted at the beginning
         of  the  periods  presented.  Potential  common  shares  that  have  an
         anti-dilutive  effect are excluded from diluted EPS.  Basic and diluted
         EPS are presented only for periods prior to the AT&T Merger. Subsequent
         to the AT&T Merger, all shares of common stock of TCI are held by AT&T.
         See notes 1 and 2.

                  ---------------

                  The basic  earnings  (loss)  attributable  to TCI Group common

                  February  28, 1999 and the three and six month  periods  ended
                  June 30, 1998 was  computed by dividing  net  earnings  (loss)
                  attributable to TCI Group common  stockholders by the weighted
                  average number of common shares outstanding of TCI Group Stock
                  during the period.

                  The diluted loss attributable to TCI Group common stockholders
                  per common  share for the two months  ended  February 28, 1999
                  was  computed by dividing net loss  attributable  to TCI Group
                  common stockholders, which is increased by aggregate fees paid
                  on equity swap  facilities  of $4 million  during 1999, by the
                  weighted  average  number of common shares  outstanding of TCI
                  Group Stock during the period.  Potential  common  shares were
                  not included in the  computation  of weighted  average  shares
                  outstanding because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

                  The  diluted   earnings   attributable  to  TCI  Group  common
                  stockholders  per common  share for the six months  ended June
                  30, 1998 was computed by dividing net earnings attributable to
                  TCI  Group  common  stockholders,  which  is  adjusted  by the
                  addition of preferred  stock  dividends  and interest  accrued
                  during the six months  ended  June 30,  1998 to net  earnings,
                  assuming conversion of TCI Group convertible  securities as of
                  the beginning of the period, by the weighted average number of
                  common  shares  outstanding  of TCI  Group  Stock  during  the
                  period.  Shares  issuable upon  conversion of the Series C-TCI
                  Group Preferred Stock, the Series G Preferred Stock, preferred
                  stock of subsidiaries,  convertible  notes payable,  and stock
                  options and other performance awards have been included in the
                  computation of weighted average shares, as illustrated  below.
                  Shares of TCI Group Stock  issuable  upon  exercise of certain
                  stock  rights,  and issuable upon  conversion  of  Convertible
                  Preferred  Stock,  Series D ("Series D  Preferred  Stock") and
                  associated dividend payments for the six months ended June 30,
                  1998  have been  excluded  as  adjustments  in  computing  the
                  diluted earnings attributable to TCI Group common shareholders
                  per common share as Series D Preferred  Stock is  antidilutive
                  for the six months ended June 30, 1998. All of the outstanding
                  shares of Series D  Preferred  Stock were  redeemed  effective
                  April 1, 1998.

                  The diluted loss attributable to TCI Group common stockholders
                  per common  share for the three months ended June 30, 1998 was
                  computed by dividing net loss attributable to TCI Group common
                  stockholders  by the weighted  average number of common shares
                  outstanding  of TCI Group Stock  during the period.  Potential
                  common shares were not included in the computation of weighted
                  average shares  outstanding  because their  inclusion would be
                  anti-dilutive.

                  In  connection  with the March 9, 1999 AT&T Merger,  TCI Group
                  Stock was converted into AT&T Common Stock. See note 2.

         (b)      Liberty Group Stock
                  -------------------

                  The basic earnings  (loss)  attributable  to Old Liberty Group
                  common  stockholders per common share for the two months ended
                  February  28, 1999 and the three and six month  periods  ended
                  June 30, 1998 and the diluted loss attributable to Old Liberty
                  Group  common  stockholders  per common and  potential  common
                  share  for  the two  months  ended  February  28,  1999,  were
                  computed by dividing net earnings  (loss)  attributable to Old
                  Liberty  Group common  stockholders  by the  weighted  average
                  number of common  shares  outstanding  of Liberty  Group Stock
                  during the period.  Potential  common shares were not included
                  in the diluted  computation of weighted average shares for the
                  two months ended  February 28, 1999  because  their  inclusion
                  would be anti-dilutive.

                  The diluted earnings  attributable to Old Liberty Group common
                  stockholders per common and potential common share for the six
                  months ended June 30, 1998 were computed by dividing  earnings
                  attributable  to Old Liberty Group common  stockholders by the
                  weighted  average number of common and potential common shares
                  outstanding  of Liberty Group Stock during the period.  Shares
                  issuable upon  conversion of the Series  C-Liberty Media Group
                  Preferred  Stock,  the Series D Preferred  Stock, the Series H
                  Preferred Stock,  convertible notes payable, stock options and
                  other  performance  awards  have been  included in the diluted
                  calculation of weighted average shares, as illustrated  below.
                  All of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock were
                  redeemed  effective April 1, 1998.  Numerator  adjustments for
                  dividends  and  interest   associated   with  the  convertible
                  preferred shares and convertible notes payable,  respectively,
                  were not made to the computation of diluted earnings per share
                  as such dividends and interest were paid by TCI Group.

                  The diluted  loss  attributable  to Old Liberty  Group  common
                  stockholders  per common share for the three months ended June
                  30, 1998 was computed by dividing the net loss attributable to
                  Old Liberty Group  stockholders by the weighted average number
                  of common shares outstanding of Liberty Group Stock during the
                  period.  Potential  common  shares  were not  included  in the
                  computation  of weighted  average shares  outstanding  because
                  their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

                  In  connection  with the AT&T Merger,  Liberty Group Stock was
                  converted into AT&T Liberty Tracking Stock. See note 2.

                  increased  by $29  million for  charges  recorded  directly to
                  equity upon settlement of an equity swap transaction. See note
                  10. For  purposes  of  computing  diluted  EPS such  amount is
                  assumed to be charged to  earnings.  Potential  common  shares
                  were not  included  in the  computation  of  weighted  average
                  shares   outstanding   because   their   inclusion   would  be
                  anti-dilutive.

                  In connection with the March 9, 1999 AT&T Merger, TCI Ventures
                  Group Stock was converted  into AT&T Liberty  Tracking  Stock.

         (a)      CSC

                  On March 4, 1998,  the Company  contributed  to CSC certain of
                  its cable  television  systems serving  approximately  830,000
                  customers in exchange  for  approximately  48.9 million  newly
                  issued CSC Class A common shares (the "CSC Transaction").  CSC
                  also  assumed and repaid  approximately  $574  million of debt
                  owed by the  Company to  external  parties  and $95 million of
                  debt owed to the Company.  As a result of the CSC Transaction,
                  the Company recognized a $506 million gain in the accompanying
                  consolidated  statement of operations for the six months ended
                  June 30, 1998.  Such gain  represents the excess of the $1,161
                  million fair value of the CSC Class A common  shares  received
                  over the historical cost of the net assets  transferred by the
                  Company to CSC.

                  The Company has also  entered  into letters of intent with CSC
                  which  provide  for the  Company to acquire a cable  system in
                  Michigan and an  additional  4% of CSC's Class A common shares
                  and for CSC to (i) acquire cable systems serving approximately
                  250,000  customers in Connecticut and (ii) assume $110 million
                  of liabilities.

                  $70.00  per share on such date.  Such  shares  represented  an
                  approximate  32% equity  interest in CSC's  total  outstanding
                  shares and an  approximate  9% voting  interest  in CSC in all

                  proportion  with  the  public  holders  of CSC  Class A common
                  shares.  The ability of the  Company to sell or  increase  its
                  investment  in CSC is  subject  to  certain  restrictions  and
                  limitations set forth in a stockholders agreement with CSC. As
                  a  result  of the  deconsolidation  of  Liberty  Media  Group,
                  1,040,400  shares of CSC Class A common  stock held by Liberty
                  Media Group are no longer included in the Company's investment
                  in CSC. See note 2.

         (b)      @Home

                  During the second quarter of 1999, the  stockholders  of @Home
                  approved certain changes in the corporate governance of @Home.
                  As a result of these  changes,  management  has concluded that
                  TCI no longer holds a controlling  financial interest (as that
                  term is used in Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards
                  No. 94) in @Home and,  accordingly,  during the second quarter
                  of 1999, TCI ceased to consolidate  @Home and began to account
                  for @Home using the equity method of accounting.

                  On May 28, 1999,  @Home  consummated a merger  agreement  with
                  Excite, Inc. ("Excite"),  a global Internet media company that
                  offers  consumers  and  advertisers   comprehensive   Internet
                  navigation    services    with    extensive    personalization
                  capabilities.  Under the terms of the merger agreement,  @Home
                  issued  approximately  116 million  shares of its common stock
                  (as adjusted for a June 1999 two-for-one  stock split) for all
                  of the outstanding common stock of Excite based on an exchange
                  ratio of 2.083804  shares of @Home's common stock (as adjusted
                  for a June 1999  two-for-one  stock  split)  for each share of
                  Excite's common stock.  @Home may issue up to approximately 46
                  million  additional  shares of common stock (as adjusted for a
                  June 1999  two-for-one  stock  split) in  connection  with the
                  assumption  of  obligations  under  Excite's  stock option and
                  employer stock purchase plans and outstanding  warrants.  As a
                  result  of  the  merger,  TCI's  economic  interest  in  @Home
                  decreased  from 38% to 26%. Due to the  resulting  increase in
                  @Home's  equity,  net  of  the  dilution  of  TCI's  ownership
                  interest in @Home,  TCI  recorded a $466  million  increase to
                  "Additional  paid-in  capital" and a $298 million  increase to
                  "Deferred income tax liability." At June 30, 1999, the Company
                  owned  63,720,000  shares  of @Home  Class A common  stock (as
                  adjusted for a June 1999 two-for-one stock split), which had a
                  closing market price of $53.94 per share on such date.

                  During the two months ended  February  28, 1999,  @Home issued
                  2.2  million  common  shares  (as  adjusted  for a  June  1999
                  two-for-one  stock split).  Due to the  resulting  increase in
                  @Home's  equity,  net  of  the  dilution  of  TCI's  ownership
                  interest in @Home, TCI recognized a gain of $17 million.

         (c)      Liberty Media Group Investments

                  As a result of the deconsolidation of Liberty Media Group, the
                  indicated  investments are no longer included in the Company's
                  consolidated investments. See note 2.

         At June  30,  1999,  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of the  Company's
         investments in the Other  Affiliates  exceeded the Company's  aggregate
         proportionate share of the Other Affiliates' underlying equity by $11.2
         billion, of which $5.4 billion,  $4.2 billion and $1.6 billion is being
         amortized over 40 years, 25 years and 7 years, respectively.

         TCI has entered into various  agreements,  which,  among other matters,
         contemplate  the disposition of certain of its investments in the Other
         Affiliates. See note 7.

         Summarized  unaudited  combined  results  of  operations  for the Other
         Affiliates  for the periods in which the Company used the equity method

(7)      Acquisitions and Dispositions
         -----------------------------

         On May 4, 1999, AT&T and Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") announced that
         they had signed a letter of intent to exchange  various cable  systems,
         including  certain  cable  systems of TCI. In  addition,  Comcast  will
         receive an option  from AT&T to  purchase,  over the next three  years,
         additional  cable  systems with a total of  approximately  1.25 million
         subscribers,  which may include cable subscribers of TCI. The foregoing
         agreements are subject to completion of certain other transactions, and
         regulatory and legal approvals.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         On May 4, 1999,  AT&T and  Lenfest  announced  that they have signed an
         agreement for AT&T to acquire the remaining 50% interest in Lenfest not
         already owned by TCI. Lenfest has  approximately  1.5 million customers
         in the greater  Philadelphia  area. AT&T has agreed to a stock purchase
         of the  remaining  ownership  interest,  and expects to issue shares of
         AT&T Common  Stock to Lenfest  valued at  approximately  $2.2  billion,
         subject to  purchase  price  adjustments.  The number of shares of AT&T
         Common Stock  issued to Lenfest will be based on the average  price per
         share of AT&T  Common  Stock  during the sixty day period  prior to the
         closing date. The  transaction is subject to receipt of necessary legal
         and  regulatory  approvals.   No  assurance  can  be  given  that  such
         transaction will be consummated. See note 6.

         On July 6, 1999, AT&T and Cox  Communications,  Inc.  ("Cox") signed an
         agreement whereby AT&T would redeem  approximately  50.3 million shares
         of AT&T  Common  Stock  held by Cox in  exchange  for cable  television
         systems  of TCI  serving  approximately  316,000  customers  and  TCI's
         interest in certain  equity  method  investments.  The  transaction  is
         subject to receipt of necessary government and regulatory approvals. No
         assurance can be given that such transaction  will be consummated.  See
         note 6.

         TCI has entered  into  agreements  with  Century  Communications  Corp.
         ("Century")  whereby  TCI  will  contribute  cable  television  systems
         serving  approximately 249,000 customers located in Southern California
         to a newly  formed  limited  partnership  in  which  TCI  will  have an
         approximate 25% partnership  interest.  TCI will also exchange with the
         new  partnership,  a  cable  television  system  serving  approximately
         100,000 customers in Southern  California for cable television  systems
         in Northern  California serving  approximately  100,000 customers.  The
         transactions  are subject to various closing  conditions.  No assurance
         can be given that such transactions will be consummated.

         During  the  second  quarter  of  1999,  the  Company  entered  into an
         agreement  for  the   acquisition  by  Charter   Communications,   Inc.
         ("Charter")  and TCI of  certain  cable  television  systems  owned  by
         InterMedia IV and InterMedia  Partners.  Charter will pay consideration
         consisting  of cash and cable  television  systems  for the  systems it
         acquires  from  InterMedia  IV. TCI will  acquire  certain  other cable
         systems  in a  non-cash  transaction.  Upon  the  consummation  of  the
         transactions,  TCI  will  own  all  of  the  partnership  interests  in
         InterMedia IV and InterMedia Partners.  The transactions are subject to
         various  closing  conditions.  No  assurance  can be  given  that  such
         transactions will be consummated. See notes 6 and 12.

         During the second quarter of 1999, TCI entered into separate agreements
         to sell the  majority  of its 50%  interest  in Bresnan  Communications
         Group LLC (the  "Bresnan  Transaction")  and its 46% interest in Falcon
         Communications,   L.P.  (the  "Falcon   Transaction")  to  Charter.  In
         accordance with the terms of the Bresnan Transaction, TCI would receive
         consideration of approximately $900 million in the form of cash, and an
         approximate  4.5% interest in a new entity to be formed by Charter.  In
         accordance with the terms of the Falcon Transaction,  TCI would receive
         cash proceeds of approximately  $725 million for its interest in Falcon
         Communications,  L.P. The  transactions  are subject to various closing
         conditions.  No assurance can be given that such  transactions  will be
         consummated. See note 6

         During the second quarter of 1999, the Company paid $40 million in cash
         and traded  cable  television  systems  serving  approximately  618,000
         customers located in Florida,  Hawaii, Maine, New York, Ohio, Texas and
         Wisconsin in exchange for cable systems serving  approximately  565,000
         customers located in Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon and Pennsylvania (the
         "1999  Exchange").  The 1999  Exchange was  consummated  pursuant to an
         agreement that was executed in November 1998. No gain was recognized on
         the  1999  Exchange  due  to  the  Company's  application  of  purchase
         accounting in connection with the AT&T Merger.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         During the two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company  completed a
         transaction whereby the Company contributed cable television systems to
         an  entity  in which  the  Company  had an  approximate  80%  ownership
         interest. Through a series of transactions,  including the contribution
         of cash by a third party in exchange for an  ownership  interest in the
         entity,  the  Company's   ownership  interest  in  such  majority-owned
         subsidiary was reduced to a non-controlling 50% ownership interest (the
         "1999  Contribution  Transaction").  In connection  with the associated
         dilution   of   the   Company's   ownership   interest,   the   Company
         deconsolidated  assets  and  liabilities  related  to cable  television
         systems serving  approximately  614,000  customers.  The deconsolidated
         liabilities  included $210 million of debt owed to external parties and
         $709 million of  intercompany  debt owed to the Company.  In connection
         with the 1999 Contribution Transaction,  the Company has agreed to take
         certain  steps to support  compliance  by such  entity with its payment
         obligations under certain debt instruments. See note 13. As a result of
         the dilution of the Company's  ownership  interest from 80% to 50%, the
         Company recorded a $9 million increase (net of deferred income taxes of
         $5 million) to additional  paid-in  capital in connection with the 1999
         Contribution  Transaction.  No gain was recognized due to the Company's
         aforementioned  commitment to support the entity's payment  obligations
         under certain debt instruments.

         During February 1999, the Company sold cable television  assets serving
         approximately  145,000  customers  to an  unaffiliated  third party for
         approximately $300 million. The Company recorded a $123 million gain on
         such disposition.

         During the year ended 1998, the Company completed various  transactions
         in addition to the CSC  Transaction  described  in note 6,  wherein the
         Company  contributed cable television  systems serving in the aggregate
         approximately   1.9  million   customers  to  several  joint   ventures
         (collectively,   the   "1998   Joint   Ventures")   in   exchange   for
         non-controlling ownership interests in each of the 1998 Joint Ventures,
         and the  assumption  and  repayment by the 1998 Joint  Ventures of debt
         owed by the Company to external  parties  aggregating  $323 million and
         intercompany debt owed to the Company  aggregating  $2,374 million.  In
         connection  with such  transactions,  the  Company  has  agreed to take
         certain  steps to support  compliance  by the 1998 Joint  Ventures with
         their payment  obligations under certain debt instruments.  See notes 6
         and 13.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         Effective  February 28, 1999, TV Guide (formerly United Video Satellite
         Group, Inc.  ("UVSG")) and The News Corporation  Limited ("News Corp.")
         completed a transaction  whereby News Corp.'s TV Guide  properties were
         combined with UVSG to create a platform for offering  television  guide
         services to consumers and  advertising  and the  resulting  company was
         named  TV  Guide.  As part of this  combination,  a unit of News  Corp.
         received  consideration  consisting  of $800  million  in  cash  and 60
         million  shares of UVSG's stock,  including  22.5 million shares of its
         Class A common  stock  and 37.5  million  shares  of its Class B common
         stock. In addition,  News Corp.  elected to purchase  approximately 6.5
         million additional shares of UVSG Class A common stock for $129 million
         in order to equalize its ownership with that of Liberty/Ventures Group.
         Prior to such  transactions,  UVSG was a subsidiary of TCI. As a result
         of these transactions,  and another  transaction  completed on the same
         date,  News  Corp.,   Liberty/Ventures  Group  and  TV  Guide's  public
         stockholders own on an economic basis  approximately  44%, 44% and 12%,
         respectively, of TV Guide. Following such transactions,  News Corp. and
         Liberty/Ventures  Group each have approximately 49% of the voting power
         of TV Guide's  outstanding  stock. Due to the resulting  increase in TV
         Guide's equity,  net of the dilution of TCI's ownership  interest in TV
         Guide,  TCI recognized a $372 million gain (before  deducting  deferred
         income tax expense of $147 million).

         Effective  February  1, 1998,  Turner-Vision,  Inc.  ("Turner  Vision")
         contributed the assets, obligations and operations of its retail C-band
         satellite business to Superstar/Netlink Group LLC ("Superstar/Netlink")
         in exchange for an approximate 20% interest in Superstar/Netlink.  As a
         result  of  this  transaction,  the  Company's  ownership  interest  in
         Superstar/Netlink  decreased  from  100% to  approximately  80% and the
         Company  recognized a gain of $38 million  (before  deducting  deferred
         income tax expense of $15 million).  Turner  Vision's  contribution  to
         Superstar/Netlink was accounted for as a purchase,  and the $61 million
         excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired
         was recorded as goodwill.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         (b)      During  the  two months ended  February 28, 1999, the  Company
                  redeemed   certain   notes  payable  which  had  an  aggregate
                  principal  balance of $21  million  and fixed  interest  rates
                  ranging  from  8.75%  to  9.25%.   In  connection   with  such
                  redemptions,  the Company  recognized  a pre-tax loss on early
                  extinguishment  of debt  of $4  million  in  1999.  Such  loss
                  related to prepayment penalties and the retirement of deferred
                  loan costs.

                  During  the six  months  ended  June  30,  1998,  the  Company
                  redeemed   certain   notes  payable  which  had  an  aggregate
                  principal  balance of $299  million and fixed  interest  rates
                  ranging  from  8.67%  to  10.125%.  In  connection  with  such
                  redemptions,  the Company  recognized  a pre-tax loss on early
                  extinguishment  of debt of $38  million  in  1998.  Such  loss
                  related to prepayment  penalties  amounting to $34 million and
                  the retirement of deferred loan costs.

         (c)      During  the  two months  ended February 28, 1999, the  Company
                  repaid  a  bank  credit  facility.  In  connection  with  such
                  repayment,  the  Company  recognized  a pre-tax  loss on early
                  extinguishment of debt of $4 million. Such loss related to the
                  retirement of deferred loan costs.

                  As  security  for  borrowings  under one of Old  TCI's  credit
                  facilities,  Old TCI had  pledged a portion of its Time Warner
                  common  stock.   As  a  result  of  the   deconsolidation   of
                  Liberty/Ventures  Group,  such  borrowings  and the associated
                  Time  Warner  common  stock  are no  longer  reflected  in the
                  Company's consolidated debt and asset balances.

         (d)      The  convertible  notes, which were stated  net of unamortized
                  discount of $166 million at December 31, 1998,  were scheduled
                  to mature on December 12, 2021.  The notes  required an annual
                  interest  payment  equal to 1.85%  of the face  amount  of the
                  notes. On March 26, 1999, all of the notes were converted into
                  shares of AT&T Common  Stock,  AT&T  Liberty  Class A Tracking
                  Stock and TCI Satellite  Entertainment,  Inc.  Series A common
                  stock,  $1.00 par value per share ("Satellite  Series A Common
                  Stock") in accordance  with the terms of the notes.  Following
                  such conversion,  none of such notes remain outstanding.  Such
                  notes were held by a then director of the Company,  as well as
                  several  members of his family.  In  connection  with the AT&T
                  Merger, such director resigned.  Immediately prior to the AT&T
                  Merger,  the  notes  were  convertible,  at the  option of the
                  holders,  into an aggregate of 24,163,259  shares of TCI Group
                  Series A Stock,  19,416,889  shares of Liberty  Group Series A
                  Stock,  20,711,364 shares of TCI Ventures Group Series A Stock
                  and  3,451,897  shares  of  Satellite  Series A Common  Stock.
                  Pursuant  to the terms of the Merger  Agreement  and a certain
                  stock purchase agreement,  dated as of July 9, 1986, among the
                  Company  and  the  holders  of  such  convertible  notes,  the
                  conversion  feature of the convertible notes was adjusted such
                  that as of the  March 9,  1999  consummation  date of the AT&T
                  Merger,  such  notes were  convertible  into an  aggregate  of
                  28,632,122  shares of AT&T Common Stock,  60,373,632 shares of
                  AT&T  Liberty  Class A Tracking  Stock (as adjusted for a June
                  1999   two-for-one   stock  split)  and  3,451,897  shares  of
                  Satellite Series A Common Stock.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         Certain  debt  instruments  of a  subsidiary  of  the  Company  contain
         restrictive   covenants   which  require,   among  other  things,   the
         maintenance  of certain  earnings,  specified  cash flow and  financial
         ratios  (primarily  the ratios of cash flow to total debt and cash flow
         to debt  service,  as  defined),  and include  certain  limitations  on
         indebtedness,  investments, guarantees, dispositions, stock repurchases
         and/or dividend payments.

         The aggregate fair value  assigned in purchase  accounting to New TCI's
         debt and related  variable and fixed interest rate exchange  agreements
         ("Interest  Rate Swaps")  exceeded the aggregate  recorded value at the
         date of the AT&T Merger by $945 million. Such excess is being amortized
         over the respective remaining 1 to 30 year lives of the underlying debt
         obligations and Interest Rate Swaps. See note 2.

         The fair value of the Company's  debt,  exclusive of the AT&T Notes, is
         estimated  based on the  quoted  market  prices for the same or similar
         issues or on the current  rates  offered to the Company for debt of the
         same  remaining  maturities.  At June 30,  1999,  the fair value of the
         Company's debt,  exclusive of the AT&T Notes,  was $9,584  million,  as
         compared to a carrying value of $9,915 million on such date. Due to its
         related  party  nature,  it is not  practical  to  obtain a  reasonable
         estimate of the fair value of the AT&T Notes.

         In order to achieve the desired balance between variable and fixed rate
         indebtedness,  the Company may enter into Interest Rate Swaps  pursuant
         to which it (i) pays fixed interest rates (the "Fixed Rate Agreements")
         and receives  variable  interest rates and (ii) pays variable  interest
         rates (the  "Variable  Rate  Agreements")  and receives  fixed interest
         rates.  During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  1998,  the  Company's
         payments  pursuant to the Fixed Rate  Agreements  were $1  million.  At
         December 31,  1998,  all of the  Company's  Fixed Rate  Agreements  had
         expired, therefore, no such payments were made in 1999. During the four
         months ended June 30, 1999,  the two months ended February 28, 1999 and
         the six months ended June 30, 1998, the Company's net receipts pursuant
         to the  Variable  Rate  Agreements  were $9 million,  $1 million and $4
         million, respectively.

         Information  concerning the Company's  Variable Rate Agreements at June
         30, 1999 is as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         In addition to the Variable  Rate  Agreements,  the Company has entered
         into  Interest  Rate Swaps  pursuant  to which it pays a variable  rate
         based on LIBOR  (6.1% at June 30,  1999) and  receives a variable  rate
         based on the Constant Maturity Treasury Index ("CMT") (5.9% at June 30,
         1999) on a notional amount of $400 million through  September 2000; and
         pays a  variable  rate  based on LIBOR  (6.0%  at June  30,  1999)  and
         receives  a  variable  rate  based on CMT  (6.0%  at June 30,  1999) on
         notional amounts of $95 million through  February 2000.  During each of
         the four months ended June 30, 1999,  the two months ended February 28,
         1999 and the six months ended June 30, 1998, the Company's net payments
         pursuant to such  agreements  were $1 million.  At June 30,  1999,  the
         Company would be required to pay less than $1 million to terminate such
         Interest Rate Swaps.

         The Company is exposed to credit losses for the periodic settlements of
         amounts   due  under  the   Interest   Rate   Swaps  in  the  event  of
         nonperformance  by the other parties to the  agreements.  However,  the
         Company  does not  anticipate  that it will incur any  material  credit
         losses   because  it  does  not   anticipate   nonperformance   by  the
         counterparties.  Further,  the  Company  does not  anticipate  material
         near-term  losses  in  future  earnings,  fair  values  or  cash  flows
         resulting from derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 1999.

(9)      Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of
         Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely Subordinated Debt Securities
         -------------------------------------------------------------

         The Trust  Preferred  Securities  are presented  together in a separate
         line item in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets  captioned
         "Company-obligated   mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities  of
         subsidiary   trusts  holding  solely   subordinated  debt  securities."
         Dividends  accrued on the Trust  Preferred  Securities  aggregated  $48
         million,  $23 million and $71 million during the four months ended June
         30,  1999,  the two months  ended  February 28, 1999 and the six months
         ended  June  30,  1998,  respectively,  and are  included  in  minority
         interests in earnings of consolidated  subsidiaries in the accompanying
         consolidated financial statements.

         The aggregate fair value assigned to the Trust Preferred  Securities in
         purchase  accounting  exceeded the aggregate recorded value at the date
         of the AT&T Merger by $160 million. Such excess is being amortized over
         the remaining 28 to 46 year terms of such securities.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         General
         -------

         During 1997, Old TCI entered into certain equity swap  facilities.  Due
         to  Old  TCI's  ability  to  issue  shares  to  settle  periodic  price
         fluctuations  and  fees  under  the  equity  swap  facilities,  Old TCI
         recorded  all  amounts  received or paid under  these  arrangements  as
         increases or decreases,  respectively, to equity. From February 1, 1999
         to March 5, 1999, Old TCI terminated all transactions  under the equity
         swap facilities and the related swap agreements. In connection with the
         termination of such  transactions,  the Company received aggregate cash
         payments of $677 million. Such cash payments are reflected in Old TCI's
         consolidated financial statements for the two months ended February 28,
         1999.

         In July 1998, the Company entered into an equity swap  transaction with
         a commercial  bank,  which  provided the Company with the right but not
         the obligation to acquire  1,084,056 shares of TCI Group Series A Stock
         for  approximately  $45 million on or before April 19, 1999. During the
         two months ended February 28, 1999, the Company  acquired the 1,084,056
         shares of TCI Group  Series A Stock  under the  agreement.  Such shares
         were  used to  satisfy  the  exchange  requirements  of a  subsidiary's
         preferred  stock. The $29 million excess of the amount paid for the TCI
         Group  Series A Stock  over the  Company's  minority  interest  in such
         subsidiary has been reflected as a decrease to stockholders'  equity in
         the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements for the two months
         ended February 28, 1999.

 (11)    Transactions with Related Parties
         ---------------------------------

         On July 23,  1998, a merger in which TCG agreed to be acquired by AT&T,
         was consummated.  As a result of such merger,  TCI received in exchange
         for all of its interest in TCG, 70,429,248 shares of AT&T Common Stock.
         TCI recognized a $2.3 billion gain (before  deducting  deferred  income
         tax  expense  of $883  million)  on such  transaction  during the third
         quarter of 1998 based on the difference  between the carrying amount of
         TCI's  interest  in TCG and the fair  value of the  AT&T  Common  Stock
         received. Prior to the AT&T Merger, TCI had accounted for its ownership
         interest in AT&T Common Stock as an available-for-sale  security.  Such
         AT&T Common Stock was transferred  from  Liberty/Ventures  Group to TCI
         Group in  connection  with the AT&T  Merger.  See note 2. In  addition,
         immediately  prior to the  AT&T  Merger,  certain  shares  of  Series F
         Preferred Stock were converted into shares of TCI Group Stock which, in
         turn, were converted into 215,755,850 shares of AT&T Common Stock. Such
         converted  shares are recorded at Old TCI's  historical cost basis. New
         TCI treats its  investment in AT&T Common Stock as an investment in its
         parent.  Accordingly,  New TCI's  investment  in AT&T  Common  Stock is
         reflected  as a  reduction  of  TCI's  equity.  The  Company  does  not
         anticipate  that it will receive  dividends on its  investment  in AT&T
         Common Stock.

         The Company's  non-interest bearing intercompany account with AT&T ($15
         million at June 30, 1999) is included in TCI's  "Investment in AT&T" in
         the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         Certain  entities  attributed  to Liberty  Media Group  produce  and/or
         distribute   programming  to  the  Company.   Charges  to  the  Company
         aggregated  $69 million for the four months ended June 30,  1999.  Such
         amount is included in operating costs and expenses in the  accompanying
         consolidated statements of operations.

         AT&T  provides  long  distance  service  and  allocates  certain  other
         administrative costs to the Company.  During the four months ended June
         30,  1999,  such  amounts  aggregated  $17 million and are  included in
         selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  accompanying
         consolidated statements of operations.

         NDTC leases  transponder  facilities to entities  attributed to Liberty
         Media Group. Charges by NDTC for such arrangements were $10 million for
         the four months  ended June 30, 1999 and are included in revenue in the
         accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

(12)     Transactions with Officers and Directors
         ----------------------------------------

         After the Company's stockholders voted to approve the terms of the AT&T
         Merger,  on February  17, 1999,  TCI's Board of Directors  approved the
         payment  by  Liberty/Ventures  Group  of $1  million  to  each  of  two
         directors of the Company for their services on the Special Committee of
         TCI's  Board  of  Directors  in  evaluating  the  AT&T  Merger  and the
         consideration  to be received by the  stockholders  of the Company.  In
         addition,  Liberty/Ventures  Group paid $10  million to a director  and
         executive officer of TCI, immediately prior to the AT&T Merger, for his
         services in  negotiating  the merger  agreement and completing the AT&T
         Merger.

         Prior to the AT&T  Merger,  a limited  liability  company  owned by Dr.
         Malone,  TCI's Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  acquired,  from
         certain  subsidiaries  of Old TCI,  working cattle  ranches  located in
         Wyoming in exchange for a $17 million promissory note from such limited
         liability company.  No gain or loss was recognized on such acquisition.
         Upon payment of such note, the excess of the proceeds received over the
         carrying  value of the cattle  ranches will be reflected as an increase
         to additional paid-in-capital.  The purchase price paid by such limited
         liability  company was in the form of a 12-month  note in the amount of
         $17 million  having an interest  rate of 7%. Such note is payable to an
         entity  attributed to Liberty  Media Group at any time without  penalty
         and is personally guaranteed by Dr. Malone.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         As  described  more fully in note 7, the Company  has  entered  into an
         agreement wherein TCI will acquire all of the partnership  interests in
         InterMedia IV and InterMedia Partners.  An individual who is a director
         and executive  officer of TCI,  currently  has a .001% special  limited
         partnership  interest  in ICM IV,  which  in turn  has a 1.19%  limited
         partnership  interest  in  InterMedia  IV.  Such  individual's  special
         limited  partnership  interest  in ICM IV was created in August 1997 in
         connection with TCI's  acquisition of all of the partnership  interests
         (other than a .002%  general  partnership  interest and a .001% special
         limited   partnership   interest)  in  ICM  IV.  Such  individual  also
         indirectly  owns  a  minimal  interest  in  InterMedia   Partners.   In
         connection  with the  proposed  transaction  described in note 7, it is
         anticipated  that such  individual,  by  virtue  of his  .001%  special
         limited  partnership  interest in ICM IV, will  participate in a profit
         sharing mechanism of InterMedia IV and receive cash consideration based
         on the valuation of InterMedia IV in the transaction  described in note
         7. Although the amount of such consideration is uncertain at this time,
         its is  expected  that such  consideration  will be  approximately  $10
         million.  In the transaction  described above, it is expected that such
         individual will receive less than $50,000 for his indirect  interest in
         InterMedia Partners.

         For  additional  transactions  involving  the  Company's  officers  and
         directors, see notes 8 and 13.

 (13)    Commitments and Contingencies
         -----------------------------

         The Cable  Television  Consumer  Protection and Competition Act of 1992
         (the "1992 Cable Act") imposed  certain rate  regulations  on the cable
         television  industry.  Under the 1992 Cable Act, all cable  systems are
         subject to rate regulation,  unless they face "effective  competition,"
         as defined by the 1992 Cable Act and expanded in the Telecommunications
         act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), in their local franchise area.

         Although  the  Federal   Communications   Commission  (the  "FCC")  has
         established   regulations   required  by  the  1992  Cable  Act,  local
         government   units   (commonly   referred   to  as  local   franchising
         authorities) are primarily responsible for administering the regulation
         of a cable system's basic service tier ("BST"). The FCC itself directly
         administered  rate  regulation  of any cable  programming  service tier
         ("CPST").  The FCC's  authority to regulate CPST rates expired on March
         31, 1999. The FCC has taken the position that it will still  adjudicate
         CPST  complaints  filed  after this  sunset date (but no later than 180
         days  after  the last  CPST rate  increase  imposed  prior to March 31,
         1999),  and will strictly limit its review (and possible refund orders)
         to the time period predating the sunset date.

         Under the FCC's rate  regulations,  most cable systems were required to
         reduce  their BST and CPST  rates in 1993 and 1994,  and have since had
         their rate  increases  governed by a complicated  price  structure that
         allows for the recovery of inflation and certain  increased  costs,  as
         well as  providing  some  incentive  for  expanding  channel  carriage.
         Operators  also  have  the  opportunity  to  bypass  this   "benchmark"
         regulatory  structure  in  favor of the  traditional  "cost-of-service"
         regulation  in cases where the latter  methodology  appears  favorable.
         Premium cable services  offered on a per-channel  or per-program  basis
         remain  unregulated,  as do affirmatively  marketed packages consisting
         entirely of new programming product.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         The Company believes that it has complied in all material respects with
         the  provisions  of the 1992 Cable Act and the 1996 Act,  including its
         rate  setting  provisions.  If, as a result of the  review  process,  a
         system  cannot   substantiate  its  rates,  it  could  be  required  to
         retroactively reduce its rates to the appropriate  benchmark and refund
         the excess portion of rates received. Any refunds of the excess portion
         of CPST  rates  would  be  retroactive  to the date of  complaint.  Any
         refunds  of the  excess  portion  of BST or  equipment  rates  would be
         retroactive  to one  year  prior  to  the  implementation  of the  rate
         reductions.

         The Company is obligated  and/or has  guaranteed  Liberty Media Group's
         obligation to pay fees for the rights to exhibit certain films that are
         released  by  various  producers  through  2017  (the  "Film  Licensing
         Obligations").  Based  on  customer  levels  at June  30,  1999,  these
         agreements  require minimum  payments  aggregating  approximately  $317
         million.  The aggregate amount of the Film Licensing  Obligations under
         these license agreements is not currently estimable because such amount
         is dependent upon the number of qualifying films released  theatrically
         by certain  motion picture  studios as well as the domestic  theatrical
         exhibition   receipts  upon  the  release  of  such  qualifying  films.
         Nevertheless,  required  aggregate  payments  under the Film  Licensing
         Obligations could prove to be significant.

         The  Company  is a party to  affiliation  agreements  with  programming
         suppliers.  Pursuant  to certain  of such  agreements,  the  Company is
         committed to carry such  suppliers'  programming  on its cable systems.
         Additionally,  certain of such  agreements  provide for  penalties  and
         charges in the event the programming is not carried or not delivered to
         a contractually specified number of customers.

         The Company is  committed  to purchase  billing  services  from a third
         party pursuant to three successive  five-year  agreements.  Pursuant to
         such  arrangement,  the Company is  obligated  at June 30, 1999 to make
         minimum payments  aggregating  approximately $1.5 billion through 2012.
         Such minimum  payments are subject to inflation  and other  adjustments
         pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreements.

         The Company has  guaranteed  notes  payable  and other  obligations  of
         affiliated   and  other   companies   with   outstanding   balances  of
         approximately $77 million at June 30, 1999. The Company also has agreed
         to take  certain  steps to  support  debt  compliance  with  respect to
         obligations  aggregating  $1,690  million of certain  cable  television
         partnerships  in  which  the  Company  has  non-controlling   ownership
         interests.  See note 7. The Company also has guaranteed the performance
         of certain  affiliates  and other parties with respect to such parties'
         contractual and other obligations.  Although there can be no assurance,
         management of the Company believes that it will not be required to meet
         its obligations under such guarantees, or if it is required to meet any
         of such obligations, that they will not be material to the Company.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         During 1999, a subsidiary  of the Company  entered into a  contribution
         agreement  ("Contribution  Agreement")  with  certain  shareholders  of
         Phoenixstar,  Inc. (formerly Primestar,  Inc.) ("Phoenixstar") pursuant
         to which  the  Company  would,  to the  extent it is  relieved  of $166
         million of contingent  liabilities  currently owed to certain creditors
         of Phoenixstar and its  subsidiaries,  contribute up to $166 million to
         Phoenixstar  to  the  extent   necessary  to  satisfy   liabilities  of
         Phoenixstar.  During the second  quarter of 1999 and the fourth quarter
         of 1998, the Company  recorded  charges of $50 million and $90 million,
         respectively, to provide for the estimated losses that were expected to
         result from the  Contribution  Agreement.  During the second quarter of
         1999, the Company contributed approximately $114 million to Phoenixstar
         in partial  satisfaction  of its  obligation.  The Company's  remaining
         obligation  under the  Contribution  Agreement  will expire in 2001. An
         individual  who is a director of TCI is also the  Chairman of the Board
         of TCI Satellite Entertainment,  Inc. ("TSAT"). TSAT has an approximate
         37% ownership interest in Phoenixstar.

         TCI has agreed to make fixed monthly  payments to an entity  attributed
         to Liberty Media Group pursuant to an affiliation agreement.  The fixed
         annual commitments  increase annually from $190 million in 1999 to $267
         million in 2003,  and will  increase  with  inflation  through 2022. In
         addition,  TCI is obligated to make minimum  revenue  payments  through
         2017 and minimum  license fee payments  through 2007  aggregating  $392
         million to an entity  attributed to Liberty  Media Group.  Such minimum
         payments are subject to inflation and other adjustments pursuant to the
         terms of the underlying agreements.

         Effective as of December  16,  1997,  NDTC on behalf of the Company and
         other cable  operators that may be designated from time to time by NDTC
         ("Approved  Purchasers"),  entered  into  an  agreement  (the  "Digital
         Terminal  Purchase  Agreement")  with GI to purchase  advanced  digital
         set-top  devices.  The hardware and  software  incorporated  into these
         devices  are   designed  and   manufactured   to  be   compatible   and
         interoperable  with  the  OpenCable(TM)   architecture   specifications
         adopted by  CableLabs,  the cable  television  industry's  research and
         development consortium, in November 1997. NDTC has agreed that Approved
         Purchasers  will purchase,  in the aggregate,  a minimum of 6.5 million
         set-top devices during calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000 at an average
         price of $318 per set-top device.  The 1998 purchase  commitment of 1.5
         million  set-top  devices was met. During the six months ended June 30,
         1999,  approximately 930,000 set-top devices had been purchased related
         to the 1999 commitment of 1,750,000 devices.  GI agreed to provide NDTC
         and its  Approved  Purchasers  the most  favorable  prices,  terms  and
         conditions  made  available by GI to any customer  purchasing  advanced
         digital set-top devices. In connection with NDTC's purchase commitment,
         GI agreed to grant  warrants to purchase its common stock  proportional
         to the number of devices  ordered by each  organization.  In connection
         with   the   AT&T   Merger,   such   warrants   were   transferred   to
         Liberty/Ventures  Group in exchange for  approximately  $176 million in
         cash. To the extent such warrants do not vest because TCI fails to meet
         its  purchase  commitments,  TCI is  required  to repay a  proportional
         amount  of such  cash to  Liberty  Media  Group.  NDTC has the right to
         terminate  the Digital  Terminal  Purchase  Agreement  if,  among other
         reasons,  GI  fails  to meet a  material  milestone  designated  in the
         Digital  Terminal  Purchase  Agreement with respect to the development,
         testing and delivery of advanced digital set-top devices.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         On July 17, 1998,  the Company  acquired 21.4 million  shares of common
         stock of GI in exchange for (i) certain of the assets of NDTC's set-top
         authorization business, (ii) the license of certain related software to
         GI,  (iii) a $50  million  promissory  note from the Company to GI, and
         (iv) a nine-year  revenue guarantee from the Company in favor of GI. In
         connection  therewith,  NDTC also  entered  into a  services  agreement
         pursuant to which it will provide certain postcontract services to GI's
         set-top  authorization  business.  The 21.4 million shares of GI common
         stock are, in addition to other transfer restrictions, restricted as to
         their sale by NDTC for a three-year  period.  The Company  recorded its
         investment  in such  shares at fair  value  which  included  a discount
         attributable to the above-described liquidity restriction.  As a result
         of the  deconsolidation of Liberty Media Group, the 21.4 million shares
         of GI common stock are no longer included in the Company's consolidated
         assets.  The $346  million  excess of the fair value of GI common stock
         received in 1998 over (i) the book value of certain assets  transferred
         from  NDTC  to GI,  and  (ii)  the $42  million  present  value  of the
         promissory  note  due from  the  Company  to GI,  was  deferred  by the
         Company.  A portion of such excess  equal to the $160  million  present
         value of the annual amounts specified by the revenue guarantee is being
         amortized  to revenue  over nine  years in  proportion  to such  annual
         guaranteed  amounts.   The  remaining  $186  million  excess  is  being
         amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the nine-year period
         that NDTC is required to perform postcontract services.

         The Company has contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings and
         other matters arising in the ordinary  course of business.  Although it
         is reasonably  possible the Company may incur losses upon conclusion of
         such matters,  an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made.
         In the opinion of  management,  it is expected  that  amounts,  if any,
         which  may be  required  to  satisfy  such  contingencies  will  not be
         material  in  relation  to  the  accompanying   consolidated  financial
         statements.

(14)     Year 2000
         ---------

         During the six months ended June 30, 1999,  the Company  continued  its
         enterprise-wide,  comprehensive  efforts  to assess and  remediate  its
         computer  systems and related  software  and  equipment  to ensure such
         systems,   software  and   equipment   recognize,   process  and  store
         information  in the year 2000 and  thereafter.  The Company's year 2000
         remediation efforts include an assessment of its most critical systems,
         such as customer service and billing systems,  headends and other cable
         plant systems that support the Company's programming services, business
         support  operations,  and other equipment and  facilities.  The Company
         also  continued  its efforts to verify the year 2000  readiness  of its
         significant  suppliers  and vendors and continued to  communicate  with
         significant  business  partners and  affiliates to assess such partners
         and affiliates' year 2000 status.

         The Company has a year 2000  Program  Management  Office (the "PMO") to
         organize  and  manage  its year 2000  remediation  efforts.  The PMO is
         responsible for overseeing, coordinating and reporting on the Company's
         year 2000 remediation  efforts. At June 30, 1999, it was comprised of a
         340-member, full-time staff, accountable to executive management of the
         Company.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


         During the six months ended June 30, 1999,  the Company  continued  its
         survey of significant  third-party vendors and suppliers whose systems,
         services or products are  important to the  Company's  operations.  The
         year 2000  readiness  of such  vendors  and  suppliers  is  critical to
         continued  provision of the Company's  cable  service.  The Company has
         examined the public  disclosures  regarding  compliance  status made by
         vendors of critical systems  products  utilized by the Company (such as
         addressable controllers, accounting systems and other critical hardware
         and  software),  and the  Company is in the  process of  examining  the
         public  disclosures   regarding  compliance  status  made  by  critical
         suppliers (such as utilities, banking, and similar critical operational
         services).  Verification  of the survey results may include,  as deemed
         necessary, conducting functionality tests, reviewing vendors' test data
         certifications, engaging in regular conferences with vendors' year 2000
         teams, or re-examining  public  disclosures for changes in status.  For
         those  vendors and suppliers who do not expect to be year 2000 ready by
         December  31,  1999,  or are  deemed to be  critical  to the  Company's
         operations,  contingency  planning  efforts  are  underway to make such
         changes as are required to continue critical operations.

         Significant  market value is associated with the Company's  investments
         in certain  public and  private  corporations,  partnerships  and other
         businesses.   Accordingly,   the  Company  is  monitoring   the  public
         disclosure of such publicly-held  business entities,  including CSC and
         @Home, to determine their year 2000 readiness. In addition, the Company
         has   surveyed   and   monitored   the  year  2000  status  of  certain
         privately-held  business  entities in which the Company has significant
         investments.

         Year 2000 expenses and capital  expenditures  incurred  during the four
         months   ended  June  30,  1999  were  $31  million  and  $10  million,
         respectively.  Year 2000  expenses  and capital  expenditures  incurred
         during the two months  ended  February 28, 1999 were $11 million and $2
         million, respectively.  Year 2000 expenses and capital expenditures for
         the four months ended June 30, 1999 are exclusive of costs attributable
         to Liberty Media Group,  which was  deconsolidated as of March 1, 1999.
         See note 2. Management of the Company currently estimates the remaining
         costs,  exclusive of future costs  attributable  to the  assessment and
         remediation of year 2000 issues associated with Liberty Media Group, to
         be not  less  than $69  million,  bringing  the  total  estimated  cost
         associated with the Company's year 2000  remediation  efforts to be not
         less than $136  million  (including  $32  million  for  replacement  of
         noncompliant  information  technology  systems).  Also included in this
         estimate  is $13  million in future  payments  to be made  pursuant  to
         unfulfilled  executory  contracts or commitments  with vendors for year
         2000 remediation services.

         The failure to correct a material  year 2000 problem could result in an
         interruption or failure of certain important business operations. There
         can be no assurance that the Company's  systems or the systems of other
         companies on which the Company relies will be converted in time or that
         any such failure to convert by the Company or other  companies will not
         have a material  adverse effect on its financial  position,  results of
         operations or cash flows.

(15)     Information about the Company's Operating Segments
         --------------------------------------------------

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, Old TCI had two reportable segments: domestic
         cable and communications  services and domestic  programming  services.
         Domestic cable and  communications  services  receive video,  audio and
         data signals  from  various  sources,  and amplify and  distribute  the
         signals by coaxial cable and optical fiber to the premises of customers
         who  pay a fee for  the  service.  Domestic  programming  services  are
         produced, acquired, and distributed,  through all available formats and
         media,   branded   entertainment  and  informational   programming  and
         software,  including multimedia products,  delivered in both analog and
         digital form.  Old TCI's  domestic  cable and  communications  services
         business and assets were included in TCI Group,  and Old TCI's domestic
         programming business and assets were included in Old Liberty Group. Old
         TCI's  principal  international  businesses  and  assets  and Old TCI's
         remaining non-cable and non-programming  domestic businesses and assets
         were included in TCI Ventures Group.

         As described in note 2, immediately  prior to the AT&T Merger,  Old TCI
         purchased certain assets from Liberty/Ventures Group and the net assets
         attributed to Liberty Media Group were  deconsolidated.  As a result of
         these transactions,  domestic cable and communications  services is the
         only reportable segment of New TCI.

         The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
         in  the  summary  of  significant   accounting  policies.  The  Company
         evaluates  performance  based on a  measure  of  Operating  Cash  Flow.
         Operating Cash Flow is a measure of value and borrowing capacity within
         the cable  television  industry  and is not intended to be a substitute
         for cash  flow  provided  by  operating  activities,  or a  measure  of
         performance  prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
         principles, and should not be relied upon as such.

         In  addition,  New TCI's  performance  is  evaluated  by AT&T  based on
         several factors,  of which the primary  financial  measure is earnings,
         including  other income,  before  interest  expense and taxes ("EBIT").
         Segment  EBIT  data  and  segment  depreciation  and  amortization  are
         provided  supplementally  herein  along  with  the  Company's  standard
         measure of Operating Cash Flow.  The Company's  calculation of EBIT may
         or may not be consistent  with the  calculation of EBIT by other public
         companies, and EBIT should not be viewed as an alternative to generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  measures  of income,  as a measure of
         performance,  or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing
         activities as a measure of liquidity.

         The Company generally  accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as
         if the sales or transfers  were to third  parties,  that is, at current
         market prices.

         Old TCI's  reportable  segments  were  strategic  business  units  that
         offered different  products and services.  They were managed separately
         because  each  segment  required  different  technology  and  marketing
         strategies.

         The  unaudited  pro forma  information  set forth below  for AT&T Corp.
(AT&T)  gives  effect to the merger with  Tele-Communications,  Inc.  (TCI) (the
Merger) and certain  merger-related asset transfers from TCI Liberty Media Group
and TCI Ventures Group (Liberty/Ventures Group) as if they had been completed on
January 1, 1998,  subject to the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying
notes to the pro forma financial information.

         Following  the Merger,  the new  Liberty Media Group (Liberty) tracking
stock  continues to represent an interest in the same assets and  businesses  as
Liberty/Ventures  Group  tracking  stocks did prior to the Merger  (after giving
effect to the asset transfers). Pursuant to certain agreements, Liberty is being
managed  separately from the AT&T Common Stock Group.  Under Delaware  corporate
law,  the Liberty  Board has  virtually  all of Liberty's  corporate  governance
powers and the Class B and C directors on the Liberty Board (who were  designees
of TCI prior to the merger)  constitute  a majority of the Liberty  Board.  AT&T
designated one third of the directors and its rights as the sole  shareholder of
the common stock of Liberty  following  the Merger are limited to actions  which
will require shareholder approval.  Those actions are limited to (a) approval of
a merger or sale of all or  substantially  all of the  assets of  Liberty  Media
Corporation (b) a liquidation of the Liberty Media  Corporation (c) amendment of
Liberty Media  Corporation's  certificate of incorporation,  and (d) election of
directors. Furthermore, AT&T does not have the ability to remove the Class B and
C directors (or their  designees) or have an  opportunity to elect a majority of
the  Liberty  Board until  2006,  at which time  election by AT&T to the Liberty
Board of persons other than those designated by the then Class B and C directors
will constitute a "Triggering  Event" which will result in all of the assets and
businesses of Liberty  being  transferred  into an entity  controlled by persons
other than AT&T unless the  "Triggering  Event" is waived by Liberty  Management
LLC.  Therefore,  management has concluded that AT&T does not have a controlling
financial  interest (as that term is used in  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 94) in Liberty,  and  therefore  accounts for its  investment  in
Liberty under the equity  method.  In addition,  as a tracking  stock all of its
earnings or losses are excluded  from the  earnings  available to the holders of
AT&T common  stock.  The AT&T  common  stock group  represents  historical  AT&T
together with TCI's  domestic  cable and  telecommunications  operations,  TCI's
interest  in At  Home  Corporation  (Excite  @Home),  as well  as  other  assets
transferred in the merger.

         This pro forma  financial  information  should be  read in  conjunction
with the  historical  financial  statements  of AT&T and  TCI.  Historical  AT&T
financial  statements can be found in the Company's annual report on form 10-K/A
as amended March 23, 1999 and July 12, 1999. TCI historical financial statements
can be found in TCI's form 10-K filed on March 15, 1999.

         The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies and
cost savings that may be achievable with respect to the combined companies. The
pro forma adjustments do not include any adjustments to historical sales for any
future price changes nor any adjustments to selling and marketing expenses for
any future operating changes.

         The following information is not necessarily indicative of the
financial position or operating results that would have occurred had the Merger
and the asset transfers been consummated on January 1, 1998. The pro forma
adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Merger are based upon the
purchase method of accounting and upon the assumptions set forth in the notes
hereto, including the exchange of all the outstanding shares of TCI Group
tracking stock for an aggregate of approximately 664 million shares of AT&T
Common Stock.

<PAGE>

         AT&T undertook a study to determine  the fair value of certain of TCI's
assets  and  liabilities  (as so  adjusted)  and has made  appropriate  purchase
accounting  adjustments.  A final allocation will be made upon completion of the
appraisal  process.  We do not believe the final purchase price  allocation will
differ materially from what has been reflected herein.

Notes to Unaudited AT&T Pro Forma Financial Statements (in millions, except per
share amounts)

1.       These columns represent historical results of operations.

2.       This   column represents  deconsolidation   to  the  equity   method of
         accounting  of the  historical  results  of  operations  and  financial
         position for the interests  represented  by the shares of Liberty Media
         Group Tracking Stock that were issued in the Merger.  AT&T accounts for
         Liberty Media Group under the equity method because it does not possess
         a  "controlling  financial  interest"  in  Liberty  Media  Group.  Such
         deconsolidated  interests exclude those interests included in the asset
         transfers.   These  columns  also  reflect  adjustments  to  intergroup
         eliminations as a result of certain merger-related asset transfers.  In
         addition,  the  Liberty/Ventures  Group  and  the TCI  Group  exchanged
         certain other assets.  These other asset  exchanges are  immaterial and
         are not reflected in this  unaudited pro forma  condensed  statement of
         income.  Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock  reflects  the  separate
         performance of the  businesses  and assets  attributed to Liberty Media
         Group subsequent to the Merger.

3.       This  entry represents the amortization of goodwill resulting from  the
         allocation  of the excess of  consideration  over the net assets of the
         TCI Group and the assets acquired by AT&T in the asset  transfers,  net
         of TCI's historical franchise amortization. The excess of the aggregate
         purchase  price of  $52.155  billion  over the fair value of net assets
         acquired, based on this allocation,  was approximately $24 billion, and
         is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven to 40 years. The
         amortization  period  of  intangible  assets,  including  the  goodwill
         amortized over 40 years,  is based upon the expected useful life of the
         franchise  agreements  and value related to the access to homes passed.
         In addition,  approximately  $11 billion of goodwill related to Liberty
         was  recorded as part of our  investment  and is being  amortized  on a
         straight-line  basis over 20 years as a  component  of equity  earnings
         (losses)  from  Liberty.  The factors  considered  in  determining  the
         appropriate  amortization  period  included  the  expected  life of the
         associated technology, legal and regulatory considerations,  experience
         with renewing franchises and territories, future changes in technology,
         anticipated  market  demand  and  competition.  $9.0  billion  has been
         allocated  to TCI's equity  investments.  Such  consideration  is being
         amortized over lives ranging from 25 to 40 years.  Amounts allocated to
         other  identifiable  intangibles were not material.  AT&T will evaluate
         the periods of  amortization  continually  to determine  whether  later
         events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.

4.       Represents purchase accounting adjustments for Liberty.

5.       These entries represent the recognition of incremental interest expense
         on additional borrowing of $9.5 billion  to fund TCI Group's payment to
<PAGE>
         Liberty  Media  Group in  connection  with the asset  transfers  and $4
         billion of AT&T Common  Stock to be  repurchased  by AT&T under a Board
         approved share repurchase  program.  (The share repurchase  program was
         completed  in March  1999.) A  borrowing  mix of 20% short term and 80%
         long  term  was  assumed.  Interest  expense  was  calculated  using an
         interest rate of 5.96% based on AT&T's incremental borrowing rate.

6.       Represents certain  non-recurring  gains with  respect to  the Liberty/
         Ventures Group's investments in Excite@Home and Teleport Communications
         Group Inc.

7.       These  adjustments represent the statutory  tax effect of the pro forma
         adjustments.

8.       Gives effect to the elimination of dividend requirements on certain TCI
         Group preferred stock that was converted at the time of the Merger.

9.       Liberty  tracking stock split on  a two-for-one  basis, payable on June
         11, 1999. The outstanding  common shares and earnings per share amounts
         in this pro forma income  statement are on a pre-split basis. Pro forma
         basic and  diluted  earnings  per  Liberty  common  share,  adjusted to
         reflect the stock  split  would be $(0.10) for the year ended  December
         31, 1998.
