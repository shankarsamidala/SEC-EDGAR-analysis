ITEM 1. BUSINESS


GENERAL


     Sunbeam Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company" or
"Sunbeam") is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer
products. The Company's primary business is the manufacture, marketing and
distribution of durable household consumer products through mass market and
other distributors in the United States and internationally. The Company also
sells its products to commercial end users such as hotels and other
institutions (the "Away From Home" category of the business).


     The Company's product categories are: (1) Appliances (mixers, blenders,
food steamers, bread makers, rice cookers, coffee makers, toasters, irons and
garment steamers) (2) Health at Home (vaporizers, humidifiers, air cleaners,
water filters, massagers, hot and cold packs, blood pressure monitors and
scales) (3) Personal Care and Comfort (shower massagers, hair clippers and
trimmers, electric warming blankets and throws) (4) Outdoor Cooking (electric,
gas and charcoal grills and grill accessories) and (5) Away From Home (clippers
and related products for the professional beauty, barber and veterinarian trade
and sales of products to commercial and institutional channels). The
International Group is responsible for sales (primarily of small appliances,
personal care, grills and comfort products, professional clippers and related
products) in all countries other than the United States.


     Sunbeam products enjoy a long-standing reputation for quality, and a
majority of the Company's sales are from products which hold the number one or
two market share in their respective product categories.


     The Company was organized in 1989 (as Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc.) and in
September 1990, Sunbeam acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities,
through a reorganization, of Allegheny International, Inc. (the "Predecessor"),
an entity operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code since 1988. In August 1992, the Company completed a
public offering of 20,000,000 shares of its common stock. In May 1995, the
Company changed its name from Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. to Sunbeam
Corporation.


RESTRUCTURING AND GROWTH PLAN


     In the Fall of 1996, under newly elected Chairman, Albert J. Dunlap, the
Company announced a major restructuring and growth plan. The restructuring
portion of the plan was completed during 1997, resulting in a significant
reduction in employees, facilities and costs, all of which is anticipated to
generate approximately $225 million in annual savings for the Company. As a
part of the restructuring plan, the Company divested its non-core businesses
and assets, including furniture, time and temperature, decorative bedding, gas
heaters and logs, Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered
trademark/ scale businesses and the Company's Biddeford, Maine textile mill.


     The Company's restructuring plan included the closure of 18 factories, 43
warehouses and 5 headquarters, resulting in the consolidation of all corporate
offices into a single headquarters office located in Delray Beach, Florida and
an operations center at its Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution
facility. The number of manufacturing facilities has been reduced from
twenty-six to eight (four in the US and four international). See "Properties"
below.


     The Company has also consolidated all purchasing functions, substantially
reduced the number of stock keeping units maintained by the Company and
outsourced certain administrative, manufacturing and distribution activities.


     The Company has developed a comprehensive three year growth plan for its
core businesses. Sunbeam's goal is for revenues to double, reaching $2 billion
by 1999, with operating margins improving


                                       1
<PAGE>

to 20% of sales. This revenue growth is anticipated to be derived, in large
part, by the development of new innovative products and the globalization of the
Company. Domestically, the goal is to introduce at least 30 new products each
year; during 1997, the Company introduced 35 new domestic products and 54 new
international products. In its international business, the Company has a goal to
triple international sales to $600 million by 1999. During 1997 the Company
entered into 25 new international distribution/license agreements. The Company
has also identified new channels of distribution as additional sales growth
opportunities, including commercial organizations and "direct to the consumer"
channels such as catalogs, the Internet and Sunbeam/registered trademark/
factory outlet stores. These growth plans do not reflect the impact of the
Company's pending acquisitions of The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands
USA, Inc. and First Alert, Inc. See "PENDING ACQUISITIONS".


     Both international expansion and new product introductions will be
supported by a significant investment in a major new advertising program that is
geared to continually strengthening the Sunbeam/registered trademark/,
Oster/registered trademark/, Grillmaster/registered trademark/ and other brands
in the marketplace.


PENDING ACQUISITIONS


     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced that it had entered into three
separate agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA,
Inc. and First Alert, Inc. The three transactions are subject to customary
conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, and are
expected to close early this spring.


     The Coleman Company, Inc. ("Coleman"), with 1997 revenues of approximately
$1.1 billion, is the world's leading manufacturer and marketer of outdoor
recreational products. It manufactures and distributes widely diversified
product lines for camping, leisure time and hardware markets, under the
Coleman/registered trademark/, Powermate/registered trademark/, Camping
Gaz/registered trademark/ and Eastpak/registered trademark/ brand names. The
Coleman transaction is valued at approximately $2.0 billion, consisting of
approximately $811 million in Company common stock, approximately $260 million
in cash and the assumption of debt.


     Signature Brands USA, Inc. ("Signature Brands"), with 1997 revenues of
approximately $279 million, is a leading manufacturer of a comprehensive line of
consumer and professional products, including coffee makers marketed under the
Mr. Coffee/registered trademark/ brand name and consumer health products
marketed under the Health-o-Meter/registered trademark/, Counselor/registered
trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ brand names. The Signature Brands
transaction is valued at approximately $250 million, consisting of cash and the
assumption of debt.


     First Alert, Inc. ("First Alert"), with revenues of approximately $187
million, is the worldwide leader in residential safety equipment including smoke
and carbon monoxide detectors marketed under the First Alert/registered
trademark/ brand name. The First Alert transaction is valued at approximately
$175 million, consisting of cash and the assumption of debt.


     In connection with the three transactions, the Company intends to seek to
negotiate a new bank credit facility and to issue other debt securities. See
"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources."


PRODUCTS


     The Company's core product categories are as follows:


APPLIANCES


     Small kitchen appliances including Mixmaster/registered trademark/ stand
mixers, hand mixers, Osterizer/registered trademark/ blenders, food processors,
rice cookers, food steamers, toasters, can openers, coffee makers, bread
makers, waffle makers, ice cream makers, frying pans, deep fryers and culinary
accessories, are sold primarily under the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and
Oster/registered trademark/ brand names. The Company holds the number one or
two market positions in blenders, mixers, and bread makers. The Appliance
category also encompasses garment care appliances consisting of irons and
steamers. Sales of appliances accounted for approximately 32% of the Company's
domestic net sales in 1997.

                                       2
<PAGE>

HEALTH AT HOME


     The Company markets its home health products under the Sunbeam/registered
trademark/ name and the trademark Health at Home/registered trademark/. These
products include heating pads, bath scales, blood pressure and other health-
monitoring instruments, massagers, vaporizers, humidifiers and dental care
products. This product category also includes the recently introduced
AllergySmart/trademark/ air detector and air cleaner and the
FreshSource/trademark/ power water filter. Sales of health care products
accounted for approximately 10% of the Company's domestic net sales in 1997.


PERSONAL CARE AND COMFORT


     The Company's personal care and comfort products include a broad line of
electric blankets, comforters and Cuddle-Up/registered trademark/ heated
throws, shower massagers, and hair clippers and trimmers for animals and humans
which are sold through retail channels. The Company holds the number one market
position in electric blankets, heated throws and retail hair clippers. Sales of
personal care and comfort products accounted for approximately 18% of the
Company's domestic net sales in 1997.


OUTDOOR COOKING


     Sunbeam is a leading supplier of outdoor barbecue grills. Sunbeam has the
leading market share position in the gas grill industry. Barbecue grills
consist of propane, natural gas, electric and charcoal models sold primarily
under the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and Grillmaster/registered trademark/
brand names. Sales of outdoor cooking products accounted for approximately 34%
of the Company's domestic net sales in 1997.


AWAY FROM HOME


     The Company markets a line of professional barber, beauty and animal
equipment, including electric and battery clippers, replacement blades and
other grooming accessories sold to both


                                       3
<PAGE>

conventional retailers and through professional distributors. In addition, the
Company is expanding the marketing of its appliances, scales and personal care
and comfort products to institutional and commercial channels. Sales of away
from home products accounted for approximately 6% of the
Company's domestic net sales in 1997.


INTERNATIONAL


     The Company markets a variety of products (primarily small kitchen
appliances, personal care and comfort products, grills, professional clippers
and related products ) outside the U.S. While the Company sells many of the
same products domestically and internationally, it also sells products designed
specifically to appeal to foreign markets. The Company, through its foreign
subsidiaries, has manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Venezuela, and sales
offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company's
international products are sourced from the Company's United States, Mexican or
Venezuelan manufacturing operations or from vendors primarily located in Asia.
International sales accounted for approximately 21% of the Company's total net
sales in 1997.


     To date, the Company's activities outside the United States have been
primarily focused in Mexico, Latin America and Canada. The Company enjoys a
strong market position in a number of product categories in Latin America. The
Oster/registered trademark/ brand has the leading market share in small
appliances in a number of Latin American countries.

     The Company's pending acquisitions of Coleman, Signature Brands and First
Alert are anticipated to provide new opportunities for international expansion
of the Company's activities. See "Pending Acquisitions".

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS


     Worldwide, Sunbeam competes in markets with a number of well-established
United States and foreign companies on the basis of various strengths,
depending on the country, product category and distribution channels. The
Company believes that it is well-positioned to pursue continued growth as a
result of several competitive strengths, which include the following:


     DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. The Company has one of the premier mass merchant
distribution networks serving large national retailers in the United States.
The Company also has a strong network of well-established distributors and
service organizations in Latin America. The Company supports its customers
needs with strong warehousing and distribution capabilities, a broad,
high-quality product portfolio, electronic data interchange ("EDI") and
just-in-time product delivery capabilities. The Company markets its products
through virtually every category of retailer including mass merchandisers,
catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs, department stores, catalogues,
Company-owned outlet stores, television shopping channels, hardware stores,
home improvement centers, drug and grocery stores, and pet supply retailers, as
well as independent distributors and military post exchange outlets.


     STRONG POSITION IN CONSOLIDATING RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. The consolidation
trend in the retail industry has resulted in the emergence and global expansion
of large mass merchandisers that demand financially strong, efficient suppliers
which offer a broad range of innovative, quality products with the ability to
make timely shipments in large volumes and provide strong customer, promotional
and merchandising support. The Company has benefited from this trend and
believes it has the opportunity to further expand distribution with a number of
retailers and increase its penetration of existing


                                       4
<PAGE>

accounts. In 1997, the Company sold products to virtually all of the top 100
U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, Price Costco, Kmart, Target Stores, Home
Depot, Sears, Roebuck & Co., Service Merchandise, Menards, Lowe's and J.C.
Penney.


     BRAND NAME RECOGNITION. The Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and
Oster/registered trademark/ brands have been household names for generations.
The Company believes that these brands, along with its other well-known
secondary names such as Mixmaster/registered trademark/ and
Osterizer/registered trademark/ draw customers into retail stores specifically
to purchase products bearing these brand names. During the past year, the
Company has spent over $56 million for advertising and sales promotion to
support brand recognition.


     MARKET LEADERSHIP. The majority of Sunbeam sales are from products in
which the Company holds the number one or two market share position. The
Company believes that this combination of leading brand-name products and
breadth of product offerings makes Sunbeam an attractive vendor to retailers
who are consolidating their suppliers.


CUSTOMERS


     The rapid growth of large mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs and
changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant
consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the formation of dominant
multi-category retailers. Sunbeam has positioned itself to respond to the
challenges of this changing retail environment by pursuing strategic
relationships with large, high-volume merchandisers. The Company markets its
products through virtually every category of retailer including mass
merchandisers, catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs, department stores, hardware
stores, catalogues, television shopping channels, home centers, drug and
grocery stores, and pet supply retailers, as well as independent distributors
and the military post exchange services. The Company's largest customer,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 21% of sales in 1997.


     Retailers are pursuing a number of strategies in their competition to
deliver the highest-quality, lowest-cost brand name products. A growing trend
among retailers is to purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce
inventory costs and increase returns on investment. This trend has required
increased working capital investments for manufacturers and requires
manufacturers to more closely monitor consumer buying patterns as retailers
shorten their lead times for orders. Currently, most Sunbeam products sold to
U.S. retailers are manufactured at the Company's own facilities in North
America. However, one of the Company's goals for 1998 is to "source"
approximately fifty percent (50%) of parts and/or products from others,
including suppliers in Asia, in order to reduce capital investment in plants
while growing sales volume and to improve operating margins. The Company
intends to continue to support its retail partners' "just-in-time" inventory
strategies through investments in, among other things, improved forecasting
systems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution capabilities and
electronic communications. Currently, Sunbeam has approximately 90% of its U.S.
customer sales on electronic data interchange (EDI) systems.


     The amount of backlog orders at any point in time is not a significant
factor in the Company's business.


PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS


     Sunbeam believes that an integral part of its strength is its ability to
capitalize on the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and Oster/registered trademark/
trademarks which are registered in the United States and in numerous foreign
countries. Widely recognized throughout North America, South and Central
America and Europe, these registered trademarks, along with
Osterizer/registered trademark/, Mixmaster/registered trademark/, Toast
Logic/registered trademark/, Steammaster/registered trademark/,
Oskar/registered trademark/, Grillmaster/registered trademark/ and Blanket
with a Brain/registered trademark/ brands are important to the success of the
Company's products. Other important trademarks within Sunbeam include Oster
Designer/registered trademark/ line, Cuddle-Up/registered trademark/ and
A5/registered trademark/.


     Sunbeam holds numerous patents covering a wide variety of products, the
loss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business taken as a whole.


                                       5
<PAGE>

EMPLOYEES


     The Company currently has approximately 3,300 full-time domestic employees
and 4,200 international employees. None of the Company's domestic full-time
workforce has union representation. Sunbeam has had no material labor-related
work stoppages and, in the opinion of management, relations with its employees
are generally good.


SEASONALITY


     On a consolidated basis, Sunbeam sales do not exhibit substantial
seasonality. However, sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the
first half of the year, while sales of appliances and personal care and comfort
products are strongest in the second half of the year. In addition, sales of a
number of the Company's products, including warming blankets, vaporizers,
humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.
During 1997, the Company initiated early buy programs for highly seasonal
products such as grills and warming blankets in order to more levelize
production and distribution activities.


RAW MATERIALS


     The raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products are
available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal
requirements. The Company's primary raw materials include aluminum, steel,
resin, copper, and corrugated cardboard for cartons.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS


     The Company's operations, like those of comparable businesses, are subject
to certain federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations
in addition to laws and regulations regarding labeling and packaging of
products and the sale of products containing certain environmentally sensitive
materials ("Environmental Laws"). The Company believes it is in substantial
compliance with all Environmental Laws which are applicable to its operations.
Compliance with Environmental Laws involves certain continuing costs; however,
such costs of ongoing compliance have not resulted, and are not anticipated to
result, in a material increase in the Company's capital expenditures or to have
a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial
condition or competitive position.


     In addition to ongoing environmental compliance at its operations, the
Company also is actively engaged in certain environmental remediation
activities relating primarily to divested operations. As of December 31, 1997,
the Company had been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency ("EPA") or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible
party ("PRP") in connection with seven (7) sites subject to the federal
Superfund law and two (2) sites subject to state Superfund laws comparable to
the federal law (collectively the "Environmental Sites"), exclusive of sites at
which the Company has been designated (or expects to be designated) as a de
minimis (less than 1%) participant.


     The Superfund Act, and related state environmental remediation laws,
generally authorize governmental authorities to remediate a Superfund site and
to assess the costs against the PRPs or to order the PRPs to remediate the site
at their expense. Liability under the Superfund Law is joint and several and is
imposed on a strict basis, without regard to degree of negligence or
culpability. As a result, the Company recognizes its responsibility to
determine whether other PRPs at a Superfund site are financially capable of
paying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site.
Whenever the Company has determined that a particular PRP is not financially
responsible, it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that
such PRP will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation. To
minimize the Company's potential liability with respect to the Environmental
Sites, the Company has actively participated in steering committees and other
groups of PRPs established with respect to such sites. The Company currently is
engaged in active remediation activities at nine (9) sites, four (4) of which
are among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and five (5) of which have
not been designated as Superfund sites under federal or state law.


                                       6

     In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation
activities at a site located in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary
formerly conducted operations. The Company has been actively cooperating with
the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory
authorities in developing and implementing a plan for remediation of this site;
which remediation is anticipated to be substantially completed in 1998.


     The Company's costs for environmental remediation activities have not had
a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial
condition or competitive position. The Company has established reserves to
cover the anticipated probable costs of remediation, based upon periodic
reviews of all sites for which the Company has, or may have, remediation
responsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the amount of such reserves was
approximately four percent (4%) of the Company's total liabilities as set forth
in the consolidated financial statements. Such environmental reserves do not
anticipate any offsets for potential insurance recoveries from certain of the
Company's liability insurance carriers which the Company continues to pursue.


     Due to uncertainty over the remedial measures to be adopted at some sites,
the possibility of changes in the Environmental Laws, and the fact that joint
and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and
state Superfund sites, the Company's ultimate future liability with respect to
sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts
reserved at fiscal year end 1997. However, the Company believes, based on
existing information, that the costs of completing the environmental
remediation of all sites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility
have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.
 


     In December 1996, the Company reached a negotiated settlement with the EPA
with regard to a notice of violation concerning the construction and operation
of two paint lines at the Company's Neosho, MO facility prior to obtaining the
necessary permits for construction and operation. The negotiated settlement
amount of $829,825 recognizes the benefits of a "supplemental environmental
project" which consisted of the Company's installation of nominal emission
powder coating lines to replace solvent paint lines. In October 1997, the
Company executed a Consent Decree documenting the settlement and is awaiting
the EPA's execution of the Consent Decree; the Company anticipates formal
resolution of this matter by the second quarter of 1998.


     The Company is not a party to any other administrative or judicial
proceeding to which a governmental authority is a party and which involves
potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of $100,000 or
more.


CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS


     Certain of the information contained herein (including Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations)
contains "forward-looking" information, as that term is defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as the same may be amended (herein the
"Act") and in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
from time to time. Such "forward-looking" information may in included herein
under the following captions, among others: Item 1. Business--Restructuring and
Growth Plan, Pending Acquisitions, International, Competitive Strengths,
Customers, Raw Materials, Environmental Matters and Item 7--Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.


     These Cautionary Statements are being made pursuant to the Act, with the
intention of obtaining the benefits of the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Act.
The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the
Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors.

     /bullet/ The Company believes that it has sufficient management resources
to complete the pending acquisitions of Coleman, Signature Brands and First
Alert without negatively impacting on the Company's ongoing operations. In
addition, the Company expects to benefit from various operating synergies
arising from these acquisitions. If the Company fails to maintain its current
operations in the manner anticipated or fails to obtain the expected operating
synergies, such failures could negatively effect the Company's financial and/or
operating performance, which effect could be material.

     /bullet/ The Company expects to significantly increase the amount of its
outstanding indebtedness and to enter into financing arrangements which may
contain various restrictive covenants, in order to finance the acquisitions of
Coleman, Signature Brands and First Alert. The continuing cost of
servicing such debt could negatively effect the Company's future operations,
which effect could be material.

     /bullet/ The Company's performance should be expected to be affected by
the strength of the retail economy, primarily in the United States, but also in
Canada, Latin America and Asia. Weakness in


                                       7
<PAGE>

consumer confidence and retail outlets (including the financial weakness or
bankruptcy of retail outlets, especially mass merchants) should be expected to
adversely impact the Company's future financial results. In addition, the
extended credit terms provided by the Company in connection with its "early buy"
program increase the Company's risk of collection of accounts receivable.

     /bullet/ The Company operates in a highly competitive environment with
numerous competitors which are financially strong and capable of competing
effectively with the Company in the marketplace. Such competitors may take
actions to meet the Company's new product introductions and other initiatives.
Some competitors may be willing to accept lower margins and to reduce prices to
compete with the Company. As a result, the Company could fail to achieve
anticipated sales increases, to realize anticipated price increases, or
otherwise fail to meet its anticipated goals. Any of such circumstances would
likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance, which effect
could be material.

     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures approximately 70% of its
products. One of the Company's goals for 1998 is to source approximately 50% of
the Company's parts and/or products from third parties. The Company's ability
to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels is dependent upon
its ability to timely manufacture, source and deliver products which may be
sold for a profit. Labor difficulties, delays in delivery or pricing of raw
materials and/or sourced products, scheduling and transportation difficulties,
management dislocations and delays in development and manufacture of new
products can negatively affect operating profits. Although the Company will use
its best efforts to select suppliers for sourced product which are reliable and
dependable, the Company's planned increase in the percentage of sourced
products will decrease the Company's immediate control of product and, if such
suppliers fail to deliver products as anticipated, could have an adverse effect
on future financial performance, which effect could be material.

     /bullet/ As a consumer goods distributor, the Company's results of
operations can be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits, product
recall actions and/or by higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or
other returns of goods.

     /bullet/ The Company expects to substantially increase the amount of
business conducted by it outside North America. If the Company fails to achieve
anticipated market penetration in areas of the world into which the Company
currently expects to expand its sales, such event is likely to have an adverse
effect on the Company's future financial performance, which effect could be
material. Expansion of the Company's sales in foreign markets depends upon many
factors, including the states of economies in foreign countries, the strength
of consumer demand in those countries for products which the Company sells (or
expects to sell in those markets), the strength of competition from other
global consumer products companies and other factors which may negatively
affect the Company's anticipated performance in those markets. Although the
recent financial instability in Asia has not currently had any material impact
on the Company, if such conditions continue and/or worsen, they could
negatively impact the Company's ability to achieve anticipated sales growth in
such countries, the effect of which could be material to the Company's future
financial performance.

     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures some products and has sales in
such economies as those of Mexico and Venezuela, both of which economies have
been unstable or hyperinflationary in recent years. The economies of other
foreign countries important to the Company's expansion plans, including other
countries in Latin America and Asia, could suffer similar instability in the
future. Such factors as currency devaluations, new tariffs, changes in monetary
policies, inflation, governmental instability and similar matters could
negatively affect the Company's anticipated performance in foreign markets.
Although the Company plans to take advantage of recent economic and currency
fluctuations in certain Asian countries by increasing the Company's purchases
of products from such countries at lower prices, there is no guarantee that
such purchasing advantage will be fulfilled or will fully overcome any lost
sales opportunities in those same countries. As a result, the economic
conditions discussed above or any of these circumstances could have an adverse
effect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.

     /bullet/ A significant portion of the cost of goods manufactured by the
Company in North America is the cost of raw materials and/or components. The
Company has implemented changes in its purchasing


                                       8
<PAGE>

function which have enabled the Company to purchase materials more efficiently
and economically than it has in the past. The future success of the Company's
purchasing initiatives may be affected by many factors beyond the Company's
control, such as commodity pricing generally and higher prices for the specific
materials required by the Company. Although there are numerous suppliers
available for the materials and components sourced by the Company, any
unanticipated change in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the
Company. In addition, the Company's future initiatives to reduce the cost of
materials simply may not achieve savings in amounts comparable to those
previously obtained by the Company. A significant failure by the Company to
maintain material costs as anticipated would likely have an adverse effect on
anticipated future financial performance, which effect could be material.


     /bullet/ The Company anticipates realizing price increases from time to
time for certain of its products. The Company operates in a highly competitive
industry, and its ability to realize price increases may be limited due to
competitive pressures. If there is a material failure to realize anticipated
price increases, margins likely will be lower than anticipated by the Company,
and this will likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance,
which effect could be material.


     /bullet/ The Company anticipates that it will be able to more rapidly
develop and introduce a substantial number of new and innovative products in
the future. However, the Company may prove unable to meet its more aggressive
schedules for future product development. Failure to develop and manufacture
new products in the amounts and with the quality anticipated or a failure to
reduce the cycle time for new product introductions would likely have an
adverse effect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.
 


     /bullet/ Sales of certain of the Company's products can be negatively
impacted by unseasonable weather conditions during different seasons and
quarters of the year. For instance, the Company's sales of warming blankets
were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 1997 by moderate temperatures
in the northern states. The Company has attempted to levelize production,
marketing and other activities related to seasonal products by implementing an
"early buy" program; such a program shifts certain of the weather related risks
of negative sales impact for such seasonal products to later months of the
season and, as result, could have a negative impact on future financial
performance.


     /bullet/ The Company has entered into various arrangements with third
parties for the provision of back-office administrative services previously
provided with internal resources, including provision of all necessary computer
systems. Failure of any of these third party service providers to perform in
accordance with their respective agreements with the Company could result in
disruptions of the Company's normal business operations with a consequent
impact on sales, collections, cash flow and/or profitability.


     /bullet/ The Company's profitability may be negatively impacted by
underabsorption of manufacturing costs resulting from underutilization of
manufacturing capacity if the Company's sales growth is less than anticipated.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATION


YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996


     In November 1996, the Company initiated a major restructuring and growth
plan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the business
in order to restore higher levels of profitability for the Company. By July
1997, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. The
$225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuring
results primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within the
Company, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities
(including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and
warehouses from 61 to 18), the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including
3,300 from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below and
approximately 2,800 other positions), the centralization of the Company's
procurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting in
procurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished products
and the reduction of the Company's product offerings and stock keeping units
("SKU's"). The restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of the
Company's core product categories and the elimination of those businesses and
product lines that did not fit the core categories. Sunbeam's core product
categories are Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, Outdoor
Cooking and Away From Home. Product categories and businesses determined to be
non-core were divested in 1997, including the Company's furniture business and
its time and temperature, decorative bedding and Counselor/registered trademark/
and Borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. In addition, the Company
sold its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in 1997.


     Net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were $1,168.2 million, an
increase of $183.9 million or 18.7% over 1996. Net sales on a normalized basis,
after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued
operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding and
Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ branded scales),
increased 22.4% during the year.


     Global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five of
the Company's product categories primarily from new product introductions,
improved distribution (particularly with the Company's top ten customers),
international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certain
products. Global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25% in the
Appliance, Outdoor Cooking and Away From Home categories with sales increases
of 26.8%, 27.2% and 28.6%, respectively. Sales in the Health at Home category
increased 10.7% on a normalized basis and sales in the Personal Care and
Comfort category increased 3.4% during 1997.


     The Company's Appliance category sales increases were driven by new
products, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep
fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass
retailers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products increased in 1997 after three
straight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising and
advertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely new
line of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in the
fourth quarter of 1997 under a new "early buy" marketing program that included
among other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarter
of 1998. The Company sold approximately $50.0 million of Outdoor Cooking
Products under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. The early buy program
for Outdoor Cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels and
production efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distribution
activities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and to
drive additional retail sell-through of Outdoor Cooking products by reducing the
likelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter
1998 selling season.


     Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products were up over 30% through
September 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lower
than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets
in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen
sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. The Company anticipates
shifting to a more


                                       14
<PAGE>

level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the
seasonal demand for bedding products. Health at Home category sales increased
as a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.
Away from Home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including
cordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution of
commercially rated appliances. Also contributing to the Company's sales growth
in 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of
1997.


     International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew
31.2% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220
volt product introductions and the execution of 25 new international
distribution and license agreements. Revenue growth of approximately 34% was
achieved both in Mexico and by the Company's Latin American export sales
organization, and sales in Venezuela and Canada increased approximately 23%
each. European sales fell slightly in 1997, however the Company expects that
expanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additional
new distribution agreements will benefit European sales in 1998.


     The gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to
28.3%. This increase reflects the results of many cost savings and margin
enhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the Company's restructuring plan
coupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higher
revenues associated with the Company's growth plan. The Company initiated a
manufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted at
aggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,
including the Neosho, Missouri Outdoor Cooking Products facility which suffered
from poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grill
season. The benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impact
factory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. The
refinement of the Neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiation
of production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included a
revised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common parts
in the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increase
capacity and throughput.


     Operating earnings for 1997 were $199.4 million, an increase of $195.0
million over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. As a
percentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1% increased 16.6 percentage
points above last year's operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. The
operating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved gross
margin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")
costs in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regional
headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations
center, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative and
distribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company
wide cost control initiatives. In addition, SG&A during 1996 included
incremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and
other costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higher
than normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiatives
related to the launch of the Company's growth plan, and higher bad debt
expenses associated with certain of the Company's customers. The cost reduction
initiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997
resulted in SG&A decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4% in 1996
(excluding the impact of special charges) to 11.2% for 1997.


     Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in
1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due to
improved cash flows.


     The effective income tax of 35% for 1997 and 1996 for earnings (loss) from
continuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as a
result of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits and
loss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain state
income tax credits.


     The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was
$1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of
$2.37. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share
calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an increase
in the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value of
the Company's common stock in 1997.


                                       15
<PAGE>

     The Company's discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March
1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the
sale and break-even earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture operations
had net income of $.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated
loss on disposal of the business of $32.4 million, net of applicable income tax
benefits. The sale of the Company's furniture business assets (primarily
inventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March 1997.


     The Company received $69 million in cash and retained accounts receivable
related to the furniture business of approximately $50.0 million as of the
closing date. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject
to a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company
recorded an additional loss on disposal of $13.7 million, net of income tax
benefits. See discussion of Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in Note 8
and Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale in Note 9 to the Company's
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the
individual components of the 1996 special charge and details of the 1997
activity in the Company's restructuring accrual.


YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995


     The Company's operating results for 1996 include the effects of a pre-tax
special charge of $337.6 million recorded in conjunction with the
implementation of its restructuring and growth plan announced in November 1996.
Approximately 20% of the charge was for cash items primarily for severance
costs and lease and other facility exit costs. The special charge to earnings
in 1996 is included in the following categories on the consolidated statement
of operations (in millions):

</TABLE>

     Net sales from continuing operations of $984.2 million for 1996 represents
a decrease of $32.7 million, or 3.2%, from 1995. The Company experienced a loss
from continuing operations of $196.7 million or $2.37 per share for 1996 versus
earnings from continuing operations of $37.6 million or $.45 per share
(diluted) in 1995 primarily as a result of the restructuring activities
discussed above. The net loss for 1996 was $228.3 million, or $2.75 per share,
compared to net earnings of $50.5 million, or $0.61 per share (diluted), for
1995. Excluding the impact of special charge items for 1996, earnings from
continuing operations before income taxes decreased from $60.6 million in 1995
to a loss of $12.9 million in 1996.


     Domestic sales represented approximately 80% of total sales of the Company
in 1996 and decreased $28.5 million or 3.4% from 1995. This sales decline was
driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3% and
lower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0% from 1995, primarily as
result of lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December 1996). Domestic
sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products
such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on
breadmakers. Sales of other product categories such as health and personal care
products and time and temperature products (divested in March 1997) were either
flat or declined slightly from 1995 levels.


     International sales decreased $4.2 million or 2.2% from 1995 primarily as
a result of lower sales in Latin America due to political and/or economic
instability in several countries such as Ecuador, Peru, Columbia and Venezuela
(which suffered a bolivar devaluation in April 1996), a sales decline of 11.2%


                                       16
<PAGE>

in Canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the Company's then largest
Canadian customer offset by a 55.0% increase in sales in Mexico as a result of
a more stable economic environment in 1996.


     The Company's gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of special
charges, was 17.9% of sales in 1996, down from 20.4% in 1995, primarily from
the underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing
capacity that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond by the Company's
restructuring and growth plan cost reduction initiatives.


     Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, excluding the
impact of special charges described above, were 17.6% of sales in 1996
primarily as a result of an inflated cost structure that has been realigned for
1997 and beyond. In addition, a $12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 media
advertising campaign and one-time expenditures for market research, new
packaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normal
SG&A spending in 1996. Also included in 1996 SG&A costs were $7.7 million of
compensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards made in connection
with the employment of a new senior management team.


     Interest expense for 1996 increased from $9.4 million in 1995 to $13.6
million as a result of increased indebtedness of the Company for working
capital requirements and non-recurring capitalized interest in 1995 related to
the construction of the Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center.


     The effective income tax rate for 1996 decreased 3 percentage points from
1995 to 35.0% as a result of certain foreign and state operating losses for
which no tax benefits were recorded and the non-deductibility of compensation
expense related to restricted stock awards.


     The Company's discontinued furniture operations had revenues of $227.5
million in 1996, up 22.6% from $185.6 million in 1995. This revenue growth was
the result of the acquisition of the Samsonite/registered trademark/ furniture
business in November 1995. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture
business sales declined 2.1%. Earnings from the discontinued furniture
operations, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $.8 million in
1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,
underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. In
addition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsonite/registered
trademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,
particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.


FOREIGN OPERATIONS


     During 1997 approximately 90% of the Company's business was conducted in
U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export
sales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority
of European sales). The Company's exposure to market risk from changes in
foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company's
non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in
Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary
economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and Mexico reverted to
hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation
adjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are included
as a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were not material
to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.


     On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign
exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures
that arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are
entered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did
not have a material impact on the Company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and
1997. See Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


     As of December 28, 1997, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$52.4 million and total debt of $195.2 million. Cash used in operating
activities during 1997 was $8.2 million compared to $14.2


                                       17
<PAGE>

million provided by operating activities in 1996. This decrease is primarily
attributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in 1997 and the
utilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the Company's
restructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales
in 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997
necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the Company's
initiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expenditures
required to implement the restructuring plan. In addition, cash used in
operating activities reflects $59 million of proceeds from the sale of trade
accounts receivable under the Company's revolving trade accounts receivable
securitization program entered into in December 1997 as more fully described in
Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.


     Capital spending totaled $58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for new
products, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. Capital spending
in 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinued
furniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new product
development, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansion
financed with a capital lease. Capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately
$59.4 million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million related
to new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinued
furniture business. The remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost
reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance
including $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cooking
products. The Company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%
of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions
and certain facility rationalization initiatives.


     Cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million in
proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined to
be non-core to the Company's ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996
restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the
purchase of a portion of the Company's furniture business, which was
subsequently divested in full in March 1997.


     Cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 and
reflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's revolving credit
facility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture
operations and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the
exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the
Company. In 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million was
primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to support
working capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in new
issuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of
treasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In July 1997, the Company
reduced the amount of available borrowings under its September 1996 unsecured
five year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250 million.


     The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantially
all related to previously divested operations. In connection with the Company's
restructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures was
undertaken and the Company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and
settlement of certain environmental claims. This review and change in strategy
resulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more
fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In
management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters
will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.


     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced the signing of definitive
agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. and
First Alert, Inc. Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the
second quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including
regulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. In connection with the
acquisitions, the Company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt of
the acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existing
long-term debt. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of the
acquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolving
and term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrent
with the acquisition closings. Refer to Note 14 for additional information
regarding the pending acquisitions.


     The Company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash
equivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds of
the anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient to
support working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisition
related cash requirements for the foreseeable future.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Sunbeam Corporation:


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sunbeam
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 29, 1996
and December 28, 1997 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 28, 1997. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.


     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Sunbeam Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 29, 1996 and December 28, 1997, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 28, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


ORGANIZATION


     Sunbeam Corporation ("Sunbeam" or the "Company") is a leading manufacturer
and marketer of branded consumer products. The Sunbeam/registered trademark/
and Oster/registered trademark/ brands have been household names for
generations, and the Company is a market share leader in many of its product
categories.


     The Company markets its products through virtually every category of
retailer including mass merchandisers, catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs,
department stores, catalogs, television shopping channels, Company-owned outlet
stores, hardware stores, home centers, drug and grocery stores, pet supply
retailers, as well as independent distributors and the military. The Company
also sells its products to commercial end users such as hotels and other
institutions.


     Approximately 79% of total Company sales are generated in the United
States. The remaining sales are generated primarily in Latin America, Mexico,
Canada, Europe and Asia.


PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION


     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all majority-owned subsidiaries that it controls. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.


PRESENTATION OF FISCAL PERIODS


     The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. Fiscal
years 1997, 1996 and 1995 ended on December 28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and
December 31, 1995 respectively, which encompassed 52-week periods.


USE OF ESTIMATES


     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Significant accounting estimates include the establishment of
the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for product warranty, product
liability, excess and obsolete inventory, litigation and environmental
exposures.


CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK


     Substantially all of the Company's trade receivables are due from
retailers and distributors located throughout the United States, Latin America
and Canada. Approximately 36% of the Company's sales in 1997 were to its five
largest customers. The Company establishes its credit policies based on an
ongoing evaluation of its customers' creditworthiness and competitive market
conditions and establishes its allowance for doubtful accounts based on an
assessment of exposures to credit losses at each balance sheet date. The
Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient based on the
credit exposures outstanding at December 28, 1997. However, certain retailers
filed for bankruptcy protection in the last several years and it is possible
that additional credit losses could be incurred if the trends of retail
consolidation continue.

INVENTORIES


     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being
determined principally by the first-in, first-out method.


PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT


     Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. The Company provides for
depreciation using primarily the straight-line method in amounts that allocate
the cost of property, plant and equipment over the following useful lives:



<TABLE>
<S>                                                 <C>
       Buildings and improvements ...............   20 to 40 years
       Machinery, equipment and tooling .........    3 to 15 years
       Furniture and fixtures ...................    3 to 10 years
</TABLE>

     Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of its estimated useful life or the term of the lease.


LONG-LIVED ASSETS


     The Company accounts for long-lived assets pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT
OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF. See Notes 8
and 9 for a discussion of asset impairment charges in 1996.


CAPITALIZED INTEREST


     Interest costs for the construction of certain long-term assets are
capitalized and amortized over the related assets' estimated useful lives.
Total interest costs during 1997 and 1996 amounted to $12.3 million and $14.0
million respectively, of which $.9 million and $.4 million respectively, was
capitalized into the construction cost of the long-term assets.


AMORTIZATION PERIODS


     Trademarks and trade names are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.


REVENUE RECOGNITION


     The Company recognizes revenues from product sales principally at the time
of shipment to customers. In limited circumstances, at the customers request
the Company may sell seasonal product on a bill and hold basis provided that
the goods are completed, packaged and ready for shipment, such goods are
segregated and the risks of ownership and legal title have passed to the
customer. The amount of such bill and hold sales at December 29, 1997 was
approximately 3% of consolidated revenues.


     Net sales is comprised of gross sales less provisions for expected
customer returns, discounts, promotional allowances and cooperative
advertising.


WARRANTY COSTS


     The Company provides for warranty costs in amounts it estimates will be
needed to cover future warranty obligations for products sold during the year.
Estimates of warranty costs are periodically reviewed and adjusted, when
necessary, to consider actual experience.

                                      F-8

ADVERTISING COSTS


     Media advertising costs included in "Selling, General and Administrative
Expense," are expensed as incurred. Co-operative advertising costs are expensed
ratably over the year in relation to revenues.


FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION


     The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, other than those operating in
highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
exchange rates, with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a
separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are
converted into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year.


     For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, (Venezuela
and Mexico) inventories and property, plant and equipment are translated at the
rate of exchange on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and
liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments
for those operations are included in "Other (income) expense, net" on the
Accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.


STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS


     SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION allows either
adoption of a fair value method for accounting for stock-based compensation
plans or continuation of accounting under Accounting Principles Board ("APB")
Opinion No.  25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, and related
interpretations with supplemental disclosures.


     The Company has chosen to account for its stock options using the
intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 and, accordingly,
does not recognize compensation expense for stock option grants made at an
exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the stock at
the date of grant. Pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts as if
the fair value method had been adopted are presented in Note 5 herein. SFAS No.
123 does not impact the Company's results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK


     In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. Basic
earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing earnings
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock. Diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing earnings
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding (all related to
outstanding stock options and restricted stock discussed in Note 5). The
Company's reported primary earnings per share for 1995 has been restated to
comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128 had no impact on the
Company's reported loss per share for 1996 and no impact on the diluted
earnings per share reported in 1995. The effect of this accounting change on
previously reported earnings per share (EPS) for 1995 was as follows:

       Primary EPS as reported ....................    $  0.45

       Basic EPS as restated ......................       0.62
</TABLE>

RECLASSIFICATION


     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1997
presentation.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS


     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS No. 130 establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in the financial statements. SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997. Reclassification of financial statements for
earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required. The Company is
in the process of determining its preferred format. The adoption of SFAS No.
130 will have no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.


     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF
AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
the way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.
SFAS No. 131 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997. Financial statement disclosures for prior periods are
required to be restated. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
disclosure requirements. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 will have no impact on
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

2. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY


     The Company has 200,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock
authorized. At December 28, 1997 there were 9,404,068 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options.


     In June 1995, the Company retired 7,376,395 shares of common stock held in
treasury, and such shares were returned to the status of authorized but
unissued shares. As a result, $103.7 million assigned to treasury stock has
been eliminated with a corresponding decrease to common stock, paid-in capital
and retained earnings. In 1995, the Company repurchased 905,600 shares of its
common stock at a total cost of $13.1 million.


     In July 1996, the Company sold 321,786 shares of common stock for total
proceeds of approximately $4.4 million, and granted 1,100,000 shares of
restricted stock in connection with the employment of a new Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and certain other officers of the Company. Compensation
expense attributable to the restricted stock awards is being amortized to
expense beginning in 1996 over the periods in which the restrictions lapse
(which in the case of 333,333 shares, was immediately upon the date of grant,
in the case of 666,667 shares, is equally over two years from the date of grant
and in the case of the remaining restricted shares, is equally over three years
from the dates of grant).


     On February 20, 1998 the Company entered into new three-year employment
agreements with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other senior
officers of the Company. These agreements replaced previous employment
agreements entered into in July 1996 that were scheduled to expire in July 1999.
Refer to Note 14 for additional information regarding the new employment
contracts, including the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock grants
discussed above.

3. CREDIT FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT


     In 1994, the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation ("MBFC") issued $75
million of 7.85% Industrial Development Revenue Notes (the "Notes") maturing
serially in eleven equal annual installments beginning June 1999 to certain
institutional investors through a private placement. The MBFC loaned the
proceeds of the Notes to a subsidiary of the Company under a non-recourse loan
agreement (the "Hattiesburg Loan") restricting the use of such funds to the
acquisition, design, construction and equipping of the Hattiesburg, Mississippi
manufacturing and distribution center. The Notes are guaranteed by the Company
and the Hattiesburg Loan is secured by the Hattiesburg facility.


     In September 1996 (as subsequently amended), the Company entered into a
$500 million syndicated unsecured five year revolving credit facility (the
"Credit Agreement") which replaced a previous credit facility of $500 million.
In July 1997, the Company reduced the amount of available borrowings under the
facility to $250 million. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company can borrow
under a competitive bid option, or at a spread above LIBOR (currently .5%) or
at a bank base rate. In addition, the Company pays an annual facility fee
(currently .25%). The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants.

3. CREDIT FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT--(CONTINUED)

     During 1997, the Company repaid $12.2 million of long-term borrowings
related to the divested furntiture operations and other assets sold.


     The aggregate annual principal payments on long-term debt, excluding
amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, due in each of the years
1998-2002, are $.7 million, $7.5 million, $7.6 million, $7.6 million and $7.7
million, respectively.


     Long-term debt at the end of each fiscal year consists of the following

     In December 1997, the Company entered into a revolving trade accounts
receivable securitization program to sell without recourse, through a
wholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accounts receivable. The maximum amount
of receivables that can be sold through this program is $70 million. At December
28, 1997, the Company had received approximately $59 million from the sale of
trade accounts receivable. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. Costs of the program,
which primarily consist of the purchaser's financing cost of issuing commercial
paper backed by the receivables, totaled $.2 million during 1997, and have been
classified as interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company, as agent for the purchaser of the receivables, retains
collection and administrative responsibilities for the purchased receivables.


4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


     The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments as of December
28, 1997 approximate market values based upon the following methods and
assumptions:


     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS--The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents is assumed to approximate fair value as cash equivalents include
all highly liquid, short-term investments with original maturities of three
months or less.


     SHORT AND LONG TERM DEBT--The carrying value of the Company's various debt
outstanding as of December 28, 1997 approximates market. The fair value of the
Company's fixed rate debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis,
based upon the market yield of public debt securities of comparable credit
quality and maturity. The carrying value of the Company's variable rate debt is
assumed to approximate market based upon periodic adjustments of the interest
rate to the current market rate in accordance with the terms of the debt
agreements.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS--(CONTINUED)

     LETTERS OF CREDIT--The Company utilizes stand-by letters of credit to back
certain financing instruments and insurance policies and commercial letters of
credit guaranteeing various international trade activities. The contract
amounts of the letters of credit approximate their fair value.


DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


     The Company selectively uses derivatives to manage interest rate and
foreign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. The use
of derivatives did not have a material impact on the Company's results of
operations in 1997, 1996 and 1995. No derivatives are entered into for trading
or speculative purposes. Foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used
to hedge a portion of the Company's underlying exposures denominated in foreign
currency. Although the market value of derivative contracts at any single point
in time will vary with changes in interest and/or foreign exchange rates, the
difference between the carrying value and fair value of such contracts at
December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995 is not considered to be material,
either individually or in the aggregate. The Company had no derivative
financial instruments outstanding at December 28, 1997. The Company enters into
derivative contracts with counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy.
The Company does not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.


     As of December 28, 1996, $10.0 million of the Company's outstanding
floating rate debt was subject to interest rate swap agreements.


     In order to mitigate the transaction exposures that may arise from changes
in foreign exchange rates, the Company purchases foreign currency option
contracts to hedge anticipated transactions. The option contracts typically
expire within one year. Any realized gains on options are not deferred but are
recognized in income in the period when the hedged exposure is recognized. The
Company purchased options with a notional value of $16.6 million in 1997, $18.2
million in 1996 and $11.7 million in 1995. Options with notional value of $17.9
million, $25.4 million and $3.2 million expired in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The Company held purchased option contracts with a notional value
of $1.4 million at December 29, 1996.


5. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS


     The Company has one stock-based compensation plan, the Amended and
Restated Sunbeam Corporation Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan,
all employees are eligible for grants of options to purchase up to an aggregate
of 11,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal
to or in excess of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The
term of each option commences on the date of grant and expires on the tenth
anniversary of the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a
three to five year period.


     The Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards of up to
200,000 shares, in the aggregate, to employees and non-employee directors. See
Note 2 for a discussion of restricted stock awards made outside the Plan.


     In July 1996, options to purchase an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares (of
which 2,750,000 options were outstanding at December 28, 1997) were granted
outside of the Plan at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
Company's common stock on the dates of grant in connection with the employment
of a new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive
officers of the Company. These outstanding options have terms of ten years and,
with respect to options for 2,500,000 shares, are

     exercisable in three annual installments beginning July 17, 1996. Options
for the remaining 250,000 shares still outstanding are exercisable in three
annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the July 22, 1996
grant date. On February 20, 1998 the vesting provisions of the options granted
outside the Plan were accelerated as further described in Note 14.


     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for outstanding stock options. Had compensation cost for the
Company's outstanding stock options been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for those options consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's
net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands except per share
amounts):

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS


RETIREMENT PLANS


     The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans covering
eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees. Benefit accruals under such plans
covering all U.S. salaried employees were frozen, effective December 31, 1990.
Therefore no credit in the pension formula is given for service or compensation
after that date. However, employees continue to earn service toward vesting in
their interest in the frozen plans as of December 31, 1990. Employees of
non-U.S. subsidiaries generally receive retirement benefits from Company
sponsored plans or from statutory plans administered by governmental agencies
in their countries.

     The Company funds its pension plans in amounts consistent with applicable
laws and regulations. Pension plan assets include corporate and U.S. government
bonds and cash equivalents.


     The assets, liabilities and pension costs of the Company's non-U.S.
defined benefit retirement plans are not material to the consolidated financial
statements.


OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS


     The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain
former employees who retired from the Company prior to March 31, 1991. The
Company has consistently followed a policy of funding the cost of
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go
basis.


     Effective July 1993, various amendments to the Company's postretirement
benefits program were adopted. The amendments included increases in retiree
contribution levels for certain retiree groups and the discontinuation of
medical and/or life insurance coverage for certain retirees who qualify for
Medicare. These amendments resulted in an unrecognized reduction in prior
service cost which is being amortized over future years.

</TABLE>

     The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation is 8.8% for 1998 and is assumed to decrease
gradually to 6% by 2003 and remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage
point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 28,
1997 and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1997 by approximately
8%. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25% at December 28, 1997 and December
29, 1996.


DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS


     The Company sponsors defined contribution profit sharing plans covering
eligible employees. Company contributions to these plans include employer
matching contributions as well as discretionary profit sharing contributions
depending on the performance of the Company, in an amount up to 10% of eligible
compensation. The Company provided $1.8 million in 1997, $1.7 million in 1996
and $4.1 million in 1995 for its defined contribution plans.

NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS


     In connection with a warehouse expansion related to the electric blanket
business, the Company entered into a $5 million capital lease obligation in
1996.


8. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS


     In November 1996, the Company announced the details of its restructuring
and growth plan. The cost reduction phase of the plan included the
consolidation of administrative functions within the Company, the
rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities, the centralization
of the Company's procurement function, and reduction of the Company's product
offerings and stock keeping units ("SKU's"). The Company also announced plans
to divest several lines of business which it determined are not core for
Sunbeam (see Note 9).


     In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company consolidated six
divisional and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide
corporate headquarters in Delray Beach, Florida and outsourced certain back
office activities resulting in a 50% reduction in total
back-office/administrative headcount. Overall, the restructuring plan calls for
a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and the
elimination of over 6,000 positions from the Company's workforce, including
3,300 from the disposition of non-core business operations and the elimination
of approximately 2,800 other positions. The Company completed the major phases
of the restructuring plan by January 1997.


     In conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring and growth
plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge to earnings of
approximately $337.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. This amount is
allocated as follows in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations:
$154.9 million to Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs as further
described below; $92.3 million to Cost of Goods Sold related principally to
inventory write-downs from the reduction in SKU's and costs of inventory
liquidation programs; $42.5 million to Selling, General and Administrative
expenses principally for increases in environmental and litigation reserves
(see Note 12) and other reserve categories; and the estimated pre-tax loss on
the divestiture of the Company's furniture business of approximately $47.9
million. During the first quarter of 1997, upon completion of the sale, the
Company provided for additional losses on the disposal of the furniture
business of $13.7 million, net of applicable income tax benefits as a result of
lower than anticipated sales proceeds.

9. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER ASSETS HELD FOR SALE


     As part of the restructuring plan and redefinition of its core businesses,
the Company also announced the divestiture of the furniture business, by a sale
of assets. In February 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the
business to U.S. Industries, Inc. which was completed on March 17, 1997. In
connection with the sale of these assets (primarily inventory, property, plant
and equipment), the Company received $69 million in cash. The Company retained
accounts receivable related to the furniture business of approximately $50.0
million as of the closing date.


     In connection with the furniture divestiture, the Company recorded a
provision for estimated losses to be incurred on the sale of $32.4 million in
1996, net of applicable income tax benefits and an additional loss of $13.7
million, net of applicable income tax benefits in the first quarter of 1997 as a
result of lower than anticipated sales proceeds. Earnings from the discontinued
furniture business were $.8 million in 1996 and $12.9 million in 1995, net of
applicable income taxes of $.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Earnings
from the discontinued furniture business in 1997 were not material. Revenues for
the discontinued furniture business were $51.6 million in 1997, $227.5 million
in 1996 and $185.6 million in 1995. These revenues are not included in net sales
as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.


     In addition to the furniture business divestiture, the Company also
completed the sale of other non-core product lines and assets in 1997 as part
of its restructuring plan, including time and temperature products,
Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ scales and a
textile facility. Losses incurred on the disposal of these assets, which
consist primarily of write-downs of assets to net realizable value, are
included in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in 1996 in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as described in Note 8.

     Deferred U.S. income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered to be permanently
reinvested. At December 28, 1997, the cumulative amount of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries on which U.S. federal income taxes have not
been provided was approximately $51.5 million. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practical because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however,
unrecognized foreign tax credit carryovers would be available to reduce some
portion of the U.S. liability.


11. CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA


     Classes of products which contributed more than 10% to consolidated sales
were outdoor home use durable products and indoor home use durable products.
Sales of outdoor home use durable products amounted to $325.8 million in 1997,
$256.9 million in 1996 and $269.0 million in 1995. Sales of indoor home use
durable products were $769.6 million in 1997, $680.7 million in 1996 and $688.3
million in 1995.


     The Company's largest customer accounted for approximately 21% of
consolidated net sales in 1997 and 19% in 1996 and 1995.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS


     The Company's operations, like those of comparable businesses, are subject
to certain federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and
regulations. As of December 28, 1997, the Company had been identified as a
potentially responsible party ("PRP") in connection with seven sites subject to
the federal Superfund law and two sites subject to state Superfund laws
comparable to the federal law (collectively the "Environmental Sites"),
exclusive of sites at which the Company has been designated (or expects to be
designated) as a de minimis (less than 1%) participant. Substantially all of
these sites relate to divested operations of the Company.


     The Company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine
sites, four of which are among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and
five of which have not been designated as Superfund sites under federal or
state law. In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation
activities at a site in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary formerly
conducted

operations. The Company has been actively cooperating with the United States
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory authorities in developing a
plan for remediation of this site; which remediation is expected to be
substantially completed during 1998.


     The Company has established reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies, to cover the anticipated probable costs of
remediation, based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the Company
has, or may have remediation responsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the
amount of such reserves was less than 5% of the Company's total liabilities as
set forth in the consolidated financial statements. Liability under the
Superfund law is joint and several and is imposed on a strict basis, without
regard to degree of negligence or culpability. As a result, the Company
recognizes its responsibility to determine whether other PRP's at a Superfund
site are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate
cost of remediation of the site. Whenever the Company has determined that a
particular PRP is not financially responsible, it has assumed for purposes of
establishing reserve amounts that such PRP will not pay its respective share of
the costs of remediation. To minimize the Company's potential liability with
respect to the Environmental Sites, the Company has actively participated in
steering committees and other groups of PRP's established with respect to such
sites. The Company continues to pursue the recovery of some environmental
remediation costs from certain of its liability insurance carriers; however,
such potential recoveries have not been offset against potential liabilities
and have not been considered in determining the Company's environmental
reserves.


     Due to uncertainty over remedial measures to be adopted at some sites, the
possibility of changes in environmental laws and regulations and the fact that
joint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at
federal and state Superfund sites, the Company's ultimate future liability with
respect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the
amounts reserved as of December 28, 1997. In connection with the Company's
restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 1996 a comprehensive review of all
environmental exposures was performed, and the Company accelerated its strategy
for the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. As a result,
the Company recorded additional environmental reserves of approximately $9.0
million in the fourth quarter of 1996. The Company believes, based on existing
information, that the costs of completing environmental remediation of all
sites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility have been
adequately reserved, and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.


LEASES


     The Company rents certain facilities, equipment and retail stores under
operating leases. Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $7.4 million
in 1997, $8.0 million for 1996 and $8.6 million for 1995. The minimum future
rentals due under noncancelable operating leases as of December 28, 1997
aggregated $30.9 million. The amounts payable in each of the years 1998-2002 and
thereafter are $4.8 million, $4.6 million, $4.2 million, $3.9 million, $3.4
million and $10.0 million, respectively.


CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS


     Responsibility for servicing certain debt obligations of the Company's
predecessor were assumed by third parties in connection with the acquisition of
former businesses, although the Company's predecessor remained the primary
obligor in accordance with the respective loan documents. Such

obligations, which amounted to approximately $19.0 million at December 28,
1997, and the corresponding receivables from the third parties, are not
included in the consolidated balance sheets since these transactions occurred
prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 76, Extinguishment of Debt. Management
believes that the third parties will continue to meet their obligations
pursuant to the assumption agreements.


     Letters of credit aggregating $28.6 million were outstanding as of
December 28, 1997.


LITIGATION


     The Company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time in
the ordinary course of business or and related to divested operations of the
Company. The Company has established reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies, to cover the anticipated probable costs of
litigation matters, based upon periodic reviews of all cases.


     The Company believes, based on existing information, that anticipated
probable costs of litigation matters have been adequately reserved, and that
the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect upon the Company's financial condition.


PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS


     The Company is party to various personal injury and property damage
lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business. Annually, the
Company sets its product liability insurance program based on the Company's
current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of
insurance. The Company's program for 1997 was comprised of a self-insurance
retention of $1 million per occurrence.


     Cumulative amounts estimated to be payable by the Company with respect to
pending and potential claims for all years in which the Company is liable under
its self-insurance retention have been accrued as liabilities. Such accrued
liabilities are necessarily based on estimates (which include actuarial
determinations made by independent actuarial consultants as to liability
exposure, taking into account prior experience, numbers of claims and other
relevant factors); thus, the Company's ultimate liability may exceed or be less
than the amounts accrued. The methods of making such estimates and establishing
the resulting liability are reviewed continually and any adjustments resulting
therefrom are reflected in current operating results.


     Historically, product liability awards have rarely exceeded the Company's
individual per occurrence self-insured retention. There can be no assurance,
however, that the Company's future product liability experience will be
consistent with its past experience. Based on existing information, the Company
believes that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending product liability
claims and lawsuits of the Company, individually or in the aggregate, will not
have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS


     On February 20, 1998 the Company entered into new three-year employment
agreements with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other senior
officers of the Company. These agreements replaced previous employment
agreements entered into in July 1996 that were scheduled to expire in July
1999.


     The new employment agreement for the Company's Chairman provides for,
among other items, the acceleration of vesting of 200,000 shares of restricted
stock and the forfeiture of the remaining 133,333 shares of unvested restricted
stock granted under the July 1996 agreement as further described in Note 2, a
new equity grant of 300,000 shares of unrestricted stock, a new grant of a
ten-year option to purchase 3,750,000 shares of the Company's common stock with
an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of
grant and exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the date
of grant and the acceleration of vesting of 833,333 outstanding stock options
granted under the July 1996 agreement as further described in Note 5. In
addition, the new employment agreement with the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer provides for tax gross-ups with respect to any tax assessed on the
equity grant and acceleration of vesting of restricted stock.


     The new employment agreements with the two other senior officers provide
for, among other items, the grant of a total of 180,000 shares of restricted
stock that vest in four equal annual installments beginning the date of grant,
the acceleration of vesting of 44,000 shares of restricted stock and the
forfeiture of the remaining 29,332 shares of unvested restricted stock granted
under the July 1996 agreements, new grants of ten-year options to purchase a
total of 1,875,000 shares of the Company's common stock with an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant and
exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning on the date of grant
and the acceleration of vesting of 383,334 outstanding stock options granted
under the July 1996 agreements. In addition, the new employment agreements
provide for tax gross-ups with respect to any tax assessed on the restricted
stock grants and acceleration of vesting of restricted stock.


     Compensation expense attributed to the equity grant, the acceleration of
vesting of restricted stock and the related tax gross-ups will be recognized in
the first quarter of 1998 and compensation expense related to the new
restricted stock grants and related tax gross-ups will be amortized to expense
beginning in the first quarter of 1998 over the period in which the
restrictions lapse. Total after-tax compensation expense to be recognized in
the first quarter of 1998 related to these items is expected to be
approximately $30.0 million.


PENDING ACQUISITIONS


     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced the signing of three definitive
agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. and
First Alert, Inc., Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the
second quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including
regulatory approvals, and acquisition financings. Each of the acquisitions will
be accounted for under the purchase method, whereby the purchase price will be
allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon
their estimated fair values.


     The acquisition of The Coleman Company, Inc., the global leader in outdoor
recreational and hardware products is valued at approximately $2.0 billion,
consisting of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $811 million,
cash of approximately $260 million and assumed debt. Shareholders of The Coleman
Company, Inc. will receive $6.44 in cash and .5677 shares of the Company's stock
for each share of Coleman stock.


     The acquisition of Signature Brands USA, Inc., the North American leader in
coffeemakers marketed under the Mr. Coffee/registered trademark/ brand name and
a leader in consumer health products marketed under the Health O
Meter/registered trademark/ brand is valued at approximately $250 million,
consisting of cash of $8.25 per share of Signature Brand common stock and the
assumption of existing debt.


     The acquisition of First Alert, Inc., the worldwide leader in residential
safety equipment, including smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors is
valued at approximately $175 million, consisting of cash of $5.25 per share of
First Alert common stock and the assumption of existing debt. 

     The Company plans on refinancing all or substantially all of the assumed
debt of the acquired companies concurrent with the transactions closings.

Exhibit 10a

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

                  AGREEMENT, effective as of February 1, 1998 (the "Effective
Date"), and executed on February 20, 1998 (the "Execution Date"), by and between
ALBERT J. DUNLAP (the "Executive") and SUNBEAM CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS, the Executive is a party to the Employment Agreement
with the Company dated as of July 18, 1996 (the "Prior Agreement"):

                  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
desires to continue to employ the Executive and the Executive desires to
continue to furnish services to the Company on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth;

                  WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions of the employment relationship of the
Executive with the Company; and

                  WHEREAS, the parties desire to provide for the termination of
the Prior Agreement, effective upon the Effective Date;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements set forth below, the parties hereby agree as follows:

                  1. EMPLOYMENT. The Company hereby agrees to employ the
Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth.

                  2. EMPLOYMENT PERIOD. The period of employment of the
Executive by the Company hereunder (the "Employment Period") shall commence as
of the Effective Date and shall end on January 31, 2001 (or the Date of
Termination (as defined in Section 6 below), if earlier). All options awards
granted pursuant to the Prior Agreement shall vest and become exercisable in
full as of the Execution Date. In addition, 40% of the restricted stock granted
pursuant to the Prior Agreement which is subject to restrictions immediately
prior


<PAGE>

to the Execution Date shall be forfeited as of the Execution Date, and the
remaining shares of such restricted stock shall become vested in full as of the
Execution Date and the Company shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up
basis for any federal income tax assessed upon him upon the vesting of such
restricted stock. Commencing on February 1, 2001, the Employment Period shall be
extended for successive one year periods (individually, a "Renewal Period"),
unless a notice not to extend this Agreement shall have been given by either
party hereto to the other not later than August 1 immediately preceding the
commencement of a Renewal Period or unless the Date of Termination shall have
previously occurred; provided, however, that the last such Renewal Period shall
be the Renewal Period ending on January 31, 2003. Unless the context suggests
otherwise, the Employment Period hereunder shall for all purposes of this
Agreement be deemed to include any Renewal Period.

                  3. POSITION AND DUTIES. The Executive shall serve as Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company and
shall report directly to the Board. During the Employment Period, subject to the
supervisory powers of the Board, the Executive shall have those powers and
duties consistent with his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, which powers shall in all cases include, without limitation, the power
of supervision and control over and responsibility for the general management
and operation of the Company. The Executive agrees to devote substantially all
his working time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties for
the Company. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to
(i) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (ii) give
speeches and make media appearances to discuss matters of public interest and
(iii) manage his personal investments, so long as such activities do not
unreasonably interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities
as an officer of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is understood
that the Executive has made a commitment to appear in various cities in the
United States in connection with a book entitled Mean Business, of which he is a
co-author, and it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive
to make such appearances (the expenses relating to such appearances to be borne
by the Executive). The Company shall nominate the Executive as a director of the
Company and shall use its best efforts to have the Executive elected and
reelected to the Board for the duration of the Employment Period. The Company
shall also use its best efforts to cause three individuals, designated by the
Executive to be elected and reelected as directors of the Company for the
duration of the Employment Period. In the event that any of such individuals
fails to qualify or be elected (or, having been elected, resigns, is removed or
fails to be re-elected) during the Employment

                                        2

<PAGE>

Period, the Executive shall designate a successor reasonably acceptable to the
Board and the Company shall nominate such person as a director and shall use its
best efforts to cause such person to be elected and reelected.

                  4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The principal place of employment of
the Executive shall be at the Company's principal executive offices in Palm
Beach County, Florida, or such other location as may be agreed to by the Board
and the Executive. In the event that the Company's principal executive offices
are moved from Palm Beach County, Florida, the Company shall promptly pay, or
reimburse the Executive for, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive
for a period of one year relating to any change of the Executive's residence
from Boca Raton, Florida, in connection with his employment hereunder,
including, without limitation, reasonable expenses for himself and his family of
travel, moving, storage and suitable lodging and maintenance, and the Company
shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis in the event that any tax is
assessed upon him in relation to any such expenses. The Company shall pay or
reimburse the Executive for all reasonable costs and expenses of residential
relocation incurred by him for a period of one year in connection with each and
every additional change, if any, in the location of the principal executive
offices of the Company, and the Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company on
a grossed up basis in the event that any tax is assessed upon him in relation to
any such costs or expenses.

                  5. COMPENSATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

                           (a) BASE SALARY. As compensation for the performance
by the Executive of his duties hereunder, during the Employment Period the
Company shall pay the Executive a base salary at an annual rate of $2,000,000,
which rate shall be retroactive to the Effective Date (the base salary, at the
rate in effect from time to time, is hereinafter referred to as the "Base
Salary"). Except for the adjustment necessary to implement the retroactive
increase in Base Salary described in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Base Salary shall be payable in equal semi-monthly installments and may be
increased from time to time at the discretion of the Company's Compensation
Committee (or any successor thereof) and the Board. Base Salary shall not be
reduced after any increase thereof.

                           (b) EQUITY GRANTS.

                  (1) SHARES. Effective as of the Execution Date, the Executive
is hereby granted, without cost to the Executive, 300,000 shares (the "Shares")
of the

                                        3

<PAGE>

Company's Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth herein. Such
shares shall be fully vested upon the Execution Date. All such Shares, shall be
the sole property of the Executive, shall be unrestricted and shall be freely
tradeable by the Executive, subject to applicable legal restrictions. Within six
(6) months after the Effective Date, the Company shall cause all such Shares to
be registered or qualified for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 and
applicable state laws. The Company shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up
basis with respect to any tax assessed upon him upon the grant of the Shares.

                  (i) RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. The Executive shall have all the
         rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares, including the right
         to receive dividends or other distributions and the right to vote such
         Shares.

                  (ii) DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES. Upon the grant of the
         Shares, the certificates evidencing such Shares shall be delivered
         promptly to the Executive. In the case of Executive's death, such
         certificates will be delivered to the beneficiary designated in writing
         by the Executive pursuant to a form of designation provided by the
         Company, to the Executive's legatee or legatees, or to his personal
         representatives or distributees, as the case may be. Unless and until
         registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, certificates
         evidencing the Shares and shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of
         the Option (as defined in Section 5(b)(2) below) shall bear the
         following legend:

                  THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE SOLD,
                  TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
                  UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
                  AMENDED, OR UNLESS, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY,
                  SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

                  (2) STOCK OPTION. Effective as of the Effective Date, subject
to shareholder approval by Company's shareholders at the annual meeting to be
held on May 12, 1998 (or on such other date on which such meeting will be held)
(the "Annual Meeting"), the Executive is hereby granted a non-qualified stock
option (the "Option") to purchase 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option
Award"). The Option Award is subject to the following conditions: (i) the
exercise price per share of Common Stock shall be $36.85 per share, which is the
average of the high and low selling price per share on the NYSE on January 30,

                                        4

<PAGE>

1998, (ii) the Option Award shall vest and become exercisable with respect to
one-third (1/3) of the shares of Common Stock subject to such award on the
Effective Date and, an additional one-third (1/3) of the shares of Common Stock
subject to such award, on each of the first and second anniversaries of the
Effective Date (subject to earlier vesting provisions set forth in Section
5(b)(3) and earlier vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in Section 7),
and (iii) the Option Award shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the
Effective Date, subject to earlier termination as provided herein. Within six
(6) months after the Effective Date, the Company shall cause all shares subject
to the Option to be registered or qualified for resale under the Securities Act
of 1933 and applicable state laws.

                  In the event that Company's shareholders fail to approve the
grant of the Option at the Annual Meeting, the Company and the Executive shall
negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable alternative compensation
arrangement; provided, however, that the Executive, in his sole discretion, may
elect to terminate this Agreement, in which event it shall be deemed to have
been terminated pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof and the Executive shall be
entitled to receive the compensation, rights and benefits provided in Section
7(e) hereof (other than in respect of stock options).

                  (3) SPECIAL VESTING OF EQUITY GRANTS. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if a Change in Control occurs during the Employment
Period and the Executive has remained continually employed by the Company from
the Effective Date to the date of the Change in Control, the Option Award, to
the extent not theretofore vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable upon the occurrence of such Change in Control. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of any one of the
following events:

                  (A)      any "person" as such term is used in Sections 3(a)(9)
                           and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                           amended, becomes a "beneficial owner," as such term
                           is used in Rule 3d-3 promulgated under that act, of
                           25% or more of the voting stock of the company (other
                           than a person that is currently the beneficial owner
                           of such percentage of the Company's voting stock);

                  (B)      the majority of the Board consists of individuals
                           other than Incumbent Directors, which term means the
                           members of the Board on the date of this Agreement,
                           the Executive and the

                                        5

<PAGE>

                           individuals designated as directors by the Executive
                           in accordance with Section 3 hereof; provided that
                           any person becoming a director subsequent to such
                           date whose election or nomination for election was
                           supported by two-thirds of the directors who then
                           comprised the Incumbent Directors shall be considered
                           to be an Incumbent Director;

                  (C)      the Company, without the Executive's consent, adopts
                           any plan of liquidation providing for the
                           distribution of all or substantially all of its
                           assets; or

                  (D)      all or substantially all of the assets or business of
                           the Company are disposed of pursuant to a merger,
                           consolidation or other transaction (unless the
                           shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such
                           merger, consolidation or other transaction
                           beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in
                           substantially the same proportion as they owned the
                           voting stock of the Company, all of the voting stock
                           or other ownership interests of the entity or
                           entities, if any, that succeed to the business of the
                           Company).

                           (c) EXPENSES. During the Employment Period, the
Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable business expenses in
accordance with applicable policies and procedures then in force, including,
without limitation, first class travel, lodging and other expenses incurred by
him. In light of the fact that the Executive may be required to travel for
extended period of time, such expenses shall include all reasonable expenses of
the Executive's wife for travel with the Executive in the service of the
Company.

                           (d) VACATION AND OTHER ABSENCES. The Executive shall
be entitled to paid vacation and other paid absences, whether for holidays,
illness, personal time or any similar purposes, during the Employment Period in
accordance with policies applicable generally to senior executives of the
Company; provided, however, that the Executive shall always be entitled to at
least six weeks of paid vacation in each calendar year and pro rata for part of
a year and shall be compensated at the conclusion of each calendar year for any
unused vacation days.

                           (e) AUTOMOBILE. Within 90 days immediately following
the Effective Date, the Company shall replace with a comparable vehicle the
Mercedes automobile currently owned by the Company and provided to the

                                        6

<PAGE>

Executive for his exclusive use, and shall provide to the Executive, every two
years thereafter, during the Employment Period, a new automobile, comparable in
type and style, for his exclusive use. The Company shall reimburse the Executive
for all reasonable expenses incurred in the use and maintenance of such
automobile, and will also provide the Executive with a driver on a full-time
basis for security and safety reasons. The Company shall reimburse the Executive
on a grossed up basis in the event that any tax is assessed upon him in relation
to such driver or expenses.

                           (f) CLUB MEMBERSHIP. During the Employment Period,
the Company shall pay any and all initiation fees, monthly membership dues, and
Company-related expenses in connection with the continuation of the Executive's
current country club membership and for comparable country club membership in
the event of a relocation of the Company's principal executive office. The
Company shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis in the event that
any tax is assessed upon him in relation to such fees, dues and expenses.

                           (g) FINANCIAL PLANNING, ETC. During the Employment
Period, the Company shall provide the Executive with financial consulting
services, including tax-related advice and services, without cost or expense to
him and shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis in the event that
any tax is assessed upon him in relation to such services. The Company shall pay
the reasonable fees and disbursements of legal, accounting and tax advisors
incurred by the Executive in connection with the negotiation, preparation and
implementation of this Agreement and any additional instruments and agreements
related hereto, and any transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall
reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis in the event that any tax is
assessed upon him in relation to any such fees and disbursements.

                           (h) OTHER BENEFITS. During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall be eligible to participate at no cost or expense to him in
welfare plans and programs (including any tax-deferred savings plan, group life
insurance plan, medical and dental insurance plan, and accident and disability
insurance plan) ("Benefit Plans") applicable generally to employees and/or
senior executives of the Company, but shall not be eligible to participate in
the Company's short-term or long-term incentive plans or in the Company's
employee defined benefit pension plans.

                  6. TERMINATION. The Executive's employment hereunder, as the
case may be, may be terminated as follows:

                                        7

<PAGE>

                           (a) DEATH. The Executive's employment shall terminate
upon his death, and the date of his death shall be the Date of Termination.

                           (b) DISABILITY. If, as a result of the Executive's
incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been
absent from his duties hereunder on a full-time basis for one hundred and twenty
(120) consecutive days and, within thirty (30) days after written Notice of
Termination (as defined in Section 6(f) hereof) is given, shall not have
returned to the performance of his duties hereunder on a full-time basis
("Disability"), the Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder.
In this event, the Date of Termination shall be thirty (30) days after Notice of
Termination is given (provided that the Executive shall not have returned to the
performance of his duties on a full-time basis during such thirty (30) day
period).

                           (c) CAUSE. The Company may terminate the Executive's
employment hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company
shall have "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder:

                                    (i) upon the Executive's conviction for the
         commission of a felony (or a plea of nolo contendere thereto); or

                                    (ii) willful failure by the Executive
         substantially to perform his duties hereunder (other than any such
         failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to Disability).

                           For purposes hereof, no act or failure to act by the
         Executive shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be
         done by him not in good faith or without reasonable belief that his
         action or omission was in the best interests of the Company or contrary
         to a formal resolution of the Board. Cause shall not exist unless and
         until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
         resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than two
         thirds of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
         held for the purpose (after ten (10) days' prior notice to the
         Executive of such meeting and the purpose thereof and an opportunity
         for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board at
         such meeting), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the
         Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (ii) of this
         Section 6(c) and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. The Date
         of Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of
         Termination; provided, however, that, in the case of a termination for
         Cause under

                                        8

<PAGE>

         clause (ii) above, the Date of Termination shall not be earlier than 30
         days after delivery of the Notice of Termination. Anything herein to
         the contrary notwithstanding, if, following a termination of the
         Executive's employment by the Company for Cause based upon the
         conviction of the Executive for a felony, such conviction is overturned
         in a final determination on appeal, the Executive shall be entitled to
         the payments and the economic equivalent of the benefits the Executive
         would have received if his employment had been terminated by the
         Company without Cause.

                           (d) GOOD REASON. The Executive may terminate his
employment hereunder for Good Reason, provided that the Executive shall have
delivered a Notice of Termination (as defined in Section 6(f) hereof) within
ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the event of Good Reason giving rise to
such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the
occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances, without the
Executive's express written consent, which are not remedied by the Company
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Executive's Notice of Termination:

                                    (i) an assignment to the Executive of any

<PAGE>

                                    (vi) the failure of the Company to continue
         in effect any Benefit Plan that was in effect on the date hereof or
         provide the Execu tive with equivalent benefits;

                                    (vii) the failure of the Company to continue

         times for so long as he shall serve as Chief Executive Officer of the
         Company;

                                    (viii) the failure of the Company to cause
         three individuals (or their successors) designated by the Executive to
         be elected and reelected as directors of the Company in accordance with
         Section 3 hereof;

                                    (ix) any other material breach by the
         Company of this Agreement; or

                                    (x) a Change in Control.

                  In the event of a termination for Good Reason, the Date of
Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which
shall be no more than thirty (30) days after the Notice of Termination.

                           (e) OTHER TERMINATIONS. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder at any
time and the Executive may terminate his employment at any time, in each case
subject to the provisions of Sections 7(d) and (e) hereof. If the Executive's
employment is terminated hereunder for any reason other than as set forth in
Sections 6(a) through 6(d) hereof, the date on which a Notice of Termination is
given or any later date (within 30 days) set forth in such Notice of Termination
shall be the Date of Termination.

                           (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any termination of the
Executive's employment hereunder by the Company or by the Executive (other than
termination pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof) shall be communicated by written
Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 13
hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated. If any dispute concerning a Notice of Termination of

                                       10

<PAGE>

the Executive's employment under Section 6(b), 6(c) or 6(d) hereof results in a
determination that a proper basis for such termination did not exist under such
section, the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be treated, with
respect to a Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 6(b) or 6(c) hereof, as
having been terminated pursuant to Section 6(e) hereof or, with respect to a
Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof, as having not been
terminated.

                  7. COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION OR DURING DISABILITY.

                           (a) DISABILITY PERIOD. During any period during the
Employment Period that the Executive fails to perform his duties hereunder as a
result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness ("Disability Period"),
the Executive shall continue to (i) receive his full Base Salary and (ii)
participate in the Benefit Plans. Such payments made to the Executive during the
Disability Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to
the Executive at or prior to the time of any such payment under disability
benefit plans of the Company or under the Social Security disability insurance
program, and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any such
payment.

                           (b) DEATH. If the Executive's employment hereunder is
terminated as a result of death, then:

                                    (i) the Company shall pay the Executive's
         estate or designated beneficiary, as soon as practicable after the Date
         of Termination, any Base Salary installments due in the month of death
         and any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder
         as of the Date of Termination;

                                    (ii) the Options granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award shall become vested and exercisable, as of
         the Date of Termination, to the extent such Option Award would have
         otherwise become vested on or before the first anniversary of the Date
         of Termination, and all vested Options, as well as all stock options
         granted pursuant to the Prior Agreement ("Prior Agreement Options"),
         shall remain exercisable for a period of one year following such Date
         of Termination and shall thereafter be completely forfeited and
         cancelled; any Options that would not have become vested and
         exercisable on or before the first anniversary of the Date of
         Termination shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Date of
         Termination.

                                       11

<PAGE>

                           (c) DISABILITY. If the Executive's employment
hereunder is terminated as a result of Disability, then:

                                    (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination; and

                                    (ii) the Options granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award shall become vested and exercisable, as of
         the Date of Termination, to the extent such Option Award would have
         otherwise become vested on or before the first anniversary of the Date
         of Termination, and all vested Options, as well as all Prior Agreement
         Options, shall remain exercisable for a period of three years following
         the Date of Termination, and shall thereafter be completely forfeited
         and cancelled; any Options that would not have become vested and
         exercisable on or before the first anniversary of the Date of
         Termination shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Date of
         Termination.

                           (d) CAUSE OR BY EXECUTIVE OTHER THAN FOR GOOD REASON.
If the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated by the Company for Cause
or by the Executive (other than for Good Reason), then:

                                    (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination; and

                                    (ii) in the event of termination by the
         Company for Cause, the Executive shall have the right to exercise the
         vested unexercised portion of the Option Award, as well as all Prior
         Agreement Options, for a period of ninety (90) days after the Date of
         Termination, and any options not so exercised shall be forfeited
         thereafter. In the event of termination by the Executive other than for
         Good Reason, the Executive shall have the right to exercise the vested
         unexercised portion of the Option Award, as well as all Prior Agreement
         Options, for a period of one year following the Date of Termination and
         any options not so exercised shall be forfeited thereafter.

                                       12

<PAGE>

                           (e)  TERMINATION BY COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THE
EXECUTIVE WITH GOOD REASON. If the Executive's employment hereunder is
terminated by the Company (other than for Cause or Disability) or by the
Executive for Good Reason, then:

                                    (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination;

                                    (ii) the Company shall immediately pay to
         the Executive as liquidated damages and not as a penalty a lump sum
         amount equal to the total Base Salary that would have otherwise been
         payable to the Executive with respect to the period commencing
         immediately following the Date of Termination and ending on January 31,
         2001, or, if applicable, the expiration of the Renewal Period (the
         "Salary Continuation Period") at the annualized rate in effect at the
         time Notice of Termination is given;

                                    (iii) the Options granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award shall become fully vested and exercisable
         as of the Date of Termination. The Option Award, as well as each Prior
         Agreement Option, shall remain exercisable for the balance of its
         original 10-year term; and

                                    (iv) for a period of three years immediately
         following the Date of Termination, the Executive shall continue to
         participate in all employee benefit plans and programs in which the
         Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of
         Termination in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs as
         in effect from time to time; provided that the Executive's continued
         participation is permitted under the general terms and provisions of
         such plans and programs. In the event that the Executive's
         participation in any such plan or program is barred, the Company shall
         arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents with benefits
         substantially the same as those which the Executive and his dependents
         would otherwise have been entitled to receive under such plans and
         programs from which their continued participation is barred or provide
         their economic equivalent.

                  8. GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive
receives any payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or

                                       13

<PAGE>

benefits pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement) (a "Payment") that is subject
to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive,
as soon thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment")
such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any
Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax
and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment.
The determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or
benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment
shall be made by an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by the
Company and the Executive and paid by the Company. If the Executive and the
Company cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and
the Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and
those two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm
to serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of
determining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other
payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection
with a Change in Control or the Executive's termination of employment (whether
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or
agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in
Control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be
treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of
tax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole
or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject
to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
tax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the
Gross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest
marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence
on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the
event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount
used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the
case may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax
or such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.

                  9. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7 hereof by seeking other employment or

                                       14

<PAGE>

otherwise, nor shall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a)
any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or
(b) any claims the Company may have against the Executive.

                  10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS,
NON-COMPETITION.

                           (a) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Executive shall
hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries
(the "Sunbeam Entities") all trade secrets, confidential information, and
knowledge or data relating to the Sunbeam Entities and the businesses and
investments of the Sunbeam Entities, which shall have been obtained by the
Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company, including such
information with respect to any products, improvements, formulas, designs or
styles, processes, services, customers, suppliers, marketing techniques,
methods, future plans or operating practices ("Confidential Information");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Confidential Information shall not include any
information known generally to the public (other than as a result of
unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or any specific information or type of
information generally not considered confidential by persons engaged in the same
business as the Company, or information disclosed by the Company or any officer
thereof to a third party without restrictions on the disclosure of such
information. Except as may be required or appropriate in connection with his
carrying out his duties under this Agreement, the Executive shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law
or legal process, communicate or divulge any such Confidential Information to
anyone other than the Company and those designated by the Company.

                           (b) REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS. All records, files,
drawings, documents, models, and the like relating to the business of the
Sunbeam Entities, which the Executive prepares, uses or comes into contact with
and which contain Confidential Information shall not be removed by the Executive
from the premises of any Sunbeam Entity (without the written consent of the
Company) during or after the Employment Period unless such removal shall be
required or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under
this Agreement, and, if so removed by the Executive, shall be returned to such
Sunbeam Entity immediately upon termination of the Executive's employment
hereunder.

                           (c) NON-COMPETITION. During (i) the Executive's
employment with the Company and (ii) the two (2) year period immediately
following

                                       15

<PAGE>

the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive (A) shall not engage,
anywhere within the geographical areas in which any Sunbeam Entity is then
conducting its business operations, directly or indirectly, alone, in
association with or as a shareholder, principal, agent, partner, officer,
director, employee or consultant of any other organization, in any business (a
"Competitive Business") which competes with any business then being conducted by
such Sunbeam Entity; (B) shall not solicit or encourage any officer, employee or
consultant of any of the Sunbeam Entities to leave the employ of any of the
Sunbeam Entities for employment by or with any Competitive Business; and (C)
shall not solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away,
the business or patronage of any of the customers or accounts, or prospective
customers or accounts, of any Sunbeam Entity, which were contacted, solicited or
served by the Executive while employed by the Company; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from owning a maximum of two percent
(2%) of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation. Following the
Date of Termination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent
(5%) of any publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof.
If, at any time, the provisions of this Section 10(c) shall be determined to be
invalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area,
duration or scope of activity, this Section 10(c) shall be considered divisible
and shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and
scope of activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the
court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive
agrees that this Section 10(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as
though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. For
purposes of this Section 10(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor
barbecue grills and small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a
Competitive Business; provided, however, that the gross revenues derived from
sales of such products by such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10%
of its total revenues and (ii) $500,000,000.

                           (d) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach or threatened
breach of this Section 10, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to apply for injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction
to remedy any such breach or threatened breach, the Executive acknowledging that
damages would be inadequate and insufficient.

                           (e) CONTINUING OPERATION. Any termination of the
Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the
continuing operation of this Section 10.

                                       16

<PAGE>

                  11. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Executive
to the full extent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all
expenses, costs, liabilities and legal fees which the Executive may incur in the
discharge of all his duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the right
to be paid in advance by the Company for his expenses in defending a civil or
criminal action, proceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition
thereof. The Executive shall be insured under the Company's Directors' and
Officers' Liability Insurance Policy as in effect from time to time.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
termination of the Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no
effect on the continuing operation of this Section 11.

                  12.  SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

                           (a) COMPANY'S SUCCESSORS. No rights or obligations of
the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company
except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant
to a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity,
or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor
to all or substan tially all of the business and/or assets of the Company and
such assignee or transferee assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of
the Company, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter
of law. The Company will require any such successor to expressly assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. As used in this Agreement (except in the definition of Change in
Control), "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers
the agreement provided for in this Section 12 or which otherwise becomes bound
by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement or by operation of law.

                           (b) EXECUTIVE'S SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall not
be assignable by the Executive. This Agreement and all rights of the Executive
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees. Upon the Executive's death, all amounts to
which he is entitled hereunder, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee,
legatee, or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executive's
estate.

                                     RECITALS

        WHEREAS, the Executive is a party to the Employment Agreement with the
Company dated as of July 22, 1996 (the "Prior Agreement"):

        WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to employ the Executive and the
Executive desires to continue to furnish services to the Company on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth;

        WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement setting forth

hereinafter set forth.

2. EMPLOYMENT PERIOD. The period of employment of the Executive by the Company
hereunder (the "Employment Period") shall commence as of the Effective Date and
shall end on January 31, 2001 (or the Date of Termination (as defined in Section
10 below), if earlier). All options awards granted pursuant to the Prior
Agreement shall vest and become exercisable in full as of the Execution Date. In
addition, 40% of the restricted stock granted pursuant to the Prior Agreement

Executive on a grossed up basis for any federal income tax assessed upon him
upon the vesting of such restricted stock.

3. POSITION AND DUTIES. The Executive shall serve as Vice Chairman of the
Company and as Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, and shall
have such responsibilities, duties and authority as are consistent with such
position and such other duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by
the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive agrees to devote substantially all
his working time, attention and energies to the performance of his duties for
the Company. The Company shall nominate the Executive as a director of the
Company and shall use its best efforts to have the Executive elected and
reelected to the Board for the duration of the Employment Period.

4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The principal place of employment of the Executive
shall be at the Company's principal executive offices in either Broward or Palm
Beach County, Florida, or such other location as may be agreed to by the Board.
In the event that the Company's principal executive offices are moved from
Broward or Palm Beach County Florida, the Company shall promptly pay, or
reimburse the Executive for, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive
relating to any change of the Executive's residence from Broward or Palm Beach
County, Florida, in connection with his employment hereunder, including, without

incurred by him in connection with each and every additional change, if any, in

that any tax is assessed upon him in relation to any such costs or expenses.

of his duties hereunder, during the Employment Period the Company shall pay the
Executive a base salary at an annual rate of $875,000, which rate shall be
retroactive to the Effective Date (the "Base Salary"). Except for the adjustment
necessary to implement the retroactive increase in Base Salary described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Base Salary shall be payable in
substantially equal semi-monthly installments. It is agreed that there shall be
no increase or decrease in the Base Salary during the Employment Period. The
parties agree that the Executive shall not be entitled to participate in any

         (b) EQUITY AND STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

             (i) RESTRICTED SHARES. Effective as of the Effective Date, the
         Executive has been granted, without cost to the Executive, 150,000
         shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in the Company's Stock Option
         Plan) (herein referred to as the "Restricted Shares"). The Restricted
         Shares are granted upon the terms and conditions as set forth in the
         Option Plan, except that twenty-five percent of such Restricted Shares
         shall be vested and unrestricted as of the Execution Date, and an
         additional twenty-five percent of such Restricted Shares shall vest and
         cease to be restricted on each of the first, second and third
         anniversaries of the Effective Date (subject to earlier vesting
         provisions set forth in Section 11) provided that the Executive
         continues to be employed pursuant to this Agreement upon such
         anniversary dates and shall be subject to and modified by all other
         terms and provisions of this Agreement, as expressly set forth herein.
         All such Restricted Shares, once vested, shall be the sole property of
         the Executive, shall be unrestricted and shall be freely tradeable by
         the Executive, subject to applicable legal restrictions. The Company
         shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis with respect to any
         tax assessed upon him in connection with the vesting of any such
         Restricted Shares.

               (A) ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES. The Restricted Shares shall be
               registered in the Executive's name, but the certificates
               evidencing the Restricted Shares shall be retained by the Company
               until such shares become vested and the restrictions thereon
               lapse. The period prior to the time that any particular
               Restricted Shares become vested and the restrictions thereon
               lapse is hereinafter referred to as the "Restricted Period" with
               respect to such shares. The Executive shall execute a stock
               power, in blank, with respect to such Restricted Shares and
               deliver the same to the Company.

               (B) RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. Except as provided herein, during
               the Restricted Period, the Executive shall have all the rights of
               a stockholder with respect to Restricted Shares, including the
               right to receive dividends or other distributions and the right
               to vote such shares; provided that, in the discretion of the
               Company any such dividends or other distributions may be retained
               by the Company unless and until the Restricted Shares in respect
               of which such dividends or other distributions were paid shall
               vest.

               (C) NON-TRANSFERABILITY. During the Restricted Period, the
               Executive may not sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber
               or dispose of the Restricted Shares, and any attempted sale,
               transfer, pledge or other encumbrance or

                                        3


<PAGE>



               disposition (whether voluntary or involuntary) in violation of
               this Section 5(b)(i)(C) shall be null and void.

               (D) DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES. Upon the vesting of any
               Restricted Shares, the certificates evidencing such Restricted
               Shares, together with any dividends or other distributions
               retained by the Company pursuant to Section 5(b)(i)(B), shall be
               delivered promptly to the Executive. In the case of Executive's
               death, such certificates, dividends and distributions will be
               delivered to the beneficiary designated in writing by the
               Executive pursuant to a form of designation provided by the
               Company, to the Executive's legatee or legatees, or to his
               personal representatives or distributees, as the case may be.

               (ii) STOCK OPTION. Effective as of the Effective Date, subject to
        shareholder approval by the Company's shareholders at the annual meeting
        to be held on May 12, 1998 (or on such other date on which such meeting
        will be held) (the "Annual Meeting"), the Executive has been granted a
        stock option (the "Option") to purchase 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock
        (the "Option Award"). The Option is subject to the following conditions:
        (i) the exercise price per share of Common Stock shall be $36.85, which
        is the average of the high and low selling price per share on the NYSE
        on January 30, 1998; (ii) the Option Award shall be vested and
        exercisable with respect to twenty-five percent of the shares subject
        thereto as of the Effective Date and shall become vested and exercisable
        with respect to an additional twenty-five percent of the shares subject
        thereto on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the
        Effective Date; and (iii) the Option Award shall expire on the tenth
        anniversary of the Effective Date, subject to earlier termination as
        provided herein.

               In the event that Company's shareholders fail to approve the
        grant of the Option Award at the Annual Meeting, the Company and the
        Executive shall negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable
        alternative compensation arrangement; provided, however, that the
        Executive, in his sole discretion, may elect to terminate this
        Agreement, in which event it shall be deemed to have been terminated
        pursuant to Section 10(d) hereof, and the Executive shall be entitled to
        receive the compensation, rights and benefits provided in Section 11(e)
        hereof (other than in respect of the stock options).

               (iii) REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Within six months after the Effective
        Date, the Company shall cause the Restricted Shares and all shares of
        stock subject to the Option Award to be registered or qualified for
        resale under the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state laws.
        Unless and until registered under the Securities Act of 1933,

                                         4


<PAGE>


        as amended, certificates evidencing the Restricted Shares and shares
        acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall bear the following
        legend:

               THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE SOLD,
               TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
               UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
               OR UNLESS, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH
               REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

6. EXPENSES. During the Employment Period, the Company shall reimburse the
Executive for all reasonable business expenses in accordance with applicable
policies and procedures then in force.

7. VACATION AND OTHER ABSENCES. The Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation
and other paid absences, whether for holidays, illness, personal time or any
similar purposes, during the Employment Period in accordance with policies
applicable generally to senior executives of the Company; provided, however,
that the Executive shall always be entitled to at least six weeks of paid
vacation in each calendar year and pro rata for part of a year. Up to four weeks
per year of unused vacation may be maintained by the Executive on a cumulative
basis and may be subsequently used in any year or if not so used, the Executive
shall be compensated for any unused vacation days upon the termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

8. TAX PLANNING SERVICES. During the Employment Period, the Company shall
provide the Executive with tax-related advice and services without cost or
expense to him and shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis in the
event that any tax is assessed upon him in relation to such services.

9. OTHER BENEFITS. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible
to participate at no cost or expense to him in welfare plans and programs
(including any tax-deferred savings plan, group life insurance plan, medical and
dental insurance plan, and accident and disability insurance plan) ("Benefit
Plans") applicable generally to employees and/or senior executives of the
Company. The Company will waive, or obtain the waiver of, any waiting periods
for eligibility under the Benefit Plans or will provide comparable benefits to
the Executive without cost to him during the waiting period.

10. TERMINATION. The Executive's employment hereunder, as the case may be, may
be terminated as follows:

                                         5


<PAGE>


        (a) DEATH. The Executive's employment shall terminate upon his death,
and the date of his death shall be the Date of Termination.

        (b) DISABILITY. If, as a result of the Executive's incapacity due to
physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been absent from his duties
hereunder on a full-time basis for one hundred and twenty (120) consecutive days
and, within thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination (as defined in
Section 10(g) hereof), shall not have returned to the performance of his duties
hereunder on a full-time basis ("Disability"), the Company may terminate the
Executive's employment hereunder. In this event, the Date of Termination shall
be thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that the
Executive shall not have returned to the performance of his duties on a
full-time basis during such thirty (30) day period).

        (c) CAUSE. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment
hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall have
"Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder:

                      (i) upon the Executive's conviction for the commission of
        a felony (or a plea of nolo contendere thereto); or

                      (ii) willful failure by the Executive substantially to
        perform his duties hereunder (other than any such failure resulting from
        the Executive's incapacity due to Disability).

            For purposes hereof, no act or failure to act by the Executive shall
be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by him not in good
faith or without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best
interests of the Company or contrary to written instructions of the Chief
Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. The Date of Termination shall be
the date specified in the Notice of Termination; provided, however, that, in the
case of a termination for Cause under clause (ii) above, the Date of Termination
shall not be earlier than 30 days after delivery of the Notice of Termination.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, following a termination of
the Executive's employment by the Company for Cause based upon the conviction of
the Executive for a felony, such conviction is overturned in a final
determination on appeal, the Executive shall be entitled to the payments and the
economic equivalent of the benefits the Executive would have received if his
employment had been terminated by the Company without Cause.

        (d) TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON. The Executive may
terminate his employment hereunder for Good Reason, provided that the Executive
shall have delivered a Notice of Termination (as defined in Section 10(g)
hereof) within ninety (90) days after the

                                         6


<PAGE>


occurrence of the event of Good Reason giving rise to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of one or
more of the following circum stances, without the Executive's express written
consent, which are not remedied by the Company within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Executive's Notice of Termination:

                      (i) an assignment to the Executive of any duties
        materially inconsistent with his positions, duties, responsibilities and
        status with the Company or any material limitation of the powers of the
        Executive not consistent with the powers of the Executive contemplated
        by Section 3 hereof; or

                      (ii) any removal of the Executive from, or any failure to
        re-elect the Executive to, the executive officer position specified in
        Section 3 of this Agreement, or, without the Executive's consent,
        failure to re-elect the Executive as a Director of the Company; or

                      (iii) any other material breach by the Company of this
        Agreement.

               In the event of a termination for Good Reason, the Date of
Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which
shall be no more than thirty (30) days after the Notice of Termination.

        (e) OTHER TERMINATIONS. The Company may terminate the Executive's
employment hereunder at any time, subject to the provisions of Section 11(e)
hereof. The Executive may terminate his employment at any time, subject to the
provisions of Section 11(d) hereof. If the Executive's employment is terminated
hereunder for any reason other than as set forth in Sections 10(a) through 10(d)
hereof, the date on which a Notice of Termination is given or any later date
(within 30 days) set forth in such Notice of Termination shall be the Date of
Termination.

        (f) TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL. Upon a Change
in Control (as defined below), the Executive shall have the right, upon delivery
to the Company of a Notice of Termination (which shall specify a Date of
Termination not less than 30 days after such Notice of Termination), to
terminate his employment under this Agreement and to receive the payments
provided pursuant to Section 11(f) below. If the Executive shall elect to
terminate his employment with the Company other than upon a Change in Control,
he shall receive only the compensation referred to in Section 11(d) below. For
purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of any
one of the following events:

                                         7


<PAGE>



                      (i) any "person" as such term is used in Sections 3(a)(9)
        and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, becomes a
        "beneficial owner,'" as such term is used in Rule 3d-3 promulgated under
        that Act, of 25% or more of the voting stock of the Company (other than
        a person that is currently the beneficial owner of such percentage of
        the Company's voting stock);

                      (ii) the majority of the Board consists of individuals
        other than Incumbent Directors, which term means the members of the
        Board on the date of this Agreement, the Executive and the individuals
        designated as directors by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company;
        provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to such date
        whose election or nomination for election was supported by two-thirds of
        the directors who then comprised the Incumbent Directors shall be
        considered to be an Incumbent Director;

                      (iii) the Company, without the Executive's consent, adopts
        any plan of liquidation providing for the distribution of all or
        substantially all of its assets; or

                      (iv) all or substantially all of the assets or business of
        the Company are disposed of pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
        transaction (unless the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to
        such merger, consolidation or other transaction beneficially own,
        directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they
        owned the voting stock of the Company, all of the voting stock or other
        ownership interests of the entity or entities, if any, that succeed to
        the business of the Company).

        (g) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any termination of the Executive's employment
hereunder by the Company or by the Executive (other than termination pursuant to
Section 10(a) hereof) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to
the other party hereto in accordance with Section 17 hereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which shall
indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and
shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the
provision so indicated. If any dispute concerning a Notice of Termination of the
Executive's employment under Section 10(b), 10(c) or 10(d) hereof results in a
determination that a proper basis for such termination did not exist under such
section, the Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be treated, with
respect to a Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 10(b) or 10(c) hereof, as
having been terminated pursuant to Section 10(e) hereof or, with respect to a
Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 10(d) hereof, as having not been
terminated.

11.     COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION OR DURING DISABILITY.

        (a) DISABILITY PERIOD. During any period during the Employment Period
that the Executive fails to perform his duties hereunder as a result of
incapacity due to physical or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the
Executive shall continue to (i) receive his full Base Salary and (ii)
participate in the Benefit Plans. Such payments made to the Executive during the
Disability Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to
the Executive at or prior to the time of any such payment under disability
benefit plans of the Company or under the Social Security disability insurance
program, and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any such
payment.

        (b) DEATH. If the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated as a
result of death, then:

                      (i) the Company shall pay the Executive's estate or
        designat- ed beneficiary, as soon as practicable after the Date of
        Termination, any Base Salary installments due in the month of death and
        any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder as
        of the Date of Termination;

                      (ii) the Options granted to the Executive pursuant to the
        Option Award (if such Option Award has been approved by the shareholders
        as provided in Section 5(b)(ii)) shall become vested and exercisable, as
        of the Date of Termination, to the extent such Option Award would have
        otherwise become vested on or before the first anniversary of the Date
        of Termination, and all vested Options, as well as all stock options
        granted pursuant to the Prior Agreement ("Prior Agreement Options"),
        shall remain exercisable for a period of one year following such Date of
        Termination and shall thereafter be completely forfeited and cancelled;
        any Options that would not have become vested and exercisable on or
        before the first anniversary of the Date of Termination shall terminate
        and be forfeited as of the Date of Termination; and

                      (iii) the portion of the Restricted Shares that have not
        vested as of the Date of Termination equal to the number of such
        unvested Restricted Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
        which is 36 minus the number of full months remaining in the Employment
        Period (disregarding the earlier termination thereof) after the Date of
        Termination and denominator of which is 36, shall become vested as of
        the Date of Termination and the restrictions imposed thereon shall
        lapse. The balance of such unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited
        to the Company (without further action on the part of the Company or the
        Executive) as of the Date of

                                         9

        Termination, and the Executive shall have no further rights with respect
        to such balance.

        (c) DISABILITY. If the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated as
a result of Disability, then:

                      (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as soon as
        practica ble after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and any
        reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
        services as of the Date of Termination;

                      (ii) the Option granted to the Executive pursuant to the
        Option Award (if such Option Award has been approved by the shareholders
        as provided in Section 5(b)(ii)) shall become vested and exercisable, as
        of the Date of Termination, to the extent such Option Award would have
        otherwise become vested on or before the first anniversary of the Date
        of Termination, and all vested Options, including the Prior Agreement
        Options, shall remain exercisable for a period of three years following
        such Date of Termination and shall thereafter be completely forfeited
        and cancelled; any Options that would not have become vested and
        exercisable on or before the first anniversary of the Date of
        Termination shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Date of
        Termination; and

                      (iii) the portion of the Restricted Shares that have not
        vested as the Date of Termination equal to the number of such unvested
        Restricted Shares multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 36
        minus the number of full months remaining in the Employment Period
        (disregarding the earlier termination thereof) after the Date of
        Termination and denominator of which is 36, shall become vested, and the
        restrictions imposed thereon shall lapse. The balance of such unvested
        Restricted Shares shall be forfeited to the Company (without further
        action on the part of the Company or the Executive) as of the Date of
        Termination, and the Executive shall have no further rights with respect
        to such balance.

        (d) CAUSE OR BY EXECUTIVE OTHER THAN FOR GOOD REASON. If the Executive's
employ ment hereunder is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Executive
other than for Good Reason, then:

                      (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as soon as
        practica ble after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and any
        reimbursable expenses accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
        services as of the Date of Termination; and

                                        10

<PAGE>


                      (ii) the Executive shall immediately forfeit any unvested
        Restricted Shares and any unvested portion of the Option Award. In the
        event of termination by the Company for Cause, the Executive shall have
        the right to exercise the vested unexercised portion of the Option Award
        for a period of ninety (90) days after the Date of Termination, and the
        unexercised portion of such Option Award shall be forfeited thereafter.
        In the event of termination by the Executive other than for Good Reason
        the Executive shall have the right to exercise the vested unexercised
        portion of the Option Award for a period of one year following the Date
        of Termination and the unexercised portion of such Option Award shall be
        forfeited thereafter.

        (e) TERMINATION BY COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THE EXECUTIVE WITH GOOD
REASON. If the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated by the Company
(other than for Cause or Disability) or by the Executive for Good Reason, then:

                      (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as soon as
        practica ble after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and any
        reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
        services as of the Date of Termination;

                      (ii) the Company shall immediately pay to the Executive as
        liquidated damages and not as a penalty a lump sum amount equal to the
        total Base Salary that would have otherwise been payable to the
        Executive with respect to the period commencing immediately following
        the Date of Termination and ending on January 31, 2001, at the
        annualized rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given;

                      (iii) the Option granted to the Executive pursuant to the
        Option Award shall become fully vested and exercisable, and the
        Restricted Shares shall become fully vested, as of the Date of
        Termination. The Option Award, as well as each Prior Agreement Option,
        shall remain exercisable for the balance of its original 10-year term;
        and

                      (iv) the Executive shall continue to participate in all
        employee benefit plans and programs in which the Executive was entitled
        to participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination, in
        accordance with the terms of such plans and programs as in effect from
        time to time, through January 31, 2001; provided that the Executive's
        continued participation is permitted under the general terms and
        provisions of such plans and programs. In the event that the Executive's
        participation in any such plan or program is barred, the Company shall
        arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents with benefits
        substantially the same as those which the Executive and his dependents
        would otherwise have been entitled to receive under such plans and

                                        11

<PAGE>


        programs from which their continued participation is barred or provide
        their economic equivalent.

        (f) TERMINATION UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL. If the Executive shall elect to
terminate his employment under this Agreement upon a Change in Control, the
Company shall pay to the Executive the payments described in Sections 11(e)(i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

12. GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive receives any
payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or benefits
pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a "Payment") that is subject to the
excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive, as soon
thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment") such that
the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise
Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment. The
determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or
benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment
shall be made by an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by the
Company and the Executive and paid by the Company. If the Executive and the
Company cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and
the Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and
those two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm
to serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of
determining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other
payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection
with a Change in Control or the Executive's termination of employment (whether
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or
agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in
Control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be
treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of
tax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole
or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject
to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
tax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the
Gross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest
marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence
on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the
event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount
used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the
case may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax
or such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.

                                        12

<PAGE>


13. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate amounts payable
pursuant to Section 11 hereof by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor
shall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a) any
remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or (b)
any claims the Company may have against the Executive.

14. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS, NON-COMPETITION.

        (a) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Sunbeam
Entities") all trade secrets, confidential information, and knowledge or data
relating to the Sunbeam Entities and the businesses and investments of the
Sunbeam Entities, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company, including such information with respect
to any products, improvements, formulas, designs or styles, processes, services,
customers, suppliers, marketing techniques, methods, future plans or operating
practices ("Confidential Information"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Confidential
Information shall not include any information known generally to the public
(other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or any
specific information or type of information generally not considered
confidential by persons engaged in the same business as the Company, or
information disclosed by the Company or any officer thereof to a third party
without restrictions on the disclosure of such information. Except as may be
required or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under
this Agreement, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate
or divulge any such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company
and those designated by the Company.

        (b) REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS. All records, files, drawings, documents,
models, and the like relating to the business of the Sunbeam Entities, which the
Executive prepares, uses or comes into contact with and which contain
Confidential Information shall not be removed by the Executive from the premises
of any Sunbeam Entity (without the written consent of the Company) during or
after the Employment Period unless such removal shall be required or appropriate
in connection with his carrying out his duties under this Agreement, and, if so
removed by the Executive, shall be returned to such Sunbeam Entity immediately
upon termination of the Executive's employment hereunder.

        (c) NON-COMPETITION. During (i) the Executive's employment with the
Company and (ii) the two (2) year period immediately following the Executive's
Date of Termination, the Executive (A) shall not engage, anywhere within the
geographical areas in which any Sunbeam Entity is then conducting its business
operations, directly or indirectly, alone, in association with or as a
shareholder, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee or

                                       13

<PAGE>


consultant of any other organization, in any business (a "Competitive Business")
which competes with any business then being conducted by such Sunbeam Entity;
(B) shall not solicit or encourage any officer, employee or consultant of any of
the Sunbeam Entities to leave the employ of any of the Sunbeam Entities for
employment by or with any Competitive Business; and (C) shall not solicit,
divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away, the business or
patronage of any of the customers or accounts, or prospective customers or
accounts, of any Sunbeam Entity, which were contacted, solicited or served by
the Executive while employed by the Company; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall prohibit the Executive from owning a maximum of two percent (2%) of
the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation. Following the Date of
Termination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent (5%) of
any publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof. If, at
any time, the provisions of this Section 14(c) shall be determined to be invalid
or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area, duration
or scope of activity, this Section 14(c) shall be considered divisible and shall
become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and scope of
activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or
other body having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive agrees that
this Section 14(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any
invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. For purposes of
this Section 14(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor barbecue
grills and small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a Competitive
Business; provided, however, that the gross revenues derived from sales of such
products by such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10% of its total
revenues and (ii) $500,000,000.

        (d) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this
Section 14, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to apply for
injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to remedy any such
breach or threatened breach, the Executive acknowledging that damages would be
inadequate and insufficient.

        (e) CONTINUING OPERATION. Any termination of the Executive's employment
or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this
Section 14.

15. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the full
extent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all expenses, costs,
liabilities and legal fees which the Executive may incur in the discharge of all
his duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to be paid in
advance by the Company for his expenses in defending a civil or criminal action,
proceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition thereof. The
Executive shall be insured under the Company's Directors' and Officers'
Liability Insurance Policy as in effect from time to time. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any termination of the
Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the
continuing operation of this Section 15.

or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executive's estate.

         Executive, 30,000 shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in the
         Company's Stock Option Plan) (herein referred to as the "Restricted
         Shares"). The Restricted Shares are granted upon the terms and
         conditions as set forth in the Option Plan, except that twenty-five
         percent of such Restricted

                                        2

<PAGE>

         Shares shall be vested and unrestricted as of the Execution Date, and
         an additional twenty-five percent of such Restricted Shares shall vest
         and cease to be restricted on each of the first, second and third
         anniversaries of the Effective Date (subject to earlier vesting
         provisions set forth in Section 11) provided that the Executive
         continues to be employed pursuant to this Agreement upon such
         anniversary dates and shall be subject to and modified by all other
         terms and provisions of this Agreement, as expressly set forth herein.
         All such Restricted Shares, once vested, shall be the sole property of
         the Executive, shall be unrestricted and shall be freely tradeable by
         the Executive, subject to applicable legal restrictions. The Company
         shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis with respect to any
         tax assessed upon him in connection with the vesting of any such
         Restricted Shares.

                 (A) ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES. The Restricted Shares shall be
                 registered in the Executive's name, but the certificates
                 evidencing the Restricted Shares shall be retained by the
                 Company until such shares become vested and the restrictions
                 thereon lapse. The period prior to the time that any particular
                 Restricted Shares become vested and the restrictions thereon
                 lapse is hereinafter referred to as the "Restricted Period"
                 with respect to such shares. The Executive shall execute a
                 stock power, in blank, with respect to such Restricted Shares
                 and deliver the same to the Company.

                 (B) RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. Except as provided herein, during
                 the Restricted Period, the Executive shall have all the rights
                 of a stockholder with respect to Restricted Shares, including
                 the right to receive dividends or other distributions and the
                 right to vote such shares; provided that, in the discretion of
                 the Company any such dividends or other distributions may be
                 retained by the Company unless and until the Restricted Shares
                 in respect of which such dividends or other distributions were
                 paid shall vest.

                 (C) NON-TRANSFERABILITY. During the Restricted Period, the
                 Executive may not sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber
                 or dispose of the Restricted Shares, and any attempted sale,
                 transfer, pledge or other encumbrance or disposition (whether
                 voluntary or involuntary) in violation of this Section
                 5(b)(i)(C) shall be null and void.

                 (D) DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES. Upon the vesting of any
                 Restricted Shares, the certificates evidencing such Restricted
                 Shares, together with any dividends or other distributions
                 retained by the Company pursuant to Section 5(b)(i)(B), shall
                 be delivered promptly to the Executive. In the case of
                 Executive's death, such certificates, dividends and
                 distributions will be delivered to the beneficiary designated
                 in writing by the Executive pursuant to a form of designation
                 provided by the Company, to the Executive's legatee or
                 legatees, or to his personal representatives or distributees,
                 as the case may be.

                                   (ii) STOCK OPTION. Effective as of the
         Effective Date, subject to shareholder approval by the Company's
         shareholders at the annual meeting to be held on May 12, 1998 (or on
         such other date on which such meeting will be held) (the "Annual
         Meeting"), the Executive has been granted a stock option (the "Option")
         to purchase 750,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Award"). The
         Option is subject to the following conditions: (i) the exercise price
         per share of Common Stock shall be $36.85, which is the average of the
         high and low selling price per share on the NYSE on January 30, 1998;
         (ii) the Option Award shall be vested and exercisable with respect to
         twenty-five percent of the shares subject thereto as of the Effective
         Date and shall become vested and exercisable with respect to an
         additional twenty-five percent of the shares subject thereto on each of
         the first, second and third anniversaries of the Effective Date; and
         (iii) the Option Award shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the
         Effective Date, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

                 In the event that Company's shareholders fail to approve the
         grant of the Option Award at the Annual Meeting, the Company and the
         Executive shall negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable
         alternative compensation arrangement; provided, however, that the
         Executive, in his sole discretion, may elect to terminate this
         Agreement, in which event it shall be deemed to have been terminated
         pursuant to Section 10(d) hereof, and the Executive shall be entitled
         to receive the compensation, rights and benefits provided in Section
         11(e) hereof (other than in respect of the stock options).

                                   (iii) REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Within six months
         after the Effective Date, the Company shall cause the Restricted Shares
         and all shares of stock subject to the Option Award to be registered or
         qualified for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable
         state laws. Unless and until registered under the Securities Act of
         1933, as amended, certificates evidencing the Restricted Shares and
         shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall bear the
         following legend:

                 THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE SOLD,
                 TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
                 UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
                 OR UNLESS, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH
                 REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

                 6. EXPENSES. During the Employment Period, the Company shall
reimburse the Executive for all reasonable business expenses in accordance with
applicable policies and procedures then in force.

                 7. VACATION AND OTHER ABSENCES. The Executive shall be entitled
to paid vacation and other paid absences, whether for holidays, illness,
personal time or any similar purposes, during the Employment Period in
accordance with policies applicable generally to senior executives of the
Company; provided, however, that the Executive shall always be

                                        4

<PAGE>

entitled to at least six weeks of paid vacation in each calendar year and pro
rata for part of a year. Up to four weeks per year of unused vacation may be
maintained by the Executive on a cumulative basis and may be subsequently used
in any year or if not so used, the Executive shall be compensated for any unused
vacation days upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

                 8. TAX PLANNING SERVICES. During the Employment Period, the
Company shall provide the Executive with tax-related advice and services without
cost or expense to him and shall reimburse the Executive on a grossed up basis
in the event that any tax is assessed upon him in relation to such services.

                 9. OTHER BENEFITS. During the Employment Period, the Executive
shall be eligible to participate at no cost or expense to him in welfare plans
and programs (including any tax-deferred savings plan, group life insurance
plan, medical and dental insurance plan, and accident and disability insurance
plan) ("Benefit Plans") applicable generally to employees and/or senior
executives of the Company. The Company will waive, or obtain the waiver of, any
waiting periods for eligibility under the Benefit Plans or will provide
comparable benefits to the Executive without cost to him during the waiting
period.

                 10. TERMINATION. The Executive's employment hereunder, as the
case may be, may be terminated as follows:

                          (a) DEATH. The Executive's employment shall terminate
upon his death, and the date of his death shall be the Date of Termination.

                          (b) DISABILITY. If, as a result of the Executive's
incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been
absent from his duties hereunder on a full-time basis for one hundred and twenty
(120) consecutive days and, within thirty (30) days after written Notice of
Termination (as defined in Section 10(g) hereof), shall not have returned to the
performance of his duties hereunder on a full-time basis ("Disability"), the
Company may terminate the Executive's employment hereunder. In this event, the
Date of Termination shall be thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is
given (provided that the Executive shall not have returned to the performance of
his duties on a full-time basis during such thirty (30) day period).

                          (c) CAUSE. The Company may terminate the Executive's
employment hereunder for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, the Company
shall have "Cause" to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder:

                                   (i) upon the Executive's conviction for the
         commission of a felony (or a plea of nolo contendere thereto); or

                                   (ii) willful failure by the Executive
         substantially to perform his duties hereunder (other than any such
         failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to Disability).

                                        5

<PAGE>

                 For purposes hereof, no act or failure to act by the Executive
shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by him not in
good faith or without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the
best interests of the Company or contrary to written instructions of the Chief
Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. The Date of Termination shall be
the date specified in the Notice of Termination; provided, however, that, in the
case of a termination for Cause under clause (ii) above, the Date of Termination
shall not be earlier than 30 days after delivery of the Notice of Termination.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, following a termination of
the Executive's employment by the Company for Cause based upon the conviction of
the Executive for a felony, such conviction is overturned in a final
determination on appeal, the Executive shall be entitled to the payments and the
economic equivalent of the benefits the Executive would have received if his
employment had been terminated by the Company without Cause.

                          (d) TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON. The
Executive may terminate his employment hereunder for Good Reason, provided that
the Executive shall have delivered a Notice of Termination (as defined in
Section 10(g) hereof) within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the event
of Good Reason giving rise to such termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following
circumstances, without the Executive's express written consent, which are not
remedied by the Company within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Executive's
Notice of Termination:

                                   (i) an assignment to the Executive of any
         duties materially inconsistent with his positions, duties,
         responsibilities and status with the Company or any material limitation
         of the powers of the Executive not consistent with the powers of the
         Executive contemplated by Section 3 hereof; or

                                   (ii) any removal of the Executive from, or
         any failure to re-elect the Executive to, the executive officer
         position specified in Section 3 of this Agreement; or

                                   (iii) any other material breach by the
         Company of this Agreement.

                 In the event of a termination for Good Reason, the Date of
Termination shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which
shall be no more than thirty (30) days after the Notice of Termination.

                          (e) OTHER TERMINATIONS. The Company may terminate the
Executive's employment hereunder at any time, subject to the provisions of
Section 11(e) hereof. The Executive may terminate his employment at any time
subject to the provisions of Section 11(d) hereof. If the Executive's employment
is terminated hereunder for any reason other than as set forth in Sections 10(a)
through 10(d) hereof, the date on which a

                                        6

<PAGE>

Notice of Termination is given or any later date (within 30 days) set forth in
such Notice of Termination shall be the Date of Termination.

                          (f) TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE UPON CHANGE IN
CONTROL. Upon a Change in Control (as defined below), the Executive shall have
the right, upon delivery to the Company of a Notice of Termination (which shall
specify a Date of Termination not less than 30 days after such Notice of
Termination), to terminate his employment under this Agreement and to receive
the payments provided pursuant to Section 11(f) below. If the Executive shall
elect to terminate his employment with the Company other than upon a Change in
Control, he shall receive only the compensation referred to in Section 11(d)
below. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean the
occurrence of any one of the following events:

                                   (i) any "person" as such term is used in
         Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
         amended, becomes a "beneficial owner," as such term is used in Rule
         3d-3 promulgated under that Act, of 25% or more of the voting stock of
         the Company (other than a person that is currently the beneficial owner
         of such percentage of the Company's voting stock),

                                   (ii) the majority of the Board consists of
         individuals other than Incumbent Directors, which term means the
         members of the Board on the date of this Agreement and the individuals
         designated as directors by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company;
         provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to such date
         whose election or nomination for election was supported by two-thirds
         of the directors who then comprised the Incumbent Directors shall be
         considered to be an Incumbent Director;

                                   (iii) the Company, without the Executive's
         consent, adopts any plan of liquidation providing for the distribution
         of all or substantially all of its assets; or

                                   (iv) all or substantially all of the assets
         or business of the Company are disposed of pursuant to a merger,
         consolidation or other transaction (unless the shareholders of the
         Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other
         transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially
         the same proportion as they owned the voting stock of the Company, all
         of the voting stock or other ownership interests of the entity or
         entities, if any, that succeed to the business of the Company).

                          (g) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any termination of the
Executive's employment hereunder by the Company or by the Executive (other than
termination pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof) shall be communicated by written
Notice of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 17
hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a
notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and

                                        7

<PAGE>

circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's
employment under the provision so indicated. If any dispute concerning a Notice
of Termination of the Executive's employment under Section 10(b), 10(c) or 10(d)
hereof results in a determination that a proper basis for such termination did
not exist under such section, the Executive's employment under this Agreement
shall be treated, with respect to a Notice of Termination pursuant to Section
10(b) or 10(c) hereof, as having been terminated pursuant to Section 10(e)
hereof or, with respect to a Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 10(d)
hereof, as having not been terminated.

                 11. COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION OR DURING DISABILITY.

                          (a) DISABILITY PERIOD. During any period during the
Employment Period that the Executive fails to perform his duties hereunder as a
result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness ("Disability Period"),
the Executive shall continue to (i) receive his full Base Salary and (ii)
participate in the Benefit Plans. Such payments made to the Executive during the
Disability Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to
the Executive at or prior to the time of any such payment under disability
benefit plans of the Company or under the Social Security disability insurance
program, and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any such
payment.

                          (b) DEATH. If the Executive's employment hereunder is
terminated as a result of death, then:

                                   (i) the Company shall pay the Executive's
         estate or designated beneficiary, as soon as practicable after the Date
         of Termination, any Base Salary installments due in the month of death
         and any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder
         as of the Date of Termination;

                                   (ii) the Options granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award (if such Option Award has been approved by
         the shareholders as provided in Section 5(b)(ii)) shall become vested
         and exercisable, as of the Date of Termination, to the extent such
         Option Award would have otherwise become vested on or before the first
         anniversary of the Date of Termination, and all vested Options, as well
         as all stock options granted pursuant to the Prior Agreement ("Prior
         Agreement Options") shall remain exercisable for a period of one year
         following such Date of Termination and shall thereafter be completely
         forfeited and cancelled; any Options that would not have become vested
         and exercisable on or before the first anniversary of the Date of
         Termination shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Date of
         Termination; and

                                   (iii) the portion of the Restricted Shares
         that have not vested as of the Date of Termination equal to the number
         of such unvested Restricted Shares multiplied by a fraction, the
         numerator of which is 36 minus the number of full months remaining in
         the Employment Period (disregarding the earlier termination thereof)
         after the Date of Termination and denominator of which is 36, shall
         become

                                        8

<PAGE>

         vested as of the Date of Termination and the restrictions imposed
         thereon shall lapse. The balance of such unvested Restricted Shares
         shall be forfeited to the Company (without further action on the part
         of the Company or the Executive) as of the Date of Termination, and the
         Executive shall have no further rights with respect to such balance.

                          (c) DISABILITY. If the Executive's employment
hereunder is terminated as a result of Disability, then:

                                   (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination;

                                   (ii) the Option granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award (if such Option Award has been approved by
         the shareholders as provided in Section 5(b)(ii)) shall become vested
         and exercisable, as of the Date of Termination, to the extent such
         Option Award would have otherwise become vested on or before the first
         anniversary of the Date of Termination, and all vested Options, as well
         as the Prior Agreement Options, shall remain exercisable for a period
         of three years following such Date of Termination and shall thereafter
         be completely forfeited and cancelled; any Options that would not have
         become vested and exercisable on or before the first anniversary of the
         Date of Termination shall terminate and be forfeited as of the Date of
         Termination; and

                                   (iii) the portion of the Restricted Shares
         that have not vested as of the Date of Termination equal to the number
         of such unvested Restricted Shares multiplied by a fraction, the
         numerator of which is 36 minus the number of full months remaining in
         the Employment Period (disregarding the earlier termination thereof)
         after the Date of Termination and denominator of which is 36, shall
         become vested, and the restrictions imposed thereon shall lapse. The
         balance of such unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited to the
         Company (without further action on the part of the Company or the
         Executive) as of the Date of Termination, and the Executive shall have
         no further rights with respect to such balance.

                          (d) CAUSE OR BY EXECUTIVE OTHER THAN FOR GOOD REASON.
If the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated by the Company for Cause
or by the Executive other than for Good Reason, then:

                                   (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination; and

                                   (ii) the Executive shall immediately forfeit
         any unvested Restricted Shares and any unvested portion of the Option
         Award. In the event of

                                        9

<PAGE>

         termination by the Company for Cause, the Executive shall have the
         right to exercise the vested unexercised portion of the Option Award
         for a period of ninety (90) days after the Date of Termination, and the
         unexercised portion of such Option Award shall be forfeited thereafter.
         In the event of termination by the Executive other than for Good Reason
         the Executive shall have the right to exercise the vested unexercised
         portion of the Option Award for a period of one year following the Date
         of Termination and the unexercised portion of such Option Award shall
         be forfeited thereafter.

                          (e) TERMINATION BY COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THE
EXECUTIVE WITH GOOD REASON. If the Executive's employment hereunder is
terminated by the Company (other than for Cause or Disability) or by the
Executive for Good Reason, then:

                                   (i) the Company shall pay the Executive, as
         soon as practicable after the Date of Termination, any Base Salary and
         any reimbursable expenses, accrued or owing the Executive hereunder for
         services as of the Date of Termination;

                                   (ii) the Company shall immediately pay to the
         Executive as liquidated damages and not as a penalty a lump sum amount
         equal to the total Base Salary that would have otherwise been payable
         to the Executive with respect to the period commencing immediately
         following the Date of Termination and ending on January 31, 2001, at
         the annualized rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is
         given;

                                   (iii) the Option granted to the Executive
         pursuant to the Option Award shall become fully vested and exercisable,
         and the Restricted Shares shall become fully vested, as of the Date of
         Termination. The Option Award, as well as each Prior Agreement Option,
         shall remain exercisable for the balance of its original 10-year term;
         and

                                   (iv) the Executive shall continue to
         participate in all employee benefit plans and programs in which the
         Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of
         Termination, in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs as
         in effect from time to time, through January 31, 2001; provided that
         the Executive's continued participation is permitted under the general
         terms and provisions of such plans and programs. In the event that the
         Executive's participation in any such plan or program is barred, the
         Company shall arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents with
         benefits substantially the same as those which the Executive and his
         dependents would otherwise have been entitled to receive under such
         plans and programs from which their continued participation is barred
         or provide their economic equivalent.

                          (f) TERMINATION UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL. If the
Executive shall elect to terminate his employment under this Agreement upon a
Change in Control, the Company shall pay to the Executive the payments described
in Sections 11(e)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

                                       10

                 12. GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive
receives any payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or
benefits pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a "Payment") that is subject
to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive,
as soon thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment")
such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any
Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax
and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment.
The determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or
benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment
shall be made by an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by the
Company and the Executive and paid by the Company. If the Executive and the
Company cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and
the Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and
those two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm
to serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of
determining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other
payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection
with a Change in Control or the Executive's termination of employment (whether
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or
agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in
Control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be
treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 28OG(b)(2) of the
Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 28OG of
the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of
tax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole
or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject
to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income
tax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the
Gross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest
marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence
on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes
which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the
event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount
used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the
case may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax
or such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.

                 13. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate
amounts payable pursuant to Section 11 hereof by seeking other employment or
otherwise, nor shall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a)
any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or
(b) any claims the Company may have against the Executive.

                 14. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS,
NON-COMPETITION.

                          (a) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Executive shall hold
in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
"Sunbeam

                                       11

<PAGE>

Entities") all trade secrets, confidential information, and knowledge or data
relating to the Sunbeam Entities and the businesses and investments of the
Sunbeam Entities, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company, including such information with respect
to any products, improvements, formulas, designs or styles, processes, services,
customers, suppliers, marketing techniques, methods, future plans or operating
practices ("Confidential Information"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Confidential
Information shall not include any information known generally to the public
(other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or any
specific information or type of information generally not considered
confidential by persons engaged in the same business as the Company, or
information disclosed by the Company or any officer thereof to a third party
without restrictions on the disclosure of such information. Except as may be
required or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under
this Agreement, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate
or divulge any such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company
and those designated by the Company.

                          (b) REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS. All records, files,
drawings, documents, models, and the like relating to the business of the
Sunbeam Entities, which the Executive prepares, uses or comes into contact with
and which contain Confidential Information shall not be removed by the Executive
from the premises of any Sunbeam Entity (without the written consent of the
Company) during or after the Employment Period unless such removal shall be
required or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under
this Agreement, and, if so removed by the Executive, shall be returned to such
Sunbeam Entity immediately upon termination of the Executive's employment
hereunder.

                          (c) NON-COMPETITION. During (i) the Executive's
employment with the Company and (ii) the two (2) year period immediately
following the Executive's Date of Termination, the Executive (A) shall not
engage, anywhere within the geographical areas in which any Sunbeam Entity is
then conducting its business operations, directly or indirectly, alone, in
association with or as a shareholder, principal, agent, partner, officer,
director, employee or consultant of any other organization, in any business (a
"Competitive Business") which competes with any business then being conducted by
such Sunbeam Entity; (B) shall not solicit or encourage any officer, employee or
consultant of any of the Sunbeam Entities to leave the employ of any of the
Sunbeam Entities for employment by or with any Competitive Business; and (C)
shall not solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away,
the business or patronage of any of the customers or accounts, or prospective
customers or accounts, of any Sunbeam Entity, which were contacted, solicited or
served by the Executive while employed by the Company; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from owning a maximum of two percent
(2%) of the outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation. Following the
Date of Termination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent
(5%) of any publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof.
If, at any time, the provisions of this Section 14(c) shall be determined to be
invalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area,
duration or scope of activity, this Section 14(c) shall be considered divisible
and shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and
scope of activity as

                                       12

<PAGE>

shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body
having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive agrees that this Section
14(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any invalid or
unenforceable provision had not been included herein. For purposes of this
Section 14(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor barbecue grills
and small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a Competitive Business;
provided, however, that the gross revenues derived from sales of such products
by such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10% of its total revenues
and (ii) $500,000,000.

                          (d) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach or threatened
breach of this Section 14, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to apply for injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction
to remedy any such breach or threatened breach, the Executive acknowledging that
damages would be inadequate and insufficient.

                          (e) CONTINUING OPERATION. Any termination of the
Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the
continuing operation of this Section 14.

                 15. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Executive
to the full extent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all
expenses, costs, liabilities and legal fees which the Executive may incur in the
discharge of all his duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the right
to be paid in advance by the Company for his expenses in defending a civil or
criminal action, proceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition
thereof. The Executive shall be insured under the Company's Directors' and
Officers' Liability Insurance Policy as in effect from time to time.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
termination of the Executive's employment or of this Agreement shall have no
effect on the continuing operation of this Section 15.

                 16. SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

                          (a) COMPANY'S SUCCESSORS. No rights or obligations of
the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company
except that such rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant
to a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the continuing entity,
or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company, provided that the assignee or transferee is the successor
to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company and
such assignee or transferee assumes the liabilities, obligations and duties of
the Company, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter
of law. The Company will require any such successor to expressly assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. As used in this Agreement (except in the definition of Change in
Control), "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and

                                       13

<PAGE>

delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 16 or which otherwise
becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement or by operation
of law.

                          (b) EXECUTIVE'S SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall not
be assignable by the Executive. This Agreement and all rights of the Executive
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees. Upon the Executive's death, all amounts to
which he is entitled hereunder, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee,
legatee, or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executive's
estate.

                 17. NOTICE. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices,
demands and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or (unless
otherwise specified) mailed by United States certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing
in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

                 18. MISCELLANEOUS. No provisions of this Agreement may be
modified unless such modification is agreed to in writing signed by the
Executive and an authorized officer of the Company. Any waiver or discharge must
be in writing and signed by the Executive or such an authorized officer of the
Company, as the case may be. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any
prior or subsequent time. The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this

Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard

state or local law.

                 20. ARBITRATION.

                          (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all
controversies, claims or disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement
shall be settled under the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in
effect in the State of Florida, as the sole and exclusive remedy of either
party, and judgment upon such award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration shall be
borne as determined by the arbitrators PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company's
position is not substantially upheld, as determined by the arbitrators, the
expenses of the Executive (including, without limitation, fees and expenses
payable to the AAA and the arbitrators, fees and expenses payable to witnesses,
including expert witnesses, fees and expenses payable to attorneys and other
professionals, expenses of the Executive in attending the hearings, costs in
connection with obtaining and presenting evidence and costs of transcription of
the proceedings), as determined by the arbitrators, shall be reimbursed to him
by the Company.

                          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20(a)
above, the parties agree that nothing contained herein shall preclude the
Company from bringing an action in a court of competent jurisdiction (whether
prior to or during any arbitration proceeding) seeking to specifically enforce
the provisions of Section 14 hereof by means of seeking an injunction or other
equitable relief.

                 21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and the
terms of the Option Plan set forth the entire agreement of the parties hereto in
respect of the subject matter contained herein, supersede all prior agreements,
promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or
warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative
of any party hereto; and any prior agreement of the parties hereto or thereto in
respect of the subject matter contained herein or therein, including but not
limited to the Prior Agreement, is hereby terminated and cancelled. This
Agreement may be signed in counterparts.

             SUNBEAM CORPORATION EXECUTIVE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PLAN

              (As Amended and Restated Effective December 15, 1994)

                                    SECTION 1

                                  INTRODUCTION

1.1. THE PLAN, THE COMPANY. SUNBEAM CORPORATION (formerly known as Sunbeam-Oster
Company, Inc.) (the "Company") established the Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. Execu
tive Benefit Retirement Plan effective as of December 15, 1994, and hereby
adopts the amendment and restatement of the plan, now known as SUNBEAM
CORPORATION EXEC UTIVE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PLAN (the "Plan"). The Plan as set
forth herein is effec tive December 15, 1994 (the "Effective Date"), except as
otherwise specifically provided.

1.2. EMPLOYERS. The Company and each other organization that is an employer
under SUN BEAM CORPORATION 401(k) SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN (the "401(k)
Plan") shall be an "Employer" under this Plan unless specified to the contrary
by the Company by writing filed with the Committee described in subsection 1.4.

1.3. PURPOSE. The Company and certain related businesses maintain and are
employers under the 401(k) Plan, which is intended to meet the requirements of a
"qualified plan" under Sec tion 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose
of this Plan, a nonqualified plan, is generally to provide for eligible
employees benefits that such employees do not earn under the 401(k) Plan because
such employees do not participate in the 401(k) Plan.

The Plan generally will allow Participants to elect to "make" before-tax
contributions to the Plan in the same amount and same manner as under the terms
of the 401(k) Plan; the Employ ers will provide "matching contributions" based
on a Participant's before-tax contributions; lastly, the Employers will



<PAGE>


provide "profit sharing contributions" allocated based on each Participant's
Compensation for a year. This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for
the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management
or highly-compensated employees, as such plans are described in Sections 201(2),
301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
"Contributions" to the Plan are reflected through credits to bookkeeping
accounts that are adjusted periodically to reflect hypothetical investment
earnings. Participants are entitled to receive from the general assets of the
Employers cash payments equal to the vested portion of their account balances,
as set forth in the Plan.

1.4. PLAN ADMINISTRATION. The Plan is administered by the administrative
committee (the "Committee") that is responsible for administration of the 401(k)
Plan. To the extent appropriate, the Committee has the same powers, rights,
duties and obligations as are vested in the committee responsible for
administration of the 401(k) Plan.

1.5. COMPENSATION. For purposes of computing contributions and benefits under
the Plan, an employee's "Compensation" shall mean his compensation as defined
from time to time in Section 1.14 of the 401(k) Plan, determined, however,
without regard to any limits under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

                                    SECTION 2

                          ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION

2.1. COVERED EMPLOYEE. A "Covered Employee" means an employee of an Employer
under the Plan who is selected by the Company's board of directors or by a
person or committee authorized to act on behalf of the board of directors. An
employee who is selected shall con tinue as a Covered Employee until he
terminates employment with all Employers or until he is removed as a Covered
Employee by the Company's board of directors or by the

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

person or committee authorized to act on its behalf effective as of the end of a
calendar year, whichever occurs first.

2.2. ELIGIBILITY. Subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan, an
employee of an Em ployer shall become eligible to enroll in this Plan and shall
become a "Participant" on the first date occurring on or after the Effective
Date on which he is a Covered Employee.

2.3. PERIOD OF PARTICIPATION. An employee of an Employer who becomes a
Participant in this Plan will continue as a Participant in the Plan in
accordance with its provisions until all bene fits to which he is entitled under
the Plan have been distributed to him.

                                    SECTION 3

                                    BENEFITS

3.1. INTENT. Commencing on the Effective Date, the provisions of this Section 3
are intended to allow a Participant to elect to make before-tax contributions,
to earn "matching contribu tions" that are at the same rate as those made by his
Employer on behalf of 401(k) Plan Partic ipants, and to earn "profit sharing
contributions" at the same rate as those made on behalf of participants under
the 401(k) Plan.

3.2. BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS.

         (a)      For 1994, a Participant may elect to make Before-Tax
                  Contributions of any or all of his Compensation attributable
                  to services performed after the Effective Date (but not more
                  than $9,240). Beginning January 1, 1995, a Participant may
                  elect to make Before-Tax Contributions in whole multiples of
                  his Compensation from 1% to 10%, but not in excess of the
                  amount by which Before-Tax Contributions are limited in the

                                      -3-

<PAGE>


                  401(k) Plan because of Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue
                  Code. A Participant's Before-Tax Contributions under this
                  subsection 3.2 shall be made pursuant to a compensation
                  deferral election by which the Participant elects to have his
                  Compensation reduced by the amount provided in the election,
                  and the Employer shall credit such amount to the Participant's
                  account as provided in subsection 3.6.

         (b)      An election shall be filed with the Participant's Employer
                  prior to the calendar year such contributions are to begin,
                  or, for contributions to be made in 1994, within ten days of
                  the Effective Date. If a Participant first becomes eligible to
                  make such contributions after the Effective Date and during,
                  but after the beginning of, any subsequent calendar year, such
                  Participant's deferral election must be filed with his Em
                  ployer not more than 30 days after so becoming eligible.

         (c)      A Participant's compensation deferral election under this
                  subsection 3.2 shall apply to Compensation otherwise payable
                  after the later to occur of the date the Participant becomes
                  eligible to make Before-Tax Contri butions and the date the
                  election is filed with his Employer. A Partici pant's
                  compensation deferral election, however, may be revoked by the
                  Participant before the beginning of any subsequent calendar
                  year. The revocation shall be effective as to Compensation the
                  Participant is enti tled to receive during that and subsequent
                  calendar years unless prior to the commencement of any
                  subsequent calendar year the Participant makes another
                  compensation deferral election. Such later election shall
                  apply as to Compensation otherwise payable during calendar
                  years beginning after such later election is made.

         (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's compensation
                  deferral election automatically

                  shall be revoked for any period he ceases, in the sole opinion
                  of the Committee, to be a member of a select group of
                  management or a highly-compensated employee.

3.3.  EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS.

         (a)      For 1994, a Participant's Employer shall make a matching
                  contribution equal to 50% of the Participant's Before-Tax
                  Contributions for 1994; in addition the Participant's Employer
                  shall make a matching contribution equal to the matching
                  contribution the Participant is precluded from receiving under
                  the 401(k) Plan because of the limits of Internal Reve nue
                  Code Section 401(m). In no event will the matching
                  contribution for 1994 exceed $4,620.

         (b)      Beginning January 1, 1995, each calendar quarter a
                  Participant's Em ployer shall make a matching contribution on
                  behalf of the Participant equal to 100% of the Participant's
                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregard ing Before-Tax
                  Contributions in excess of 2% of a Participant's Compensation)
                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions
                  (disregarding such contributions in excess of 4% of
                  Compensation) during the quarter, provided the Participant is
                  employed by an Em ployer on the last day of the quarter.

         (c)      In addition, beginning with the 1995 calendar year, a
                  Participant's Em ployer shall make an additional matching
                  contribution on behalf of the Participant as of the last day
                  of each calendar quarter so that the match ing contributions
                  for the Participant are equal to 100% of the Participant's
                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregarding Before-Tax Con
                  tributions in excess of 2% of the Participant's Compensation)
                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions
                  (disregarding such contribu tions in excess of 4% of
                  Compensation) during the year, provided the

                                      -5-

<PAGE>


                  Participant is employed by an Employer on the last day of the
                  quarter.

         (d)      Such Employer contributions shall be called "Employer Matching
                  Con tributions." The Employers shall make such contributions
                  by crediting Participants' accounts as provided in subsection
                  3.6. Beginning with the 1995 calendar year, the Employer
                  Matching Contribution for a Par ticipant for any year shall
                  not exceed 50% of the then current limit un der Section 402(g)
                  of the Internal Revenue Code.

3.4. EMPLOYER PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS. Each calendar year, a Participant's
Employer shall make on behalf of the Participant an "Employer Profit Sharing
Contribution" in an amount equal to a percentage of the Participant's
Compensation for the year, such percentage to be the percentage of compensation
received as a profit sharing contribution for such year by eligible participants
in the 401(k) Plan; provided a Participant shall not receive a Profit Shar ing
Contribution for a year unless he is employed by an Employer on the last day of
the year or terminated employment with all Employers during the year because of
death, Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the 401(k) Plan).
The Employer shall make the contributions by crediting the Participants'
accounts as provided in subsection 3.6.

3.5. LIMITATION ON CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, in no event shall the contributions to the Plan made by or on
on behalf of a Participant ex ceed for any year the lesser of (a) $30,000 (or
such greater amount as may be provided under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code); or (b) 25% of taxable earnings from the Employers as
reflected on Form W-2 (which earnings shall be adjusted by addition of any
compensation deferral contributions under this Plan and any deferrals or
reductions under Sections 401(k) and 125 of the Internal Revenue Code). The
limitation of this subsection shall be applied to reduce (i) first, Employer
Profit Sharing Contributions otherwise made on behalf of the Participant, and
(ii) then, Participant Before-Tax Contri-

                                      -6-

<PAGE>


butions and any corre sponding Employer Matching Contributions made on behalf of
the Participant. The Employ ers shall compensate the Participant for any
Before-Tax Contributions that the Participant elected to make to the Plan but
that cannot be made because of such limitations.

3.6. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain separate bookkeeping
accounts in the name of each Participant to reflect the Participant's Before-Tax
Contributions, and the Em ployer Matching and Profit Sharing Contributions made
on his behalf. Contributions shall be credited (and payments shall be debited)
to accounts in such manner and at such time as the Committee shall determine on
a uniform basis. A Participant's accounts shall be deemed invested in
hypothetical investment funds ("Funds") in such proportions as the Participant
may elect. The Funds shall be those in which 401(k) Plan participants may direct
the invest ment of their accounts, unless the Committee shall determine
otherwise. Each Participant shall elect the Funds in which his accounts are
deemed to be invested pursuant to rules adopt ed by the Committee. If the
Participant fails to select such Funds, the Participant shall be deemed to have
elected such Fund as the Committee shall determine. Each Participant's ac counts
shall be adjusted as of such dates specified by the Committee to reflect
contributions, payments and the investment gains and losses of the Funds. One of
the Funds shall reflect investment in common stock of the Company ("Company
Stock") subject to the following rules:

         (a)      Employer Matching and Profit Sharing Contributions that are
                  credited to accounts on or after September 30, 1997 shall be
                  deemed invested in Company Stock, and Participants may not
                  elect otherwise.

         (b)      A Participant may elect that any percentage (up to 100%) of
                  the other portion of his existing accounts be deemed invested
                  in Company Stock, and any such election may not be reversed. A
                  Participant may elect that all or any percentage of his future
                  compensation deferrals be deemed invested in Company Stock,
                  and any such percentage may not be reduced.

                                      -7-

<PAGE>


         (c)      Any election to have any portion of his accounts deemed
                  invested in Company Stock shall be subject to such rules as
                  the Committee may determine for any reason, including
                  compliance with federal or state securities laws.

3.7. TIME OF DISTRIBUTION; VESTING OF ACCOUNTS. Upon a Participant's termination
of employ ment with all Employers on account of death, Disability or Retirement,
the Participant (or in the event of his death, his Plan Beneficiary, as defined
in subsection 4.1) shall be entitled to receive the entire balance in all his
accounts in the manner provided in subsection 3.8. Upon a Participant's
termination of employment for any reason other than death, Disability or Retire
ment, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the entire balance in his
Before-Tax Contribu tion Account and the following percentage of his Employer
Matching and Profit Sharing Con tribution Accounts, based on his Years of
Service:

            YEARS OF SERVICE                         VESTING PERCENTAGE
            ----------------                         ------------------
         Less than three                                  0%
         Three but less than four                        25%
         Four but less than five                         50%
         Five or more                                   100%

For this purpose, Years of Service shall be Years of Qualifying Service as
determined under the 401(k) Plan. A Participant who is removed as a Covered
Employee (as provided in sub section 2.1) shall not be eligible to make
Before-Tax Contributions or to have Employer Matching Contributions or Employer
Profit Sharing Contributions made on his behalf for any period he is not a
Covered Employee; such a Participant may continue to elect the investment of his
accounts among the Funds as provided in subsection 3.6 and may be eligible for
pay ment of benefits in accordance with subsection 3.10 and 3.11, but shall not
be eligible for a distribution of accounts under subsections 3.7 and 3.8 until
he terminates employment with all Employers; such a Participant shall continue
to accrue Years of Service for vesting until he terminates employment with all
Employers.

3.8. DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS. Unless the Participant elects installment
distributions as pro vided below, benefits that become payable under this Plan
shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Participant has
terminated employment with all Employers. A Partici pant may elect to receive
his accounts in annual installments with the first installment due by January 31
of the calendar year following the year in which the Participant terminates
employ ment; each successive installment shall be due by January 31 of the next
year. The distribu tion period shall be five years, and the amount of each
installment shall be equal to the ac count balances as of the December 31
preceding the distribution divided by the number of remaining installments, with
the last installment equal to the entire remaining account bal ances. Any such
election to receive installments must be made and filed with the Committee at
least twelve months before termination of employment. Upon the death of a
Participant, any remaining amounts in his accounts shall be paid to his
Beneficiary as soon as practicable after the Participant's death.

3.9. CHANGE IN CONTROL. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 3.7 and
3.8, a Partici pant shall be fully vested in his entire account balances upon a
Change in Control (as defined below). A Participant's entire account balances
shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after a Change in Control. A Change
in Control shall mean any of the following:

         (a)      any person other than an entity owned directly or indirectly
                  by the Ben eficial Owners of 50% or more of the combined
                  voting power of the Company's outstanding securities on the
                  effective date of this Plan be comes the Beneficial Owner
                  (directly or indirectly) of 50% or more of the combined voting
                  power of the Company's then outstanding securi ties; or

         (b)      a transaction or series of related transactions that results
                  in the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's
                  assets. As used in the preced ing sentence, the terms "person"
                  and "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meanings set forth in
                  Section 15 of the Equity Team Plan.

3.10. IN-SERVICE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. Prior to his termination of employment
with the Em ployers a Participant may elect to receive a portion (up to 90% but
subject to such minimum as the Committee may determine) of the vested balance in
his accounts provided that the Participant shall forfeit from the remaining
portion of his vested accounts 10% of the amount the Participant elects to
receive pursuant to this subsection. A Participant who receives a payment of
benefits pursuant to this subsection will be ineligible to make Participant
Before-Tax Contributions or to have Matching Contributions made on his behalf
for the twelve-month period beginning on the date he receives such benefits.

3.11. HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS. A Participant may elect to receive all or a portion
(but subject to such minimum as the Committee may determine) of the vested
balance in his accounts if he has a "financial hardship," as determined by the
Committee. For this purpose a hardship may mean the following:

         (a)      Purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal
                  residence for the Participant.

         (b)      Payment of tuition for the next semester, or quarter of
                  post-secondary education for the Participant, his or her
                  spouse, children or dependents.

         (c)      Unreimbursed medical expenses described in Section 213(d) of
                  the In ternal Revenue Code incurred by the Participant, his or
                  her spouse, or any dependents of the Participant (as defined
                  in Section 152 of the In ternal Revenue Code).

         (d)      The need to prevent the eviction of the Participant from his
                  or her prin cipal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of
                  the Participant's prin cipal residence.

         (e)      Any other event that the Committee determines constitutes a
                  severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from a
                  sudden and unex-


                                      -10-

                  pected illness or accident or other similar extraordinary and
                  unforesee able circumstances arising as a result of events
                  beyond the control of the Participant.

A determination by the Committee as to whether a hardship exists shall be
binding and con clusive on all parties. A Participant who receives a payment of
benefits pursuant to this sub secton will be ineligible to make Participant
Before-Tax Contributions or to have Matching Contributions made on his behalf
for the twelve-month period beginning on the date he re ceives such benefits.

4.1. PLAN BENEFICIARY. A "Plan Beneficiary" means a person designated by a
Participant in writing and filed with the Committee prior to the Participant's
death. If a Participant failed to designate a Plan Beneficiary, or if the
designated person predeceases the Participant, the Par ticipant's Beneficiary
under the Plan shall be the same Beneficiary designated under the 401(k) Plan,
and in the absence of a designated Beneficiary under the 401(k) Plan, the Plan
Beneficiary shall be determined pursuant to the beneficiary rules contained in
the 401(k) Plan.

5.1. STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall furnish each Participant with a
statement of his accounts under this Plan quarterly or as otherwise determined

other Employer or to any benefits not specifically provided by this Plan.

5.3. INTERESTS NOT TRANSFERABLE. Except as to withholding of any tax under the
laws of the United States or any state or municipality or pursuant to a valid

Beneficiaries in the Plan are not subject to the claims of their creditors and
may not be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, assigned, alienated or
encumbered. For purposes of this subsection, a valid domestic relations order

as used in the Plan with respect to the Company or any subsidiary shall include
any successor to that corporation by reason of merger, consolidation, the
purchase or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of that
corporation, or otherwise. After a Change in Control, as defined in subsection
3.9, the benefits of Participants and beneficiaries shall be guaranteed by any
entity that, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the outstanding
shares of common stock or the combined voting power of the Company.

5.8. FACILITY OF PAYMENT. Any amounts payable hereunder to any person under a
legal disability or who, in the judgment of the Committee, is unable to properly
manage his affairs may be paid to the legal representative of such person or may
be applied for the benefit of such person in any manner which the Committee may
select. Any payment made in accordance with the next preceding sentence shall be
a full and complete discharge of any liability for such payment under the Plan.

5.9. TAX WITHHOLDING. The Employers may withhold for tax purposes (including

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

Although the Employers expect to continue the Plan, the Company must necessarily
reserve and reserves the right to amend the Plan from time to time or to
terminate the Plan at any time. However, no amendment of the Plan, nor the

that were accrued and payable up to the date of such amendment or termination.
With respect to the preceding sentence, an accrued benefit shall equal amounts
allocated to a Participant's

                                      -13-

                                CLAIMS AND REVIEW

7.1. CLAIMS PROCEDURE. If a claim for benefits under the Plan is denied in whole
or in part, the employee will receive written notification. The notification
will include specific reasons for the denial, specific reference to pertinent
Plan provisions, a description of any additional material or information
necessary to process the claim and why such material or information is

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                               SUNBEAM CORPORATION
                                STOCK OPTION PLAN

                        (Amended as of October 30, 1997)

1.       PURPOSE.

         The purpose of the Sunbeam Corporation Stock Option Plan is to provide
         incentives for selected executives, key employees, Outside Directors
         and Designated Others to promote the financial success and progress of
         Sunbeam Corporation. Capitalized terms used throughout this Plan shall
         have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 16 hereof.

2.       STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of this Section and Section 9, the
                  maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the
                  Plan is 11,500,000 shares, to be allocated as follows:

                  (i)      11,300,000 shares may be issued in connection with
                           the grant of Options pursuant to Section 3; and

                  (ii)     200,000 shares may be issued in connection with the
                           grant of Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to Section
                           3.

                  Such shares may be either authorized but unissued shares or
                  treasury shares.

         (b)      The number of shares subject to an Option or a Restricted
                  Stock Award that has been granted under the Plan shall no
                  longer be charged against the limitation provided in Section
                  2(a), and may again be made subject to Options or Restricted
                  Stock Awards, as the case may be, to the extent that Options
                  expire unexercised or are terminated, surrendered or canceled
                  before exercise or Restricted Stock Awards are forfeited,
                  terminated, surrendered or canceled due to a Participant's
                  termination of employment or service as an Outside Director or
                  for any other reason.

3.       GRANTS OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may at
                  any time, or from time to time, grant Options to officers, key
                  employees, Outside Directors of the Company (or its
                  subsidiaries) and Designated Others.

         (b)      Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may at
                  any time, or from time to time, grant shares of Stock which
                  are subject to the Restrictions set forth in Section 4(b)
                  ("Restricted Stock") to officers, key employees and Outside
                  Directors of the Company (or its subsidiaries) and Designated
                  Others.

         (c)      The Committee shall cause shares of Restricted Stock to be
                  issued to each Outside Director immediately and automatically
                  upon his or her election, re-election or appointment as a
                  Director of the Company. If such Outside Director is elected
                  at an Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company (the
                  "Annual Meeting"), the number of shares of Restricted Stock to
                  be issued shall be 1,500. The number of shares of Restricted
                  Stock to be issued to an Outside Director who is

                  elected or appointed at any time other than at an Annual
                  Meeting shall be 1,500 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
                  of which shall be the number of days after the date of such
                  election to and including the date of the next Annual Meeting
                  (which for such purpose shall be assumed to be the next May
                  15) and the denominator of which shall be 365; provided,
                  however, (i) that in the case of an Outside Director elected
                  to the Board for the first time during the period beginning
                  August 1, 1996 and ending December 31, 1996, the number of
                  such shares shall not be prorated, and each such Outside
                  Director shall receive 1,500 shares for the period of his
                  service between the date of his election and the date of the
                  next Annual Meeting (assumed to be May 15, 1997); and (ii)
                  that each incumbent Outside Director, elected prior to August
                  1, 1996, shall receive that number of shares of Restricted
                  Stock which results from applying to 1,500 such shares the
                  proration formula provided above, using for such calculation
                  the period from August 6, 1996 until and including the date of
                  the next Annual Meeting (assumed to be May 15, 1997).

         (d)      Deleted.

         (e)      Each Option shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement,
                  and each Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced by a
                  Restricted Stock Award Agreement, each in a form approved by
                  the Committee or by a Company officer designated by the
                  Committee.

         (f)      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no person
                  shall be granted Options for more than 250,000 shares of Stock
                  or Restricted Stock Awards for more than 25,000 shares of
                  Stock in any single fiscal year of the Company.

                           date specified in the Stock Option Agreement.
                           Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Participants
                           who are subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
                           shall have until the earlier of (A) the tenth

                           1996 Amendment Date and Options which are
                           Out-of-the-Money as of the 1996 Amendment Date;
                           provided, however, that no such Option may be

                  (iii)    All Restrictions shall lapse with respect to the
                           Restricted Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award
                           made to an Outside Director pursuant to Section 3(c)
                           hereof immediately and automatically upon the
                           Director's acceptance of election or appointment as a

                           respect to any grant of Options or Restricted Stock),
                           all other Options granted under the Plan (from and
                           after July 18, 1996) shall become exercisable with
                           respect to one-third of the shares subject to the
                           Option beginning on the first anniversary of the
                           Grant Date and as to an additional one-third on each
                           of the second and third anniversaries of the Grant
                           Date (each twelve month period ending on an
                           anniversary of a Grant Date being referred to herein
                           as an "Option Year"), provided in each case that the
                           Participant shall have remained an employee or a
                           director of the Company (or a subsidiary), or in the
                           case of a Designated Other, shall have remained in
                           the position set forth in the Stock Option Agreement,
                           continuously since the Grant Date. Notwithstanding
                           the foregoing, during the remaining term of any
                           options (if not already so exercisable) : (A) if a
                           Participant's employment or service as a director, or
                           in the case of a Designated Other, the period of
                           service as defined in the Stock Option Agreement,
                           terminates due to death, all Options held by the
                           Participant at death shall become immediately
                           exercisable in full; (B) upon a Change in Control,
                           all Options held by such Participant who is then an
                           employee or director of the Company (or a subsidiary)
                           shall become immediately exercisable in full; and (C)
                           in the event that the exercisability of an Option
                           accelerates due to a Change in Control, Participants
                           who are subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
                           may not sell the shares acquired upon such
                           accelerated exercise within six months of the Grant
                           Date of such Option.

                  (iv)     Except to the extent permitted by Rule 16b-3 or its
                           successor, Options shall not be sold, assigned,
                           transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise
                           disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent
                           and distribution, pursuant to a qualified domestic
                           relations order ("QDRO") as defined in the Code or
                           ERISA (or the rules thereunder) or as otherwise set
                           forth in this Section 4(a)(iv). Each Option shall be
                           exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only
                           by the Participant to whom it was granted, and after
                           the Participant's death only by the Participant's
                           estate or legal representative. To the extent
                           exercisable, an Option may be exercised in whole at
                           any time, or in part from time to time, during the
                           term of the Option.

                  (v)      Any Option may be converted, modified, forfeited or
                           canceled, prospectively or retroactively, in whole or
                           in part, by the Committee in its sole discretion;
                           provided, phowever, that no such action shall
                           adversely affect the rights of any Participant under
                           any

                           Option granted prior to such action without his
                           consent. Except as may be otherwise provided in an
                           Agreement, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
                           in whole or in part, waive any restrictions or
                           conditions applicable to, or accelerate the vesting
                           of, any Option.

         (b)      STOCK AWARDS.

                  (i)      Upon the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, a stock
                           certificate representing a number of shares of Stock
                           equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock
                           granted to a Participant shall be registered in the
                           Participant's name but shall be held in custody by
                           the Company for the Participant's account. The
                           Participant shall generally have the rights and
                           privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted
                           Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted
                           Stock, except that the following restrictions (the
                           "Restrictions") shall apply: (A) the Participant
                           shall not be entitled to delivery of the certificate
                           until the Restricted Period (set forth in paragraph
                           (iii) below) applicable to such Restricted Stock has
                           expired or terminated and until any other conditions
                           prescribed by the Committee are satisfied; (B) none
                           of the Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred,
                           assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or
                           disposed of during the Restricted Period applicable
                           to such Restricted Stock and prior to the
                           satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by
                           the Committee; and (C) shares of Restricted Stock
                           shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant
                           to such Restricted Stock shall terminate without
                           further obligation on the part of the Company unless
                           the Participant has (1) remained an employee or a
                           director of the Company (or a subsidiary) until the
                           expiration or termination of the Restricted Period
                           applicable to such Restricted Stock (or in the case
                           of a Designated Other, the duration specified in the
                           Restricted Stock Award Agreement) and (2) satisfied
                           any other conditions prescribed by the Committee
                           applicable to such Restricted Stock. At the
                           discretion of the Committee, cash and stock dividends
                           with respect to the Restricted Stock may be either
                           currently paid or withheld by the Company for the
                           Participant's account. Cash dividends so withheld by
                           the Committee shall not be subject to forfeiture.
                           Upon the forfeiture of any shares of Restricted
                           Stock, such forfeited Restricted Stock shall be
                           transferred to the Company without further action by
                           the Participant. The Participant shall have the same
                           rights and privileges, and be subject to the
                           Restrictions, with respect to any shares or other
                           property received pursuant to Section 9.

                  (ii)     Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted
                           Period with respect to shares of Restricted Stock and
                           the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed
                           by the Committee, the Restrictions applicable to such
                           Restricted Stock shall lapse and a stock certificate
                           for the number of shares of Stock with respect to
                           which the Restricted Period has lapsed shall be
                           delivered, free of all restrictions, except any that
                           may be imposed by law, to the Participant or the
                           Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may
                           be. The Company shall not be required to deliver any
                           fractional share of Stock but will pay, in lieu
                           thereof, the Fair Market Value (determined as of the
                           date the Restricted Period expires or terminates) of
                           such fractional share to the Participant or the
                           Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may
                           be. No payment will be required from the Participant
                           upon the issuance or delivery of any shares of Stock
                           under this paragraph, except that any amount
                           necessary to satisfy applicable federal, state or
                           local tax requirements shall be withheld or paid
                           promptly upon notification of the amount due and
                           prior to or concurrently with the issuance or
                           delivery of a certificate representing such shares.

                  (iii)    Unless otherwise specified by the Committee at the
                           time of the award and included in the Restricted
                           Stock Award Agreement, the Restrictions shall also
                           lapse with respect to one- third of the Restricted
                           Stock subject to all other Restricted Stock Awards on
                           each of the first through the third anniversaries of
                           the Grant Date, provided in each case that the
                           Participant shall have remained an employee or a
                           director of the Company (or a subsidiary)
                           continuously since the date of grant (or in the case
                           of a Designated Other, shall have complied with the
                           terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Award
                           Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) if a
                           Participant's employment or service as a director, or
                           in the case of a Designated Other, the period defined
                           in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, terminates
                           due to death, the Restrictions shall lapse with
                           respect to all Restricted Stock Awards held by the
                           Participant at death (if not already so lapsed); (B)
                           upon a Change in Control, the Restrictions shall
                           lapse with respect to all Restricted Stock Awards
                           held by such Participant who is an employee or
                           director of the Company (or a subsidiary) (if not
                           already so lapsed); and (C) in the event of an
                           accelerated lapse of Restrictions due to a Change in
                           Control, Participants who are subject to Section
                           16(b) of the Exchange Act may not sell the shares of
                           Stock whose Restrictions have so lapsed within six
                           months of the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock
                           Award pursuant to which such Stock was received. The
                           "Restricted Period" as to any shares constituting
                           part of a Restricted Stock Award shall be the period
                           of time commencing with the Grant Date of a
                           Restricted Stock Award and ending with the date on
                           which the Restrictions lapse with respect to any such
                           shares, or any portion thereof.

         (c)      In the event that the acceleration of (i) the exercisability
                  of an Option or (ii) the lapse of Restrictions relating to
                  Restricted Stock upon a Change in Control and a Change in
                  Status results in excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the
                  Code, or any successor or similar provision thereto, or
                  comparable state or local tax laws, the Company shall pay to
                  the Participant such additional compensation as is necessary
                  (after taking into account all Federal, state and local income
                  and excise taxes payable by the Participant as a result of the
                  receipt of such compensation ) to place the Participant in the
                  same after-tax position he would have been in had no such
                  excise tax (or any interest or penalties thereon) been paid or
                  incurred. The amount of such payment shall be determined by
                  the independent accounting firm serving as the Company's
                  outside auditor immediately prior to the Change in Control.

5.       EXERCISE OF OPTIONS.

         (a)      The Exercise Price of the shares purchasable under an Option
                  shall be the Fair Market Value per share on the Grant Date of
                  such Option, subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to the
                  provisions of Section 9.

         (b)      Options shall be considered exercised (herein the "Exercise
                  Date") on the date written notice, in such form as the
                  Committee may prescribe, is received by the Option Plan
                  Administrator of the Company, advising of the exercise of an
                  Option and either transmitting payment of the total Exercise
                  Price for the number of shares of Stock involved or electing
                  one of the alternative payment procedures set forth in Section
                  5(c) below.

         (c)      The Exercise Price shall be paid in cash (including cash
                  obtained through a margin loan on the shares as to which the
                  Option is being exercised) or (and provided (x) the use of the
                  following procedure by a Participant would comply with
                  safeguards established by the Committee designed to

                                        5

                  to avoid "short-swing" profits to the Participant under
                  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and (y) does not otherwise
                  violate any applicable laws) through (i) a broker-assisted
                  cashless exercise program established by the Committee, based
                  on the actual proceeds from the sale of share of Stock; or
                  (ii) in shares of Stock, valued on the basis of the closing
                  market price of the Stock on the Exercise Date.

         (d)      Subject to the provisions of Section 6 and the other
                  provisions of the Plan, the Stock Option Agreement and the
                  Option, the Company shall issue shares of Stock in the
                  Participant's name as soon as practicable (but in no event
                  later than 30 days) after the Exercise Date. The Participant
                  shall not be deemed to be a holder of any shares pursuant to
                  an Option, and shall not have any rights as a stockholder in
                  connection with such shares, until the date of transfer of
                  shares of Stock to the Participant. The Company shall have no
                  liability of any nature whatsoever to any Participant by
                  reason of any change in the market price of the Stock during
                  the period of time between the Exercise Date and the date on
                  which any shares of Stock resulting from the exercise are
                  issued or sold.

6.       RESTRICTIONS.

         (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, an Option or
                  Restricted Stock Award to the contrary, no Option shall be
                  exercised, and the Company shall not be obligated to issue or
                  transfer shares of Stock under any Option or Restricted Stock
                  Award, until the Company shall have received such assurances
                  as the Company may reasonably request from its counsel that
                  the exercise of the Option and the issuance and transfer of
                  shares pursuant to the Option or Restricted Stock Award will
                  not violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any
                  other applicable Federal or state laws. In connection with any
                  such issuance or transfer, the Participant shall, if requested
                  by the Company, give assurances satisfactory to counsel to the
                  Company, in respect of the Participant's investment intent or
                  such other matters as counsel to the Company may deem
                  necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all
                  applicable legal requirements.

         (b)      No provisions of the Plan or any Option or Restricted Stock
                  Award shall be interpreted or construed to obligate the
                  Company to register any Stock under Federal or state law.

         (c)      The Company and the Committee reserve the right to investigate
                  at any time the circumstances surrounding any exercise of
                  Options, including any investigation regarding whether a
                  Participant is in compliance with the provisions of Section 13
                  hereof (or has threatened or is reasonably believed to intend
                  to violate the provisions of Section 13 hereof), and the
                  Company and the Committee shall have no liability or
                  responsibility to any Participant for any alleged damage
                  sustained by the Participant by reason of any delay in the
                  implementation of an Option exercise during the pendency of
                  any such investigation, whether by reason of any change in the
                  market price of the Stock or otherwise.

         (d)      Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Committee
                  shall have the right at any time to deny or delay a
                  Participant's exercise of Options if such Participant is
                  reasonably believed by the Committee (i) to be engaged in
                  material conduct adversely affecting the Company or (ii) to be
                  contemplating such conduct, unless and until the Committee
                  shall have received reasonable assurance that the Participant
                  is not engaged in, and is not contemplating, such material
                  conduct adverse to the interests of the Company.

                                       6

         (e)      Participants are and at all times shall remain subject to the
                  trading window policies adopted by the Company from time to
                  time throughout the period of time during which they may
                  exercise Options or sell Restricted Stock granted pursuant to
                  the Plan. Participants may request at any time a copy of any
                  calendar of scheduled open windows by contacting the Option
                  Plan Administrator.

7.       FAIR MARKET VALUE.

         (a)      During any period that the Company's Stock is Actively Traded,
                  Fair Market Value shall be equal to the average selling price
                  of a share of Stock on the exchange or national market system
                  on which the Stock is traded, on the date of grant of an
                  option to acquire Stock pursuant to the Plan, or pursuant to
                  such other method as the Committee may reasonably specify for
                  determining the Stock's Fair Market Value.

         (b)      During any period during which the Company's Stock is not
                  Actively Traded, Fair Market Value shall be determined by the
                  Committee.

8.       TERM.

         This Amended and Restated Plan shall be effective as of the date set
         forth on the first page hereof. No Option or Restricted Stock Award
         shall be granted under the Plan after February 12, 2006, but the Plan
         shall continue in effect thereafter with respect to any previously
         granted Options and Restricted Stock Awards that remain outstanding and
         the duration of any such grant or award shall not be affected by the
         expiration of the Plan.

9.       ADJUSTMENTS.

         In the event that any recapitalization, or reclassification, split-up
         or consolidation of shares of Stock shall be effected, or the
         outstanding shares of Stock shall, in connection with a merger or
         consolidation of the Company or a transaction or series of related
         transactions that results in the sale of all or substantially all of
         the Company's assets, be exchanged for a different number or class of
         shares of stock or other securities or property of the Company or any
         other Person, or a record date or dates for determination of holders of
         Stock entitled to receive a dividend payable in stock or a liquidating
         dividend (or series of dividends) shall occur, equitable and
         proportional adjustments aimed at preventing the inequitable
         enlargement or dilution of any rights hereunder shall be made to (i)
         the number and class of shares or other securities or property that may
         be issued or transferred pursuant to the Plan and any outstanding
         Options and Restricted Stock Awards and (ii) the Exercise Price to be
         paid per share under any outstanding Options; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
         in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company, or similar
         transaction pursuant to which the outstanding Stock is exchanged for
         cash or other property, the unexercised Options shall thereafter be
         exercisable for, and the Restricted Stock Awards shall entitle the
         Participant to receive, the cash or other property which an Option or
         Restricted Stock Award holder, as the case may be, would have been
         entitled to receive had the Options been exercised, or the Restrictions
         relating to the Restricted Stock Award lapsed, immediately prior to the
         record date for such merger, consolidation or similar transaction
         except to the extent that provision is made in writing in connection
         with such transaction for (1) the assumption of the Options by, or the
         substitution for the Options of new options covering the stock of, a
         successor acquiring corporation, in each case providing terms no less
         favorable to the holder of such Options than would an assumption or
         substitution described in Treasury Regulation /section/1.425-1(a) that
         would not constitute a "modification" for purposes of Code
         /section/424(a), and (2) the substitution for Restricted Stock Awards
         of stock of a successor or acquiring corporation having terms no less
         favorable to the holder thereof than the terms

                                       7
<PAGE>



         of the Restricted Stock Award in effect before such transaction.

10.      ADMINISTRATION.

         (a)      The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee
                  shall, subject to the provisions of the Plan, have full power
                  and authority to administer the Plan, to select the
                  Participants in the Plan, and, except for grants and awards
                  which are automatically made to Outside Directors as provided
                  pursuant to Section 3 of the Plan, to determine the number of
                  shares to be made subject to each Option and Restricted Stock
                  Award and all terms and conditions of each Option and
                  Restricted Stock Award. The Committee shall have the power to
                  interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules for the
                  administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as
                  are consistent therewith and to interpret, amend or revoke any
                  such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and
                  determinations made by the Committee shall be final and
                  binding upon all Participants, the Company and all other
                  interested persons, absent a determination by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction that the Committee has acted in bad
                  faith or has engaged in reckless or willful misconduct.

         (b)      Members of the Committee and the Board and officers
                  administering this Plan shall be fully protected in taking
                  actions under the Plan or in relying upon the advice of
                  counsel and shall incur no liability except for bad faith,
                  recklessness or willful misconduct in the performance of their
                  duties.

         (c)      Except as required by Rule 16b-3 with respect to grants of
                  Options to individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the
                  Exchange Act, or as otherwise required for compliance with
                  Rule 16b-3 or other applicable law, the Committee may delegate
                  all or any part of its authority under the Plan to an
                  employee, employees or committee of employees.

         (d)      To the extent the Committee deems it necessary, appropriate or
                  desirable to comply with foreign law or practices and to
                  further the purpose of the Plan, the Committee may, without
                  amending this Plan, establish special rules applicable to
                  Options granted to Participants who are foreign nationals, are
                  employed outside the United States, or both, including rules
                  that differ from those set forth in the Plan, and grant
                  Options to such Participants in accordance with those rules.

         (e)      Determinations by the Committee under the Plan relating to the
                  form, amount and terms and conditions of grants and awards
                  need not be uniform, and may be made selectively among persons
                  who receive or are eligible to receive grants and awards under
                  the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated.

11.      GENERAL PROVISIONS.

         (a)      Nothing in this Plan or in any instrument executed pursuant
                  hereto shall confer upon any Person any right to continue in
                  the employment or other service of the Company (or any
                  subsidiary), or shall affect the right of the Company (or any
                  subsidiary) to terminate the employment or other service of
                  any person at any time with or without Cause.

         (b)      The Company may make appropriate provisions for the
                  withholding of any taxes which the Company determines it is
                  required to withhold in connection with any Option or
                  Restricted Stock Award including, at the request of a
                  Participant and provided that it does not violate any
                  applicable

                  laws, the payment of such withholding taxes through a
                  broker-assisted sale of a sufficient number of shares
                  underlying the Option or subject to the Restricted Stock Award
                  or by delivery to the Company of shares of Stock previously
                  owned by the Participant, in either case having an actual sale
                  price equal to the amount of such taxes. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, a Participant whose transactions in Stock are
                  subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act may make a share
                  withholding election only if it complies with safeguards
                  established by the Committee designed to avoid "short swing"
                  profits to the Participant under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
                  Act. The certificates evidencing a Restricted Stock Award made
                  to an Outside Director pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof shall
                  be automatically reduced by 28% to provide for the estimated
                  Federal income tax payment obligation of the Outside Director,
                  or by such other higher percentage as may be required by law
                  to be withheld, with the Company remitting to the appropriate
                  tax authorities the fair market value of the Restricted Stock
                  Award for which the certificates are not so delivered.

         (c)      By accepting any benefits under the Plan, each Participant,
                  and each Person claiming under or through the Participant,
                  shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated acceptance and
                  ratification of, and consent to, all provisions of the Plan.
                  Each Participant hereby further agrees that amendments and
                  modifications to the Plan, which may be adopted from time to
                  time by the Committee and/or the Board of the Corporation (as
                  set forth in Section 12 hereof), shall be binding upon such
                  Participant and upon all Options or Restricted Stock which the
                  Participant may hold, including (with retroactive effect)
                  Options or Restricted Stock previously granted to the
                  Participant, except to the extent set forth in Section 12
                  hereof.

         (d)      With respect to Participants subject to Section 16 of the
                  Exchange Act, transactions under the Plan are intended to
                  comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its
                  successor. To the extent any provision the Plan or action by
                  the Plan administrators fails to so comply, it shall be deemed
                  null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed
                  advisable by the Committee.

         (e)      A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the
                  Company with respect to any Shares to be issued upon exercise
                  of an Option until such Participant has exercised such Option
                  and becomes a holder of such Shares.

12.      AMENDMENTS; MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION.

         This Plan may be amended or modified by the Committee, with
         ratification by the Board, or terminated by the Board, at any time and
         in any respect, except that no amendment shall be made without the
         approval of the shareholders of the Company if shareholder approval
         would be required by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any other law
         or rule of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other
         self-regulatory organization to which the Company is subject. No such
         amendment, modification or termination shall have effect to reduce the
         number of shares as to which any Option or Restricted Stock Award
         previously has been granted to a Participant; to extend the vesting
         schedule with respect to any Option or Restricted Stock Award or to
         extend the period of non-competition or confidentiality as set forth in
         Section 13 hereof. In the event of the passage of any law, rule or
         regulation or a determination by any regulatory agency or court,
         requiring an adverse change in the Company's accounting or tax
         treatment relating to the Plan, the Committee shall have the right to
         modify the terms of outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Awards to
         the extent necessary to avoid the adverse consequences of such change.

13.      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION; CONDUCT NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE
         CORPORATION.

         By accepting Options or Restricted Stock Awards under the Plan and as a
         condition to the exercise of Options and the enjoyment of any of the
         benefits of the Plan, each Participant agrees as follows:

         (a)      CONFIDENTIALITY -- During the period of each Participant's
                  employment or service as a director with the Company (or the
                  Participant's engaging in any other activity with or for the
                  Company) and for a two year period thereafter, each
                  Participant shall treat and safeguard as confidential and
                  secret all Confidential Information received by such
                  Participant at any time. Without the prior written consent of
                  the Company, except as required by law, such Participant will
                  not disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any
                  third party whatsoever or use the same in any manner except in
                  connection with the businesses of the Company and its
                  subsidiaries. In the event that a Participant is requested or
                  required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
                  information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand
                  or other process) to disclose (i) any Confidential Information
                  or (ii) any information relating to his opinion, judgment or
                  recommendations concerning the Company or its subsidiaries as
                  developed from the Confidential Information, Participant will
                  provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such
                  request or requirement so that the Company may seek an
                  appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
                  provisions contained herein. If, failing the entry of a
                  protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
                  Participant is, in the reasonable opinion of his counsel,
                  compelled to disclose Confidential Information, Participant
                  shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential
                  Information which his counsel advises that he is compelled to
                  disclose and will exercise best efforts to obtain assurances
                  that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
                  Information.

         (b)      NON-COMPETITION -- During the period of employment with the
                  Company or its subsidiaries of any Participant (other than a
                  director) compensated at a rate (including bonuses) in excess
                  of $75,000 per year in cash compensation from his employment
                  with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (determined as of
                  the most recently completed fiscal year of the Company), and,
                  for a two-year period thereafter (the "Non-Compete Period"),
                  each such Participant shall not, without prior written consent
                  of the Committee, do, directly or indirectly, any of the
                  following:

                  (1)      own, manage, control or participate in the ownership,
                           management, or control of, or be employed or engaged
                           by or otherwise affiliated or associated with, any
                           other corporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm,
                           association or other business entity, or otherwise
                           engage in any business which competes with the
                           business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
                           (as such business is conducted during the term of
                           such Participant's employment with the Company or its
                           subsidiaries) in the geographical regions in which
                           such business is conducted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
                           the ownership of a maximum of one percent of the
                           outstanding stock of any publicly traded corporation
                           shall not violate this covenant; or

                  (2)      employ, solicit for employment or assist in employing
                           or soliciting for employment any present, former or
                           future employee, officer or agent of the Company or
                           any of its subsidiaries.

                  In the event any court of competent jurisdiction should
                  determine that the foregoing covenant of non-competition is
                  not enforceable because of the extent of the geographical area
                  or the duration 

                                       10
<PAGE>



                  thereof, then the Company and the affected Participant hereby
                  petition such court to modify the foregoing covenant to the
                  extent, but only to the extent, necessary to create a covenant
                  which is enforceable in the opinion of such court, with the
                  intention of the parties that the Company shall be afforded
                  the maximum enforceable covenant of non-competition which may
                  be available under the circumstances and applicable law.

         (c)      Each Participant acknowledges that remedies at law for any
                  breach by him of this section 13 may be inadequate and that
                  the damages resulting from any such breach are not readily
                  susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly,
                  each Participant acknowledges that upon his violation of any
                  provision of this Section 13, the Company will be entitled to
                  immediate injunctive relief and may obtain an order
                  restraining any threatened or future breach. Each Participant
                  further agrees, subject to the proviso at the end of this
                  sentence, that if he violates any provision of this Section
                  13, he shall immediately forfeit any rights and benefits under
                  this Plan and shall return to the Company any unexercised
                  Options and forfeit the rights under any Restricted Stock
                  Awards and shall return any shares of Stock held by such
                  Participant received upon exercise of any Option or the lapse
                  of the Restrictions relating to Restricted Stock Awards
                  granted hereunder, together with any proceeds from sales of
                  any shares of Stock received upon exercise of such Options or
                  the lapse of Restrictions of such Restricted Stock Awards;
                  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that upon violation of subsection (b) of
                  this Section, the forfeiture and return provisions contained
                  in this sentence shall apply only to Options which have become
                  exercisable, and Restricted Stock, the Restrictions with
                  respect to which have lapsed, and in any such case the
                  proceeds of sales therefrom, during the two year period
                  immediately prior to termination of the Participant's
                  employment. Nothing in this Section 13 will be deemed to
                  limit, in any way, the remedies at law or in equity of the
                  Company, for a breach by Participant of any of the provisions
                  of this Section 13.

         (d)      Each Participant agrees to provide written notice of the
                  provisions of this Section 13 to any future employer of
                  Participant, and the Company expressly reserves the right to
                  provide such notice to the Participant's future employer(s).

         (e)      If any provision or part of any provision of this Section 13
                  is held for any reason to be unenforceable, (i) the remainder
                  of this Section 13 shall nevertheless remain in full force and
                  effect and (ii) such provision or part shall be deemed to be
                  amended in such manner as to render such provision
                  enforceable.

14.      GOVERNING LAW.

         The validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any rules
         relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of
         the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law.

15.      ARBITRATION.

         The Company and each Participant hereby agree that in the event of any
         dispute or controversy arising with respect to the Plan, any Stock
         Option Agreement, the exercise of any Option (or the disallowance of
         any exercise at any time, for any reason) or any other matter relating
         to Options or Restricted Stock Awards, then such dispute or controversy
         shall be submitted by the parties to mandatory and binding arbitration
         before a panel of arbitrators appointed by the American Arbitration
         Association ("AAA"), each of whom shall be knowledgeable in matters of
         securities in general and, if possible, the administration of stock
         option 

                                       11
<PAGE>



         programs similar to the Plan. The arbitration proceedings shall be
         conducted in whichever of the following cities is closest to the work
         location of the affected Participant: Delray Beach, Florida; New York,
         New York; Kansas City, Missouri; Jackson, Mississippi; or Atlanta,
         Georgia. The decision of the Company as to which city is closest to the
         work location of the Participant shall be conclusive and binding,
         except for manifest error. The decision of the arbitrators shall be
         rendered in writing, shall be promptly rendered after a hearing on the
         matter and shall be final, conclusive and binding and may be
         incorporated in a final judgment rendered by any court of competent
         jurisdiction.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall preclude
         the Company from seeking injunctive or other relief from any court of
         competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of Section 13 hereof.

16.      DEFINITIONS.

         The following terms, when used in the Plan, shall have the meanings set
         forth below:

                  Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ
                  National Market System in an average weekly volume that equals
                  at least 0.20% of the then outstanding Company Stock for each
                  of at least four weeks in a row.

                  BENEFICIAL OWNER: With respect to any securities of the
                  Company, any Person who is a beneficial owner of such

                  The Committee may from time to time adopt interpretations or
                  pronouncements as to who shall be deemed to be Beneficial
                  Owners of the Company's outstanding voting securities as of a
                  given date, which interpretation shall be final and binding on
                  all Participants, the Company and all other interested
                  Persons.

                  BOARD:  The Board of Directors of the Company.

                  CAUSE: Any cause stated in an employment agreement between the

                  dishonesty with respect to the Company, insubordination,
                  divulging confidential information about the Company,
                  interference with the relationship between the Company and any
                  supplier, client, customer, similar person, or performance of
                  any act or omission which the Committee, in its sole
                  discretion, deems to be sufficiently injurious to the interest
                  of the Company to constitute cause.

                  CHANGE IN CONTROL: The occurrence of any of the following: (i)

                  such Person (or a Person owned directly or indirectly by such
                  Person) was the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, as
                  of the Grant Date applicable to the affected Participant, of

                  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: Any information not generally known
                  to the public, including, without limiting the generality of
                  the foregoing, any customer lists, supplier lists, trade
                  secrets, invention, formulas, methods or processes, whether or

                  confidential or otherwise designated as such in writing by the
                  Company or its subsidiaries). It is not necessary, however,
                  that any information be formally designated as "confidential"
                  if it falls within any of the foregoing categories and is not
                  generally known to the public.

                               SUNBEAM BONUS PLAN

ELIGIBILITY: All exempt and non-exempt salaried employees. Note: "hourly"
production workers, Operating Committee members and certain other executives are
not eligible to participate. Additionally, any employee hired after October 1
will not be eligible until the following year.

PLAN DESIGN: 1. Each fiscal year, the Operating Committee will establish a
minimum level of acceptable performance, below which the Bonus Pool will be
zero. Performance of the corporation will be expressed in terms of Earnings Per
Share (EPS).

             2. All payouts under the Plan as well as Plan parameters are fully
discretionary and any payments under the Plan must be authorized by the
Operating Committee.

             3. All payments will be in cash, paid during the first quarter
following the end of the fiscal year, to all eligible participants actively
employed at the time of the payment.

TARGET BONUS

POOL: The target bonus pool will be the sum total of each participant's target
bonus amount. The actual earned bonus pool will be determined at fiscal year end
by comparing actual financial performance to targeted performance as determined
by the Corporate Business Plan. No bonuses will be paid if the Company fails to
reach its minimum objectives.

TARGET PAYOUTS:   EXEMPT - a percentage of base earnings

                  NON-EXEMPT - a flat dollar amount (prorated for partial -year
                               service)

PAYOUT
PARAMETERS:                1. below minimum performance standard = 0
                                            payout
                           2. target minimum payout threshold = 75% of target
                           3. target maximum payout limit = 200% of target

                           Individual Payouts

                           1. four (4) quantitative objectives established for
                              each employee
                           2. objectives reviewed by supervisor
                           3. payout will be determined by a combination of
                              Company EPS performance and individual performance
                              against mutually agreed upon goals & objectives

===============================================================================
* Earnings per share (EPS): Basically, net sales minus total cost of doing
business (overhead, materials, direct labor) equals operating profit. Operating
profit minus taxes and debt expense equals net earnings. Net earnings divided by
outstanding shares of stock equals EPS.

What does this mean to me? If our sales go up and/or if our expenses and debt
are reduced, then earnings per share (and the value of Sunbeam stock) goes up.

EXAMPLES:

At the end of 1998, the EPS is $2.25. 100% of the target bonus is available for
payout.

If the EPS is $1.75, then our minimum threshold is not reached and no bonuses
will be paid.

If the EPS is $2.75, then the maximum 200% of target bonus will be available for
payout.

Remember, once the Company performance has established the AVAILABLE bonus
amount (e.g., 100% of target in our first example and 200% of target in our
third example), your INDIVIDUAL bonus will be determined by your performance on
your four (4) objectives.

All awards are discretionary and must be approved by the Operating Committee.

                             CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

                          dated as of December 4, 1997

                             SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC.

                                       and

                       SUNBEAM ASSET DIVERSIFICATION, INC.

================================================================================

<PAGE>



         RECEIVABLES SALE AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (this "SALE AGREEMENT"),
dated as of December 4, 1997, by and between

         1.       Sunbeam Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "PARENT"),
                  and

         2.       Sunbeam Asset Diversification, Inc. , a Delaware corporation
                  ("FUNDING").

It is agreed as follows:

         Section 1.  DEFINITIONS.

         Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms shall have the
meanings set forth in the Receivables Purchase and Servicing Agreement (the
"RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT") dated as of December 4, 1997, by and among
Funding, as Seller, Llama Retail Funding, L.P., as Purchaser, Capital USA,
L.L.C., as Administrative Agent and the Parent, in its individual capacity and
as Servicer.

         Section 2.  AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER.

         (a) The Parent hereby agrees, on each Weekly Settlement Date (as
defined below), to sell, transfer, absolutely assign, set-over, convey and/or
contribute to the capital of Funding, all Receivables of each Designated Obligor
owned by the Parent as of the close of business on the immediately preceding
Weekly Settlement Date. The Parent and Funding shall enter into a certificate of
assignment (the "SALE ASSIGNMENT"), dated as of the date hereof, in the form of
Exhibit A hereto, evidencing such sale, transfer, absolute assignment, set-over,
conveyance and/or contribution of such Receivables by the Parent to Funding.
Each Receivable so sold, transferred, absolutely assigned, conveyed, set-over
and/or contributed to Funding is referred to herein as a "SOLD RECEIVABLE."

         (b) On the first Business Day of each week or such other day of the
week as agreed to from time to time by the Parent and Funding (each, a "WEEKLY
SETTLEMENT DATE"), Funding shall pay the Parent in respect of all Sold
Receivables constituting (as of the date such Receivable was transferred to
Funding) Eligible Receivables sold, transferred, absolutely assigned, conveyed
or set-over to Funding during the week immediately preceding such Weekly
Settlement Date an amount (the "Sale Price") equal to the lesser of (i) the cash
received by Funding on such day in respect of its financing of such Eligible
Receivables and (ii) the fair market value of such Eligible Receivables. To the
extent that the Sale Price for such Eligible Receivables is less than the fair
market value thereof, the difference shall be deemed a capital contribution by
the Parent to Funding. The Sale Price shall be payable by Funding in full by
wire transfer on each Weekly Settlement Date to an account designated by the
Parent on or before such Weekly Settlement Date. The fair market value of each
Sold Receivable that, as of the date such Receivable was transferred to Funding,
did not constitute an Eligible Receivable shall be deemed a capital contribution
by the Parent to Funding.

                                       2

<PAGE>

         (c) Upon the sale, transfer, absolute assignment, set-over, conveyance
and/or contribution of the Sold Receivables the ownership of each such
Receivable shall be vested in Funding and the Parent shall not take any action
inconsistent with such ownership and shall not claim any ownership interest in
any such Sold Receivable.

         (d) The Parent shall indicate in its Records that ownership of each
Sold Receivable is held by Funding or its assignee. In addition, the Parent
shall respond to any inquiries with respect to ownership of a Sold Receivable by
stating that it is no longer the owner of such Receivable and that ownership of
such Sold Receivable is held by Funding or its assignee.

         (e) The Parent shall provide for the direct remittance by each Obligor
of all Collections with respect to each Sold Receivable to the account specified
to it by the Administrative Agent.

         (f) Until such time as it is notified that Funding has transferred
ownership of a Sold Receivable or it is otherwise directed by Funding, the
Parent shall conduct the servicing, administration and collection of such Sold
Receivable and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such actions as may be
necessary or advisable to service, administer and collect such Sold Receivable,
from time to time, all in accordance with (i) customary and prudent servicing
procedures for receivables of a similar type, (ii) all applicable laws, rules
and regulations, and (iii) without limitation as to its obligations under the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), no less a standard of care than that which it
applies to Receivables it services for its own account.

         Section 3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT.

         The Parent, as of each day on which it transfers Receivables, hereby
represents to Funding for the benefit of Funding and each of its successors and
assigns as follows:

         (a) The Parent is an entity of the type set forth next to its name in
the first paragraph of this Agreement and is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is
duly qualified to do business, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified, has the power
and authority to own and convey all of its properties and to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Related Documents and to perform the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parent has complied in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders with respect
to it, its business and properties, and the performance of its obligations
hereunder and pursuant to the Related Documents.

         (b) The Parent is intended to be operated in such a manner that Funding
would not be substantively consolidated in the bankruptcy estate of the Parent
(that is, such that the separate existence of Funding and the Parent would be
disregarded), in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Parent and in
such regard the specific matters set forth in the representation and warranty of
the Seller in Section 4.1(b) of the Receivables Purchase Agreement regarding the
independent operation of the Parent and the Seller are true and correct in all
respects.

                                       3

<PAGE>

         (c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent of this
Agreement, the Related Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action
on the part of the Parent, (ii) do not contravene or cause the Parent to be in
default under (A) the Parent's formation, governance or other organizational
documents, any contractual restriction contained in any indenture, loan or
credit agreement, lease, mortgage, security agreement, bond, note, or other
agreement or instrument binding on or affecting the Parent or its property, or
(B) any law, rule, regulation, order, license requirement writ, judgment, award,
injunction, or decree applicable to, binding on or affecting the Seller or its
property or the Parent or its property, and (iii) do not result in or require
the creation of any Adverse Claim upon or with respect to any of the property of
Funding or the Parent (other than in favor of the Purchaser or the Collateral
Agent as contemplated under the Related Documents).

         (d) This Agreement and the Related Documents have each been duly
executed and delivered by the Parent and constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Parent enforceable against the Parent in accordance with its
respective terms.

         (e) No consent of, notice to, filing with or permits, qualifications or
other action by any Governmental Authority or any other party is required (i)
for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Parent of this Agreement
or any of the Related Documents, (ii) for the perfection of or the exercise by
each of Funding, the Purchaser, the Administrative Agent or any assignee of the
Purchaser of any of its rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder other than
consents, notices, filings and other actions which have been obtained or made
and complete copies of which have been provided to Funding, the Purchaser or the
Administrative Agent.

         (f) There is no pending or threatened, nor any reasonable basis for
any, action, suit or proceeding, against or affecting the Parent, its officers
or directors, or the property of the Parent, in any court or tribunal, before
any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority (A)
asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (B)
seeking to prevent the transfer, sale or pledge of any Sold Receivable or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (C)
seeking any determination or ruling that might materially and adversely affect
(1) the performance by each of Funding or the Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (2) the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (3) the Sold
Receivables or the Contracts, or (4) the federal income tax attributes of the
contribution, sale or pledge of the Sold Receivables, or (D) asserting a claim
for payment of money in excess of the Parent Judgment Amount (other than such
judgments or orders in respect of which adequate insurance, after application of
any deductible, is maintained by the Parent for the payment thereof).

         (g) The principal place of business and chief executive office of the
Parent are located at the address set forth under its name on the signature page
hereof and there are now no, and during the past four months there have not
been, any other locations where the Parent is located (as that term is used in
the UCC of the jurisdiction where such principal place of business is located)
or keeps Records, except, in each case, as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto. The
legal name of the Parent is as set forth at the beginning of this Agreement and
the Parent has not changed its name in the last six years, and during such
period the Parent did not use, nor does the Parent now use, any

                                       4

<PAGE>


tradenames, fictitious names, assumed names or "doing business as" names except
as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

         (h) The Parent is solvent and will not become insolvent after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Documents; the Parent is paying its Debts as they mature; the Parent has not
incurred Debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature; and the Parent, after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Documents, will have an adequate amount of capital to conduct its business in
the foreseeable future.

         (i) For federal income tax, reporting and accounting purposes, the
Parent will treat the sale of each Receivable sold, contributed or assigned to
Funding pursuant hereto as a sale or absolute assignment, of its full right,
title and ownership interest in such Receivable to Funding (and those
Receivables contributed to Funding by the Parent pursuant hereto shall be
accounted for as an increase in the stated capital of Funding), and the Parent
has not in any other respect accounted for or treated the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         (j) The Parent has complied in all material respects with all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders with respect to it, its business
and properties and all Receivables and related Contracts (including without
limitation, the Fair Labor Standards Act) and all restrictions contained in any
indenture, loan or credit agreement, mortgage, security agreement, bond, note or
other agreement or instrument binding on or affecting the Parent or its
property, and has and maintains all permits, licenses, authorizations,
registrations, approvals and consents of Governmental Authorities for (A) the
activities and business of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, (B) the ownership, use, operation and
maintenance by each of them of its properties, facilities and assets, and (C)
the performance by the Parent and Funding of this Agreement and the Related
Documents.

         (k) The Parent has filed on a timely basis all tax returns (federal,
state and local) required to be filed and has paid or made adequate provisions
for the payment of all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges due
from the Parent.

         (l) No transaction contemplated by this Agreement requires compliance
with any bulk sales act or similar law.

         (m) With respect to the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries, there has
occurred no event which has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the Parent's operations, including its ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or the Related Documents as Parent, Servicer or
otherwise.

         (n) The consolidated balance sheets of the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for each of the last two years in the period ending as at the
Balance Sheet Date and the related statements of income and shareholders' equity
of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the years then ended,
certified without qualification by independent certified public accountants,
copies of which have been furnished to the Purchaser and Administrative Agent,
fairly present the

                                       5

<PAGE>

consolidated financial condition, business and operations of the Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date and the consolidated results of the
operations of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the period ended
on such date, all in accordance with GAAP, and since the Balance Sheet Date
there has been no material adverse change in any such condition, business or
operations.

         (o) Each pension plan or profit sharing plan to which the Parent is a
party has been administered and fully funded in accordance with the obligations
of the Parent under law and as set forth in such plan, and the Parent has
complied with the applicable provisions of ERISA in effect as of each date on
which it transfers Receivables to Funding.

         (p) The Parent has valid business reasons for selling or contributing
its interests in the Receivables transferred hereunder rather than obtaining a
loan secured by such Receivables.

         (q) All information heretofore or hereafter furnished with respect to
the Parent to any of Funding, the Purchaser or the Administrative Agent in
connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Related
Documents, including, without limitation, each Request Notice, is and will be
true and complete in all material respects and does not and will not omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or
therein not misleading.

It is understood and agreed that the foregoing representations and warranties
shall survive the transfer of the Sold Receivables to Funding and any transfer
by Funding of any Sold Receivable or interest in any Sold Receivable by Funding
to any subsequent purchaser and shall continue so long as any Sold Receivable
shall remain outstanding.

         Section 4. BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; REPURCHASE OF SOLD
                    RECEIVABLES.

         Upon discovery by the Parent, Funding or (with respect to Sold
Receivables) any subsequent purchaser or its assignee of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 3 hereof which materially and
adversely affects the value of a Sold Receivable or the interests of Funding or
its assignees therein, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
written notice of such breach to the other parties. Thereafter, if requested by
notice from Funding or (with respect to Sold Receivables) any subsequent
purchaser, the Parent shall on the next succeeding Weekly Settlement Date
repurchase such Sold Receivable by remitting in the manner specified in such
notice the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable, provided, however, that if
the Parent fails to so remit the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable, Funding
shall offset such amount from any amount from the Sale Price to be paid on such
Weekly Settlement Date and any future Weekly Settlement Date until the entire
amount of such Outstanding Balance has been recovered by Funding. Any such
repurchase shall be made without recourse against, or warranty, express or
implied, of the transferee of such repurchased Receivable. Such transferee shall
execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignments as are necessary
to vest ownership of such Receivable in the Parent.

<PAGE>

         Section 5. INTENT OF THE PARTIES.

         It is the intention of the parties hereto that the purchase and sale of
Receivables from the Parent to Funding be treated for all purposes as a sale of
such Receivables and the proceeds thereof. However, if a court of competent
jurisdiction were to hold that the transaction evidenced hereby is not a
purchase, it is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall
constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and that the transactions
effected hereby shall be deemed to be secured financings in each case under
applicable law and, to that end, the Parent hereby grants to Funding a first
priority perfected security interest in all of the Parent's right, title and
interest in, to and under the following, whether now existing or hereafter
created: the Receivables and all documents and instruments executed pursuant
thereto, all collections on such Receivables, all other rights relating to and
payments made in respect of this Agreement, and all proceeds of any of the
foregoing.

         Section 6. INDEMNIFICATION.

         Without limiting any other rights that Funding, its assignee or any
director, officer, employer or agent thereof (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") may
have hereunder or under applicable law, the Parent hereby agrees to indemnify
each Indemnified Party from and against any and all claims, losses and
liabilities and related costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an
Indemnified Party in any way arising out of or resulting from this Sale
Agreement or the use by the Parent of the proceeds of any Sale Price or in
respect of any Sold Receivable, any Contract or any fees, costs or expenses
imposed on Funding under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, excluding, however,
(a) Indemnified Amounts to the extent resulting from gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party or (b) the uncollectability of
any Sold Receivable unrelated to a breach of a representation and warranty set
forth in Section 3 hereof (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to
as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS"). Without limiting or being limited by the foregoing,
the Parent shall pay on demand to each Indemnified Party any and all amounts
necessary to indemnify such Indemnified Party from and against any and all

         In addition, in order to facilitate the sale of the Receivables, in the
event Funding fails to pay any amounts owing by it pursuant to Section 8.1 or

that Funding may, and intends to, assign its rights hereunder pursuant to the
Receivables Purchase Agreement. The Parent agrees to reasonably cooperate with
Funding and its assignees to facilitate such assignments. This Sale Agreement

notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. This Sale Agreement and the
documents referred to herein embody the entire agreement of the Parent and
Funding with respect to the Sold Receivables and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings relating to the subject hereof. No failure on the part of the
Parent or Funding to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not

hereunder (as such, together with its successors and assigns, the

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                  WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell certain trade receivables

                  WHEREAS, the Administrative Agent has been requested and is

                                   ARTICLE II

                             PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES

         SECTION 2.1. FACILITY.

         The Purchaser may, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and in
its sole discretion, make Purchases of Receivables Interests from the Seller.
Purchases may be made until the occurrence of the Purchase Termination Date. The
Purchaser will not make any Purchase if, after giving effect to such Purchase,
the aggregate Capital Investment for all Receivables Interests hereunder would
exceed the Purchase Limit. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be or
construed as a commitment by the Purchaser to purchase any Receivables Interest.
In the event the Purchaser is not able to make a Purchase that it otherwise has
agreed to make solely as a result of a CP Disruption Event, the Purchaser will,
to the extent an advance is permitted to be made under the Liquidity Agreement,
request such an advance under the Liquidity Agreement and, upon receipt of the
proceeds of such advance, will make such Purchase in an amount equal to the
amount of such advance.

         SECTION 2.2. MAKING PURCHASES FROM THE SELLER.

         (a) Purchases that the Purchaser agrees to make will be made on
Purchase Dates. A Purchase will only be made if the Seller has delivered a
Request Notice to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day
immediately prior to the requested Purchase Date.

         (b) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Purchaser, will promptly
notify the Seller of the Purchaser's decision to make a Purchase or not to make
a Purchase and, if so, whether the amount specified by the Seller in the Request
Notice is acceptable to the Purchaser. Each notification will be made by
delivery of a Purchase Notification on the related Purchase Date to the Seller.

         (c) On the date of a Purchase, the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Purchaser shall, upon satisfaction of the Purchase Conditions, make
available to the Collection Account the Capital Investment for such Receivables
Interest (as set forth in related Purchase Notification, which amount may be
reduced by any amounts due under Sections 2.10, 8.1 or 10.3 that remain unpaid
on such day of Purchase) in same day funds, which amount shall be made
immediately available to the Seller at the account of the Seller specified in
writing to the Administrative Agent by the Seller from time to time.

         (d) Effective on the date of each Purchase pursuant to this Section
2.2, the Seller hereby sells and assigns to the Purchaser an undivided
percentage ownership interest, to the extent of the Receivables Interest then
being purchased, in each Pool Receivable then existing and in the Related
Security and Collections with respect thereto.

         SECTION 2.3. RECEIVABLES INTEREST.

         (a) The Administrative Agent will calculate the Receivables Interest
purchased on each Purchase Date and shall, on such Purchase Date, combine such
Receivables Interest, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4, with any
outstanding Receivables Interest and calculate the combined Receivable Interest,
after giving effect to the Purchase made on that Purchase Date, and notify the
Seller of the combined Receivables Interest in the Purchase Notification. The
undivided percentage interest of any Receivables Interest is equal to the
percentage equivalent of a fraction:

                                    CI + R
                                    ------
                                     NRPB

                              where:

                  CI       = the Capital Investment on the date the Receivables
                           Interest is calculated.

                  R        = the sum of the Applicable Margin Reserve, the
                           Dilution Reserve, the Fee Reserve and the Yield
                           Reserve, each on the date the Receivables Interest is
                           calculated.

                  NRPB     = The Net Receivables Pool Balance on the date the
                           Receivables Interest is calculated.

         (b) A Receivables Interest shall become zero on the later to occur of
(a) the date the Purchaser shall have (i) received the Accrued Daily Yield for
such Receivables Interest, plus any amount reasonably allocated by the
Administrative Agent in respect of the discount on Commercial Paper and the
interest on Liquidity Loans to mature after the date the Receivables Interest
becomes zero, (ii) recovered its Capital Investment and (iii) received all other
amounts payable to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) the date
the Servicer shall have received the accrued Servicing Fee for such Receivables
Interest. A Receivables Interest shall remain constant until the next Purchase
Date on which a Purchase is made and shall remain constant at all times on and
after the Purchase Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.4. DIVIDING OR COMBINING RECEIVABLES INTEREST.

         The Administrative Agent may at any time either (i) divide any
Receivables Interests into two or more Receivables Interests having aggregate
Capital Investment equal to the Capital Investment of such divided Receivables
Interest, or (ii) combine any two or more Receivables Interest into a single
Receivables Interest having Capital Investment equal to the aggregate of the
Capital Investment of such original Receivables Interests.

         SECTION 2.5. ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLECTION ACCOUNT.

         Prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Purchaser and the Administrative Agent shall establish an
Eligible Bank Account in the name of the Purchaser titled as specified in the
Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "COLLECTION ACCOUNT"). In addition, the
Administrative Agent shall establish and maintain a subaccount of the Collection
Account (the "ESCROWED AMOUNT SUBACCOUNT") into which all Escrowed Amounts shall
be deposited and retained until the expiration of the related Escrow Period.
Notwithstanding the agreement of any Obligor to deposit all amounts owing in
respect of the Pool Receivables directly to the Lockbox Account, each of the
Seller and the Servicer shall deposit all Collections it may receive in respect
of Pool Receivables into the Lockbox Account no later than the first Business
Day following the date of receipt thereof. Any Collections in respect of Pool
Receivables held by the Seller or the Servicer pending transfer to the
applicable Collection Account as provided in this Agreement shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Purchaser until such amounts are deposited into the
applicable Collection Account.

         SECTION 2.6. DETERMINATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a) The Administrative Agent's determinations and calculations made
under, or pursuant to, this Agreement shall in all cases be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

         (b) On each Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall determine the
amount of Collections received on Pool Receivables. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Purchaser, the Seller and the Servicer of its determinations
under this Section 2.6.

         SECTION 2.7. DEPOSITS TO THE COLLECTION ACCOUNT AND THE ESCROWED
AMOUNTS SUBACCOUNT.

         (a) On each Business Day all Collections in the Lockbox Account shall
be transferred by the Administrative Agent to the Collection Account.

         (b) On any Business Day, the Purchaser may deposit into the Collection
Account all or a portion of the net proceeds of Commercial Paper or of any
Liquidity Loan or any other funds available to the Purchaser for deposit.

         (c) Amounts in respect of the Escrowed Amounts shall be retained in the
Escrowed Amounts Subaccount until the expiration of the related Escrow Period at
which time such amounts shall be included in Available Funds and disbursed as
provided in Sections 2.8 and 2.9.

         SECTION 2.8. DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE COLLECTION ACCOUNT - REVOLVING
PERIOD.

         On each Business Day during the Revolving Period the Administrative
Agent shall allocate all Available Funds on deposit in the Collection Account in
the following priority (to the extent funds are available therefor):


                                       4

<PAGE>


         (a) an amount equal to Accrued Daily Yield shall be deposited into the
Collateral Account;

         (b) an amount equal to any Accrued Daily Servicing Fee due to any
Successor Servicer appointed hereunder shall be retained in the Collection
Account or if such Business Day is a Settlement Date, an amount equal to any
accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee due to the Successor Servicer through the end
of the related Settlement Period shall be paid to such Successor Servicer;

         (c) an amount equal to Accrued Daily Fees and Expenses shall be
deposited into the Collateral Account;

         (d) to the extent not paid pursuant to clause (b) above, an amount
equal to any Accrued Daily Servicing Fee due to the Servicer shall be retained
in the Collection Account or if such Business Day is a Settlement Date, an
amount equal to any accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee due to the Servicer through
the end of the related Settlement Period shall be paid to the Servicer;

         (e) that portion of the remaining amount up to the current Capital
Investment shall be deposited into the Collateral Account in reduction of such
Capital Investment or, if such Business Day is a Purchase Date, an amount up to
Capital Investment for the Receivables Interest to be purchased on such day, net
of amounts payable by the Seller pursuant to Sections 2.10, 8.1 and 10.3 or
otherwise hereunder (which shall be deposited into the Collateral Account or, to
the extent such amounts constitute Escrowed Amounts, retained in the Collection
Account until the expiration of the related Escrow Period), shall be paid on
behalf of the Purchaser to purchase any Receivables Interest to be purchased on
such Purchase Date;

         (f) if such Business Day is also a Settlement Date, an amount equal to
any unpaid amounts owing by the Seller pursuant to Sections 2.10, 8.1 and 10.3
or otherwise hereunder (other than Escrowed Amounts which shall be retained in
the Collection Account until the expiration of the related Escrow Period) shall
be deposited into the Collateral Account on behalf of the Purchaser; and

         (g) if such Business Day is also either a Settlement Date or a Purchase
Date, the balance in the Collection Account as of the end of such Settlement
Period shall be paid to the Seller.

         SECTION 2.9. LIQUIDATION SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES.

         On each Business Day on and after the Purchase Termination Date, the
Administrative Agent shall allocate all Available Funds on deposit in the
Collection Account in the following priority (to the extent funds are available
therefor):

         (a) to the Collateral Account, an amount equal to the sum of the
following:

                  (i) unpaid Accrued Daily Yield through and including such
         date;

                  (ii) the outstanding Capital Investment;

                                       5

<PAGE>


                  (iii) all unpaid amounts owing by the Seller to the Purchaser
         pursuant to Sections 2.10, 8.1 or 10.3 or otherwise hereunder (other
         than Escrowed Accounts which shall be retained in the Collection
         Account until the expiration of the Escrow Period); and

                  (iv) unpaid Accrued Daily Fees and Expenses through and
         including such date;

         (b) to any Successor Servicer, an amount equal to any accrued and
unpaid Servicing Fee owing to such Successor Servicer;

         (c) to the Servicer, an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid
Servicing Fee owing to the Servicer; and

         (d) the remaining balance shall be released to the Seller.

         SECTION 2.10. GENERAL SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES.

         If, on any day the Outstanding Balance of any Eligible Receivable is
reduced or canceled as a result of either (i) any event giving rise to a
Dilution or (ii) a setoff in respect of any claim by the Obligor thereof against
the Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (whether such claim arises out of the same
or a related transaction or an unrelated transaction), then, the Seller shall be
deemed to have received on such day a Collection of such Receivable in the
amount of such Dilution, reduction or cancellation. If, on any day the
representations and warranties in Section 4.2 of this Agreement are no longer
true with respect to any Pool Receivable, the Seller shall be deemed to have
received on such day a Collection of such Pool Receivable in full. The Seller or
the Servicer, on behalf of the Seller, no later than the fifteenth day after
such deemed receipt, shall deposit such amount to the Collection Account for
deposit to the Escrowed Amount Subaccount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if a Purchase
is made by the Purchaser during such 15-day period, the Purchaser shall reduce
the Cash Purchase Price otherwise payable by it for such Purchase by the amount
of any such deemed collection, which reduction shall constitute payment in full
of such deemed collection by the Seller. If and to the extent the Purchaser
shall be required for any reason to pay over to an Obligor, any bankruptcy
trustee of any Obligor, any Obligor as debtor-in-possession or otherwise any
amount received on the Purchaser's behalf hereunder, such amount shall be deemed
not to have been so received by the Purchaser, but rather to have been retained
by the Seller and, accordingly, the Purchaser shall have a claim against the
Seller for such amount, payable when and to the extent that any distribution
from or on behalf of such Obligor is made in respect thereof. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.10, or as otherwise required by applicable
law or the relevant Contract, all Collections received from an Obligor of any
Receivables shall be applied to the Receivables of such Obligor in the order of
the age of such Receivables, starting with the oldest such Receivable, unless
such Obligor designates its payment for application to specific Receivables.

         SECTION 2.11. INVESTMENT OF ACCOUNTS.

         Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.11, amounts on deposit in
the Collection Account (including any amounts held in the Escrowed Amount
Subaccount) shall be invested in Permitted Investments. Until the Purchase
Termination Date, to the extent there are uninvested amounts deposited in the
Collection Account (including any amounts held in the Escrowed Amount
Subaccount) in excess of the Minimum Investment Amount, the Administrative Agent
shall invest all such amounts in Permitted Investments selected by the
Purchaser, that mature no later than the immediately succeeding Purchase Date.
On and after the Purchase Termination Date, any investment of such amounts in
Permitted Investments shall be solely at the discretion of the Purchaser. All
investment earnings shall be disbursed in the same manner and priority as all
other amounts in the Collection Account except that net investment earnings on
the Escrowed Amount Subaccount shall be deposited into the Yield Subaccount of
the Collateral Account on behalf of the Purchaser.

         SECTION 2.12. AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.

         (a) The Administrative Agent shall provide written notice,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B, to the Seller, the Servicer and the
Purchaser of the determinations and disbursements made on each Business Day,
Purchase Date and Settlement Date pursuant to this Article 2.

         (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent is unable to obtain
information from the Seller or the Servicer with respect to any Receivable which
information is necessary for it to make the determinations set forth in Sections
2.6, 2.7 , 2.8, 2.9 or 2.10 there shall be a presumption that such Receivable
has not been paid and the Administrative Agent shall make the determinations set
forth in Section 2.6 and the allocations and distributions in Sections 2.8 and
2.9 based on such presumption. Upon such information becoming available, the
Administrative Agent shall take reasonable steps to recalculate the
determinations made subject to the presumption set forth above. The
Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to withdraw and disburse amounts from
the Lockbox Account and the Collection Account following the recalculation of
such determinations so as to achieve the same result as if disbursements of
amounts in such accounts had been made with knowledge of the correct information
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.13. CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT.

         It is the intention of the parties hereto that the purchase and sale of
Receivables Interests from the Seller to the Purchaser be treated for all
purposes as a sale of such Receivables Interests and the proceeds thereof.
However, if a court of competent jurisdiction were to hold that the transaction
evidenced hereby is not a purchase, it is the intention of the parties hereto
that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law,
and that the transactions effected hereby shall be deemed to be secured
financings in each case under applicable law and, to that end, the Seller grants
to the Purchaser a first priority perfected security interest in all of the
Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the following, whether now
existing or


                                       7

<PAGE>


hereafter created: the Receivables, the Receivables Sale Agreement and all
documents and instruments executed pursuant thereto, all Collections on such
Receivables, all amounts on deposit from time to time in the Lockbox Account and
the Collection Account, all other rights relating to and payments made in
respect of this Agreement, and all proceeds of any of the foregoing.



         SECTION 2.14. FURTHER ACTION EVIDENCING PURCHASES.

         (a) The Seller agrees that, from time to time, at its expense, it will
promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all
further action, that may be necessary or appropriate, or that the Purchaser or
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect, protect or
more fully evidence the transfer of ownership of the Pool Receivables or to
enable the Purchaser to exercise or enforce any of its rights hereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller will, upon the request of
the Purchaser, (i) execute and file such financing or continuation statements,
or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or appropriate, or as the Purchaser may reasonably
request, and (ii) segregate all invoices of Pool Receivables and indicate by
legend and in a conspicuous manner that such invoices relate to Pool
Receivables, an interest in which has been transferred to the Purchaser. The
manner by which the Servicer segregates and legends the invoices of Pool
Receivables is subject to approval by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Purchaser.

         (b) The Seller hereby authorizes the Purchaser to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto and assignments
thereof, relating to all or any of the Pool Receivables and Collections with
respect thereto without the signature of the Seller.

         SECTION 2.15. SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS.

         The Seller, the Originator, the Purchaser and the Administrative Agent
acknowledge that the parties are entering into the transactions described in
this Agreement in reliance on the Seller's identity as a separate legal entity
from the Originator. The Originator and the Seller agree to (a) maintain the
Seller's identity as a separate legal entity and (b) not to make any
representation to any third party as to the Seller's identity which might be
construed to be in conflict with the Seller's existence as an entity with assets
and liabilities distinct from those of the Originator.

         SECTION 2.16. ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.

         The Purchaser may from time to time unilaterally amend any of the
Schedules to this Agreement to reflect (a) in its judgment, the historical
experience of the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to Receivables, and (b)
criteria of eligibility of Receivables to be purchased under this Agreement.
Such amendment shall be made solely at the discretion of the Purchaser and shall
be effected by delivery by the Purchaser of a notice to each other party hereto
containing a copy of the revised Schedule or Schedules. The effective date of
such amendment shall be five Business Days after such delivery.

                                       8

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.17. PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

         (a) All amounts to be paid or deposited by the Seller or the Servicer
hereunder shall be paid or deposited no later than 11:00 A.M. on the day when
due in same day funds.

         (b) The Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall, to the
extent permitted by law, pay interest on any amount not paid or deposited by it
on the date when due hereunder, at an interest rate per annum equal to 2.0% per
annum above the Yield Discount, payable on demand.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Seller and the Servicer
agrees to calculate each Receivables Interest, the Capital Investment, the Net
Receivables Pool Balance and each of the Yield Reserve, the Fee Reserve, the
Applicable Margin Reserve and the Dilution Reserve, together with all subsidiary
calculations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Servicer in
writing of each such calculation. Unless the Servicer shall notify the
Administrative Agent in writing that such calculation is incorrect (and such
writing specifies the nature of such error), each such calculation made by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive.

         (d) All computations of interest under subsection (b) above shall be
made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.
Whenever any payment or deposit to be made hereunder shall be due on a day other
than a Business Day, such payment or deposit shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
computation of such payment or deposit.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             CONDITIONS TO PURCHASE

         (a) Without limiting any other rights that the Purchaser, the
Administrative Agent or any director, officer, employee or agent of such party
(each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") may have hereunder, or under applicable law, the
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any
and all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, and related costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) (other than taxes imposed or
measured by the net income of the Purchaser or any Administrative Agent in the
jurisdiction in which such party has its principal office), which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party in any way arising out
of or relating to any breach of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement,
excluding, however, Indemnified Amounts to the extent resulting solely from
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party
(all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS").
Without limiting or being limited by the foregoing, the Seller shall pay on
demand to each Indemnified Party any and all amounts necessary to indemnify such
Indemnified Party from and against any and all Indemnified Amounts relating to
or resulting from:

                  (i) reliance on any representation or warranty made or deemed
         made by the Seller (or any of its officers) under or in connection with
         this Agreement, any Related Document or any report or other information
         delivered by the Seller pursuant hereto or thereto which shall have
         been incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made or
         delivered; or

                  (ii) the failure by the Seller to comply with any term,
         provision or covenant contained in this Agreement, any Related Document
         or any agreement executed by it in connection with this Agreement or
         with any applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Pool
         Receivable or its related Contract, or the nonconformity of any Pool
         Receivable or its related Contract with any such applicable law, rule
         or regulation.

                                       23

<PAGE>


         (b) Any Indemnified Amounts subject to the indemnification provisions
of this Section 8.1 shall be paid to the Indemnified Party within five Business
Days following demand therefor.

         (c) The Seller certifies that it may assign the rights of indemnity
granted to it by the Originator under the Receivables Sale Agreement to the
Purchaser and the Purchaser may in turn assign such rights. The Seller hereby
assigns to the Purchaser such rights of indemnity. The Originator hereby
acknowledges such assignment and agrees that the Purchaser may enforce such
indemnities directly without joinder of the Seller.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 9.1. AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.

         The Administrative Agent may take such action and carry out such
functions under this Agreement as are specified by the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise contemplated hereby or thereby or are reasonably incidental thereto
or are delegated to it by the Purchaser under this Agreement or otherwise;
PROVIDED, that the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and any permissive
right of the Administrative Agent hereunder shall not be construed as a duty.

         SECTION 9.2. RELIANCE, ETC.

         None of the Administrative Agent, any Affiliate thereof nor any of
their respective directors, officers, agents or employees will be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with
this Agreement, or the Related Documents, except when caused solely by their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing or notwithstanding any term or provision hereof to the contrary, the
Seller, the Servicer and the Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Administrative Agent: (a) acts as agent hereunder for the Purchaser, and has no
duties or obligations to, will incur no liabilities or obligations to, and does
not act as an agent in any capacity for, the Seller or the Originator, (b) may

Documents on the part of the Seller, the Servicer or the Purchaser or to inspect
the property (including the books and records) of the Seller, the Servicer or
the Purchaser, (e) shall not be responsible to the Seller, the Servicer or the
Purchaser for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto (including the Related Documents), (f) shall
incur no liability under or in respect of this

                                       24

<PAGE>

Agreement or the Related Documents by acting upon any notice or communication
(including a communication by telephone), consent, certificate or other
instrument or writing believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or
communicated by the proper party or parties and (g) shall not be bound to make
any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any notice or other
communication hereunder and may rely on the accuracy of such facts or matters.

         SECTION 9.3. CAPITAL USA, L.L.C. AND AFFILIATES.

         Capital USA, L.L.C. and its Affiliates may generally engage in any kind
of business with the Seller, the Originator, the Servicer, the Purchaser or any
Obligor any of their respective Affiliates and any Person who may do business
with or own securities of such parties or any of their respective Affiliates,
all as if Capital USA, L.L.C. were not the Administrative Agent, and without the
duty to account therefor to the Seller, the Originator, the Servicer, the
Purchaser or any other Person.

         SECTION 9.4. COMMUNICATION WITH OBLIGORS.

         Each of the Seller, the Originator and the Servicer acknowledge and
agree that the Administrative Agent may confirm the status and outstanding

                                    ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 10.1. NOTICES, ETC.

         All notices and other communications provided for hereunder, unless
otherwise stated herein, shall be in writing and mailed or telecommunicated, or
delivered as to each party hereto, at its address set forth on Schedule 3 or at
such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to
the other parties hereto. All such notices and communications shall not be
effective until received by the party to whom such notice or communication is
addressed.

         SECTION 10.2. BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNABILITY; SURVIVAL.

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Seller, the Originator, the Servicer, the Purchaser, the Administrative Agent
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. None of the Seller, the
Originator or the Servicer may assign any of their rights and obligations
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser and the Administrative Agent. The Purchaser and the Administrative
Agent may, at any time, without the consent of the Seller, the Originator or the
Servicer assign any of their respective rights and obligations hereunder or
interest herein to any Person and, in such respect, specific references in this
Agreement to assignees of the Purchaser or the Administrative Agent are for
convenience only and not by way of limitation of such general rights. Any such
assignee may further assign at any time its rights and obligations hereunder or
interests herein without the

                                       25

<PAGE>

consent of the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby notifies the Seller, the
Originator and the Servicer that it intends to fund its purchases of Receivables
under this Agreement through the issuance of Commercial Paper and intends to
assign its interests hereunder to a collateral agent or trustee for the holders
of the Commercial Paper and the lenders or purchasers under the Liquidity
Agreement. The Seller, the Originator and the Servicer agree to reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser and the Administrative Agent in all matters
facilitating such assignments. This Agreement shall create and constitute the
continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and
shall remain in full force and effect until its termination; PROVIDED, that the
rights and remedies with respect to any breach of any representation and
warranty made by the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer pursuant to Article
IV and the indemnification and payment provisions of Article VIII shall be
continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.3. COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.

         (a) In addition to the rights of indemnification under Section 8.1
hereof, the Seller agrees to pay to the Purchaser, upon demand, the Seller's

expenses and taxes (other than taxes imposed or measured by the net income of
the Purchaser or any Administrative Agent in the jurisdiction in which the
Purchaser or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, has its principal
office) incurred by the Purchaser or the Administrative Agent in connection with
the administration (including periodic auditing, Rating Agency requirements,
modification and amendment) of this Agreement, the Related Documents and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Purchaser and the
Administrative Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the
Purchaser and the Administrative Agent as to its rights and remedies under this
Agreement, the Related Documents and the other agreements executed pursuant
hereto (collectively, "OTHER COSTS"). The Seller further agrees to pay within
five Business Days after demand all reasonable costs, counsel fees and expenses
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery and/or
enforcement (whether through negotiation, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the Related Documents and the other agreements and documents to
be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees
and expenses in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section
10.3; PROVIDED, however, that legal fees for the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related Documents shall not
exceed the amount set forth in the commitment letter (the "Cap"), expenses shall
be in addition to the Cap.

         (b) The Administrative Agent will notify the Seller of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement that will result in Other Costs as
promptly as practicable after the Administrative Agent obtains knowledge thereof
and will provide the Seller with a notice setting forth the basis and amount of
each such determination, which determination shall be conclusive.

         (c) If the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer fails to perform any
agreement or obligation contained herein, the Purchaser or the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement or obligation, and the

                                       26

<PAGE>

expenses of such party incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the
party which has failed to so perform upon such party's demand therefor.

         SECTION 10.4. CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law or unless the
Purchaser shall otherwise consent in writing, each of the Seller, the Originator
and the Servicer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement (and
all drafts hereof and documents ancillary hereto [and thereto]) in its
communications with third parties and otherwise and not to disclose, deliver or
otherwise make available to any third party (other than its directors, officers,
employees, accountants or counsel) the original or any copy of all or any part
of this Agreement (or any draft hereof and documents ancillary hereto).

         SECTION 10.5. NO PROCEEDINGS.

         The Seller, the Originator and the Servicer each hereby agree that it
will not, directly or indirectly, institute, or cause to be instituted, against
the Purchaser or the general partner of the Purchaser any proceeding of the type
referred to in Section 7.1(c) so long as there shall not have elapsed one year
plus one day since the latest maturing Commercial Paper have been paid in full
in cash. The Originator, the Servicer, the Purchaser and the Administrative
Agent each hereby agree that it will not, directly or indirectly, institute, or
cause to be instituted, against the Seller any proceeding of the type referred
to in Section 7.1(c) so long as there shall not have elapsed one year plus one
day since the termination of this Agreement. The requirements of this Section
10.5 shall survive the termination and assignment of this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall provide the Originator with written notice of the
maturity date of such latest maturing Commercial Paper.

         SECTION 10.6. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; CONSENTS; REMEDIES.

         No modification, amendment or waiver of or with respect to any
provision of this Agreement, the Related Documents or any other agreements,
instruments and documents delivered pursuant hereto, nor consent to any
departure by the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer from any of the terms or
conditions thereof, shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed
by each of the parties hereto. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No consent to or
demand on the Seller, the Originator or the Servicer in any case shall, in
itself, entitle it to any other consent or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances. This Agreement, the Related Documents and the documents
referred to therein embody the entire agreement among the Seller, the Purchaser,
the Originator, the Administrative Agent and the Servicer and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject hereof. No failure
on the part of the Purchaser or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies
herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided
by law.

                                       27

<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.7. SEVERABILITY.

         In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby in such jurisdiction and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, shall
not be impaired thereby in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 10.8. DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS.

         The descriptive headings of the various sections of this Agreement are
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to affect the

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LASER

                  Laser hereby makes the same representations and warranties to
Parent Holdings and Holdings as the representations and warranties made by Laser
to the Company in the Company Merger Agreement, and also represents and warrants
to Parent Holdings and Holdings as follows:

                   Section 5.1. LASER MERGER SUB. Laser Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware. Laser Merger Sub is a newly incorporated company
formed solely for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has engaged in no activity other than as provided in, or
contemplated by, this Agreement. The authorized capital stock of Laser Merger
Sub consists of 1,000 shares of Laser Merger Sub Common Stock, all of which are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and
are owned by Laser. Except as set forth above there are no shares of capital
stock of Laser Merger Sub issued or outstanding or any options, warrants,
subscription, calls, rights, convertible securities or other agreements or
commitments obligating Laser Merger Sub to issue, transfer, sell, redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or securities.

                   Section 5.2. AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each of
Laser and Laser Merger Sub has the corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, if a party thereto, the Registration Rights
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, if a party thereto,
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and, if a
party thereto, thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, thereby and by the Company Merger Agreement,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Laser
and Laser Merger Sub and no other corporate action on the part of Laser or Laser
Merger Sub (including on the part of their respective stockholders) is required
to authorize the execution, delivery and performance hereof or thereof and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Laser and Laser Merger Sub and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Laser and Laser Merger Sub,
assuming it is the valid and binding obligation of Parent Holdings and Holdings,
enforceable against Laser and Laser Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
except 


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

that such enforcement may be subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to creditors' rights generally and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and the discretion of the court before which any
proceedings therefore may be brought. Prior to the Holdings Effective Time, the
Registration Rights Agreement will have been duly executed and delivered by
Laser and, assuming that it constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
Parent Holdings, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of Laser
enforceable against Laser in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforcement may be subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally and the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings
therefor may be brought.

                   Section 5.3. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. Except
for applicable requirements of the HSR Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, Competition Laws and state securities or blue sky Laws, no filing with, and
no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental or regulatory
authority is necessary for the consummation by Laser and Laser Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such filings, permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to be made or
obtained would not (i) individually or in the aggregate have a Laser Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) delay in any material respect or prevent the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Laser and Laser Merger Sub nor the
consummation by Laser and Laser Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Laser and Laser Merger Sub with any of the provisions
hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Laser or Laser Merger Sub; (b) result
in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Contract or of any license, franchise, permit, concession, certificate of
authority, order, approval, application or registration of, from or with any
Governmental Entity to which Laser or Laser Merger Sub is a party or by which
either of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound; or (c) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to
Laser, Laser Merger Sub or any of their properties or assets, except, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c), for violations, breaches or defaults which would
not individually or in the aggregate have a Laser Material Adverse Effect.

                   Section 5.4. ACQUISITION OF SHARES FOR INVESTMENT. Laser is
acquiring the Holdings Shares for its own account for investment purposes only
and not with a view toward or for a sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling any of such in
violation of federal or state securities laws.

                   (j) take any action that would make any representation or

hereof or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

                   (k) enter into any agreement or commitment to take any of the
foregoing actions.

Agreement and the Company Merger Agreement prior to the Holdings Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties hereto nor Worldwide nor the

the parties hereto shall make or cause to be made all filings and submissions

                   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement

exchange or other retirement in full of the LYONs, Laser shall cause to be paid
to Parent Holdings all amounts remaining in the LYONs Escrow Fund by wire

have been any event, change or development which individually or in the
aggregate has had or reasonably would be expected to have a Laser Material
Adverse Effect or would impair the ability of Laser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to satisfy its obligations
hereunder.

                   (d) The Registration Rights Agreement shall have been duly
executed and delivered by each of the parties thereto.

                   Section 8.3. CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF LASER TO EFFECT THE
HOLDINGS MERGER. The obligation of Laser to effect the Holdings Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction by Holdings and Parent Holdings or waiver by Laser,
to the extent permitted by Law, at or prior to the Holdings Effective Time of
the following additional conditions, unless:

                   (a) The representations and warranties of Holdings and Parent
Holdings in this Agreement and the representations of the Company in the Company
Merger Agreement that are qualified as to materiality shall be true and correct,
and the representations and warranties of Holdings and Parent Holdings in this
Agreement and the representations of the Company in the Company Merger Agreement
shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the date
hereof, and, except to the extent such representations and warranties refer to a
specific date, as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing
Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this condition shall be deemed satisfied unless
the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct (disregarding for this purpose all qualifications in such
representations and warranties relating to materiality or knowledge), in the
aggregate, would have a Holdings Material Adverse Effect or Company Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in the Company Merger Agreement), as the case may be.

                   (b) Parent Holdings and Holdings shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by them under this

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TAX MATTERS

                   Section 9.1. TAXES.

                   (a) Parent Holdings shall indemnify and hold Laser and
Laser's subsidiaries and Affiliates harmless from and against the following:

                             (i) any liability for Taxes of any member of the
         "affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code)
         (except for the Company and its subsidiaries) of which Mafco Holdings
         Inc. (or any predecessor or successor) is the common parent that arises
         under the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
         successor provision) or comparable provisions of foreign, state or
         local law; and

                             (ii) except to the extent provided in Section
         9.1(b)(iii), any liability for Taxes (other than Taxes that arise under
         the provisions of Treasury Regulatory Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
         successor provision) or comparable provisions of foreign, state or
         local law) imposed on Holdings or Worldwide or for which Holdings or
         Worldwide may otherwise be liable for any Pre-Closing Period
         (including, without limitation, any Taxes resulting from Holdings or
         Worldwide ceasing to be a member of the "affiliated group" of which
         Mafco Holdings Inc. (or any successor) is the common parent, any income
         Taxes that arise in the Holdings Merger, and any Taxes imposed on
         Holdings or Worldwide as a result of any transaction effected between
         (and including) the date hereof and the Closing Date).

                   (b) Laser shall indemnify and hold Parent Holdings and its
Affiliates harmless from and against the following:

                             (i)  Taxes imposed on Holdings or Worldwide for 
         any Post-Closing Period;

                             (ii) except to the extent provided in Section
         9.1(a)(i), any liability for Taxes of the Company and any of its
         subsidiaries; and

                             (iii) any liability for Taxes resulting from
         transactions or actions taken by Holdings or Worldwide on the Closing
         Date but after the Holdings Effective Time, except for transactions or
         actions undertaken in the ordinary course of business.

                   (c) To the extent permitted by law or administrative
practice, (i) the taxable year of Holdings or Worldwide which includes the
Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date and
(ii) all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring after the
Holdings Effective Time shall be reported on Laser's consolidated United States
federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall be similarly reported on other Tax Returns of
Laser or its Affiliates to 


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

the extent permitted by Law. For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b)(i), where it
is necessary to apportion between Parent Holdings and Laser the Tax liability of
an entity for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately
preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date), such liability shall be
apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date
and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing
Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except that Taxes (such as
real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily
basis.

                   (d) For purposes of Sections 9.1(a) and (b), whenever it is
necessary to allocate an item of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit to
either a taxable year or period that is not part of a Straddle Period and that
ends on or before the Closing Date or a taxable year or period that is not part
of a Straddle Period and that begins after the Closing Date, such allocation
shall be made consistent with the Law.

                   (e) Any real property transfer or gains Tax, sales Tax, use
Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on Holdings or
any of its subsidiaries arising out of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the party primarily obligated
for such Tax under applicable Law, and each party shall indemnify the other
party for any such Tax for which it is so liable.

                   (f) (i) Except as set forth in Section 9.1(f)(iii), Laser
shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes or the benefit of the utilization of
any Tax attribute (including, without limitation, any net operating loss,
investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, or other credit or deduction) of (x)
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (y) for a Post-Closing Period,
Holdings or Worldwide . If Parent Holdings or any of its Affiliates or
subsidiaries receives any refund of Tax to which Laser is entitled pursuant to
this Section 9.1(f)(i) or utilizes any Tax attribute to which Laser is entitled
pursuant to this Section 9.1(f)(i), Parent Holdings shall promptly notify Laser
and shall pay the amount of such refund or the benefit realized from such
utilization within five (5) days of the receipt of such refund or the
realization of such benefit.

                             (ii) Except as set forth in Section 9.1(f)(iii),
         Parent Holdings shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes or the benefit
         of the utilization of any Tax attribute of Holdings or Worldwide for a
         Pre-Closing Period. If Laser or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries
         receives any refund of Tax to which Parent Holdings is entitled
         pursuant to this Section 9.1(f)(ii) or utilizes any Tax attribute to
         which Parent Holdings is entitled pursuant to this Section 9.1(f)(ii),
         Laser shall promptly notify Parent Holdings and shall pay the amount of
         such refund or the benefit realized from such utilization within five
         (5) days of the receipt of such refund or the realization of such
         benefit.

                             (iii) No payment shall be made in respect of a Tax
         deduction, Tax credit or other Tax benefit pursuant to this Section
         9.1(f) in duplication of payments previously made in respect of the
         same Tax deduction, Tax credit or other Tax benefit.

                   (g) Any indemnity payment required under this Article IX as a
result of an adjustment shall be paid seven (7) days after a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Any payment required to be
made under this Article IX by one party to the 


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

other party that is not made on or before the date specified in this Article IX
shall bear interest after such date at the rate specified in Code Section
6621(a)(2) for underpayments.

                   Section 9.2. TAX RETURNS. (a) Parent Holdings shall file or
cause to be filed when due (i) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed on
or before the Closing Date by or with respect to Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries and (ii) all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to Parent Holdings or any entity that
will be its Affiliate after the Holdings Merger, on the one hand, and Holdings
or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, for taxable years or periods that
include or precede the Closing Date. Parent Holdings shall remit (or cause to be
remitted) any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. In the case of Tax Returns
described in clause (ii) above, Laser shall pay Parent Holdings no later than
five (5) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax
Return the Tax in connection with such Tax Return for which Laser is liable
pursuant to this Article IX (or Parent Holdings shall pay Laser on such date the
excess, if any, of any estimated Tax payments by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, relating to the period covered by such Tax Return, over the Tax in
connection with such Tax Return for which Laser is liable pursuant to this
Article IX). Holdings and its subsidiaries shall cooperate in the preparation of
any Tax Returns for which Parent Holdings has filing responsibility hereunder.
Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing in a timely
manner return preparation packages in the form and of the quality provided prior
to the Holdings Merger. Such packages shall be prepared in good faith in a
manner consistent with past practice.

                   (b) Laser shall file or cause to be filed when due all other
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to Holdings or any
of its subsidiaries. Laser shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns. Parent Holdings shall pay Laser no later than five
(5) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax Return the
Tax in connection with such Tax Return for which Parent Holdings is liable
pursuant to this Article IX.

                   (c) The party with filing responsibility under this Section
9.2 for a Tax Return shall, 20 days prior to the due date (including extensions)
of such Tax Return, present to the other party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") for
the approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the
Indemnifying Party the portion, if any, of the Tax Return reflecting solely the
items and positions for which the Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to this
Article IX.

                   (d) From and after the date hereof, Parent Holdings and each
of its Affiliates shall not amend any Tax Return with respect to Taxes for which
Laser or any of its Affiliates is liable pursuant to this Agreement, without the
written consent of Laser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                   (e) From and after the date hereof, any payment (including
any estimated payment) in respect of Taxes pursuant to a Tax Sharing Arrangement
that includes Holdings or any of its subsidiaries shall be reduced by any
payment that would be owed by the other party pursuant to a Tax Sharing
Arrangement.

                   Section 9.3. TAX CLAIMS.

                   (a) In the case of any Tax audit, examination or judicial or
administrative proceeding (a "TAX PROCEEDING") relating to a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes Mafco Holdings Inc. (or any
predecessor or successor thereto), Laser shall be entitled to control the
portion of the Tax Proceeding, if any, relating solely to items for which Laser
is liable pursuant to this Agreement, and Parent Holdings shall be entitled to
control every other portion of the Tax Proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither Parent Holdings nor any of its Affiliates shall settle or otherwise
dispose of any issue in any such Tax Proceeding that could materially affect the
Tax liability hereunder of Laser, without the prior written consent of Laser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Parent Holdings shall be
entitled to control the Pre-Closing Period portion of a Tax Proceeding relating
to a Straddle Period Tax Return, or a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period ending
before the Closing Date, of Holdings or Worldwide; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
neither Parent Holdings nor any of its Affiliates shall settle or otherwise
dispose of any issue in any such Tax Proceeding that could materially affect the
Tax liability hereunder of Laser, without the prior written consent of Laser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                   (b) Parent Holdings or Laser, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any tax claim that could result in
liability of the other party under this Agreement (a "TAX Claim"). With respect
to any Tax Claim, the party controlling the Tax Proceeding with respect thereto
shall (i) not make any submission to any taxing authority without offering the
other party the opportunity to review it, (ii) keep the other party informed as
to the progress of such Tax Claim, (iii) provide the other party with any
information that it receives in connection with the Tax Proceeding, (iv) permit
the other party to participate (at its own expense) in all conferences, meetings
or proceedings with any taxing authority in which the indemnified Tax Claim is
or may be a subject, and (v) permit the other party to participate (at its own
expense) in all court appearances in which the indemnified Tax Claim is or may
be a subject. With respect to any Tax Claim, the party not controlling the Tax
Proceeding with respect thereto shall not take any action or make any
representations in connection with such Tax Claim with respect to issues
affecting the other party's indemnity hereunder. With respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Pre-Closing Period for which Laser is or may be liable pursuant to
this Agreement, Parent Holdings or any of its Affiliates shall either file (or
cause to be filed) submissions at Laser's direction or appoint (or cause to be
appointed) Laser or its authorized representatives as additional authorized
representatives entitled to communicate fully with the Internal Revenue Service
or the appropriate state, local or foreign taxing authority with respect to such
Tax Claim.

                   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 9.3 shall be construed
as limiting any party's right to indemnification under Section 9.1.

                   Section 9.4. ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing
Date, each of Parent Holdings and Laser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):

be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described
in Section 9.1(e) (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);

                   (b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
Section 9.2;

                   (c) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of Holdings and each
of its subsidiaries;

                   (d) make available to the other and to any taxing authority
as reasonably requested in connection with any Tax Return described in Section
9.4(b) or any proceeding described in Section 9.4(c), all information relating
to any Taxes or any Tax Returns of Holdings and each of its subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, records, returns, schedules, documents, work
papers or other relevant materials;

                   (e) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any Tax
audits or assessments of Holdings and each of its subsidiaries that are pending
or proposed in writing for taxable periods for which the other may have a
liability under this Article IX; and

                   (f) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such taxable period.

                   Section 9.5. ADJUSTMENT TO MERGER CONSIDERATION. For all Tax
purposes, any payment by Laser or Parent Holdings under this Agreement will be
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

                   Section 9.6. SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and notwithstanding Article X of
this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this Article IX
shall be unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect until 90 days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

                   Section 9.7. REORGANIZATION. Laser shall not, and shall not
permit any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates to, take any action that could
prevent the Holdings Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Laser and Parent Holdings shall treat,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to treat, the Holdings Merger as a
reorganization for all Tax and reporting purposes.

                   Section 9.8. TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All rights and
obligations of Parent Holdings (and the entities that will be its Affiliates
after the Holdings Effective Time) pursuant to any of the Tax Sharing
Arrangements or any Tax indemnity arrangements involving Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries will terminate on the Closing Date.

                   Section 9.9. INFORMATION. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement or the Company Merger Agreement, neither Laser nor any of its
Affiliates nor any other Person shall have any right to receive or obtain any
information relating to Taxes of Parent Holdings or any of its Affiliates other
than information relating solely to Holdings or any of its subsidiaries.

                   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X,

hold harmless Laser and its subsidiaries (including after the Closing Date, the
Company and its subsidiaries) and each of their respective successors and
permitted assigns, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents,
Affiliates and associates (collectively, the "LASER Group") from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
claims and damages (collectively, "DAMAGES") asserted against, resulting to,
imposed upon or suffered by the Laser Group, or any one of them, arising out of
or related to any liability or obligation of Holdings or Worldwide existing on
or prior to the Closing Date other than any such liability or obligation (i)
arising in connection with the Notes, the LYONs and the 1998 Notes, (ii) which
is also a liability or obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries (on a joint
basis or otherwise), or (iii) which relates to the conduct, operations or
activities of the Company or its subsidiaries.

                   (b) If there are any conflicts between the provisions of this
Section 10.1 and Section 9.3 with respect to Tax Claims, the provisions of
Section 9.3 shall control.

                   (c) Any payment by Parent Holdings under Article IX or this
Section 10.1 will be an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

                   (d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the liability of Parent Holdings to indemnify the Laser Group
pursuant to this Section 10.1 against any Damages sustained by reason of any
Laser Claim shall be limited to Laser Claims as to which the Laser Group has
given Parent Holdings written notice, setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such Laser Claim, on or prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the
Closing Date.

                   Section 10.2. CONDITIONS OF INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO
THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. The obligations and liabilities of Parent Holdings with

third parties ("THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS") shall be subject to the following
conditions:

                   (a) The Laser Group shall give Parent Holdings prompt notice
of any such Third-Party Claim, and Parent Holdings shall have the right to
undertake the defense thereof by representatives chosen by it; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that failure to provide prompt notice shall not 


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

affect Parent Holdings' obligations hereunder except to the extent that Parent
Holdings is actually prejudiced by such failure;

                   (b) If Parent Holdings undertakes the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim, the Laser Group shall, to the best of its ability, assist

Parent Holdings, copies of any documents received by the Laser Group which
relate to such Third-Party Claim;

                   (c) If Parent Holdings, within a reasonable time after notice

compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the
account and risk of Parent Holdings, subject to the right of Parent Holdings to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination thereof; and

                   (d) Anything in this Article X to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party
Claim may materially and adversely affect the Laser Group other than as a result
of money damages or other money payments, the Laser Group shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party
Claim, and shall by doing so release Parent Holdings from any liability to
provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (ii) Parent
Holdings shall not, without the written consent of the Laser Group, settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
the plaintiff to the Laser Group a release from all liability with respect to
such Third-Party Claim.

at any time prior to the Holdings Effective Time:

                  (a)  by mutual written agreement of Laser and Holdings;

                  (b) by either Laser or Holdings if the Holdings Merger shall

whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date;

                  (c) by either Laser or Holdings if a court of competent
jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which
order, decree or ruling the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
lift), in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

the other party or any of its subsidiaries (including, in the case of Holdings,
the Company and its subsidiaries) of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement or the Company Merger Agreement, as
applicable, which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a) hereof or Section 8.1 thereof, as applicable,
and is not capable of being cured (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement).

                   Section 11.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11.1 hereof, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, provided that the last sentence of Section 6.7 and
Article XII shall continue, and there shall be no liability on the part of any
of the parties, nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach hereof.

provisions of this Agreement by such party, the other party hereto shall be
entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other
security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific

which shall have become payable with respect to such shares of Laser Common
Stock between the Company Effective Time and the time of such surrender. In no
event shall the person entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive
interest on such dividends. If any certificates for any shares of Laser Common
Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such shares of Laser
Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable
to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any shares of Laser Common
Stock or dividends thereon, any cash payments to be made pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(i)(B) hereof or, in accordance with Section 3.4 hereof, any cash in lieu
of fractional share interests, in each case, delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable escheat Laws and (ii) any shares of Laser Common Stock
held by the Exchange Agent prior to surrender of certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock shall not be deemed issued.

                  Section 3.4 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Laser Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Article III, and no dividend, stock split or other change
in the capital structure of Laser shall relate to any fractional security, and
such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a security holder. In lieu of any such fractional shares of Laser
Common Stock, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Laser Common Stock upon surrender
of stock certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article III will be paid
cash upon such surrender in an amount equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the closing sale price of one share of Laser Common Stock on the
NYSE on the day of the Company Effective Time, or, if shares of Laser Common
Stock are not so traded on such day, the closing sale price of one such share on
the next preceding day on which such share was traded on the NYSE. For purposes
of this Section 3.4, shares of Company Common Stock of any holder represented by
two or more certificates shall be aggregated, and in no event shall any holder
be paid an amount of cash pursuant to this Section 3.4 in respect of more than
one share of Laser Common Stock.

                  Section 3.5 TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Common
Stock for six (6) months after the Company Effective Time shall be delivered to
Laser, upon demand, and any holders of the Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Laser
for payment of their claim for the shares of Laser Common Stock and cash and
dividends or other distributions, if any, pursuant to this Article III.

                  Section 3.6 INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. Without prejudice to
the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Laser, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Laser.

                  Section 3.7 CLOSING OF COMPANY TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Company
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Company Effective Time, certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable thereto.

                  Section 3.8 DISSENTING SHARES. Each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock as to which a written demand for appraisal is filed in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and not withdrawn, and with respect to
which a consent is not given in favor of the Company Merger shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, the right to appraisal of and
payment for each such share of Company Common Stock under Section 262, at which
time each such share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. All such shares of Company

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

Common Stock as to which such a written demand for appraisal is so filed and not
withdrawn and with respect to which a consent is not given in favor of the
Company Merger, except any such shares of Company Common Stock the holder of
which, prior to the Company Effective Time, shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right to appraisal and payment for such shares of Company Common Stock
under Section 262, are herein referred to as "DISSENTING SHARES." The Company
shall give Laser prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any written
demands for appraisal rights, withdrawal of such demands, and any other written
communications delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 262, and the Company
shall give Laser the opportunity, to the extent permitted by Law, to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with
the prior written consent of Laser, the Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal rights and shall not settle or
offer to settle any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes
entitled, pursuant to the provisions of Section 262, to payment for such shares
of Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 shall receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation and such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be cancelled thereafter.

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and there has
not been any event, change or development which individually or in the aggregate

two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to each Company Plan (if any such report was required), (y)
the most recent summary plan description for each Company Plan for which such
summary plan description is required and (z) each currently effective trust
agreement, insurance or group annuity contract and each other material funding
or financing arrangement relating to any Company Plan.

                  (b) No Commonly Controlled Entity has incurred any liability
under Title IV of ERISA, other than for contributions not yet due to a defined
benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and other than for the payment
of premiums to the PBGC not yet due, and no condition exists that presents a
material risk of incurring any such liability, which liability, to the extent
currently due, has not been fully paid as of the date hereof and would
individually or in the aggregate be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Except as set forth in Company SEC reports or in Section
4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any welfare benefits to employees or
former employees following termination of employment except (i) for benefits the
cost of which is borne entirely by the employee or former employee, (ii) as
required under Section 4980 of the Code or other applicable law or (iii)
obligations to provide such benefits to Company employees employed in non-U.S.

jurisdictions.

                  (d) No Commonly Controlled Entity has engaged in a transaction
described in Section 4069 of ERISA that could subject the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or Laser to liability at any time after the date hereof, which
liability would be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (e) No Commonly Controlled Entity has withdrawn from any
multiemployer plan where such withdrawal has resulted in any actual or potential
"withdrawal liability" (as defined in Section 4201 of ERISA) that has not been
fully paid, which liability would be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as specifically provided in this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
connection with another event, cause there to be paid or become payable any
additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
benefits under any Company Plan or under any employment, severance, termination
or compensation agreement to which the Company is a party as of the Company
Effective Time.

                  (a) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Reports, the
Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws, which compliance includes the possession of permits and governmental
authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws ("ENVIRONMENTAL
PERMITS") and compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, except where
such non-compliance would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Reports,
there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that would reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Reports, the
properties presently or to the knowledge of the Company formerly owned, leased
or operated by the Company or its subsidiaries (including groundwater under the
properties) (the "PROPERTIES") do not contain any Hazardous Substance other than
as permitted under applicable Environmental Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with
respect to Properties formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or its
subsidiaries, such representation is limited to the period prior to the
disposition of such Properties by the Company or its subsidiaries.

                  (d) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Reports, to
the knowledge of the Company, no Hazardous Substance has been disposed of or
transported from any of the Properties during the time any such Property was
owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than
as permitted under applicable Environmental Law and in effect at the time of
such disposal or transportation.

                  (e) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Reports, to
the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its subsidiaries have not become
obligated, whether by operation of Law or through contractual agreement, to
indemnify any other person or otherwise to assume liability for any claim
brought pursuant to any Environmental Law which could reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 4.15 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Company has
previously delivered to Laser a list, which, to the knowledge of the Company, is
true and correct as of the date hereof in all material respects, of all material
issued patents and registered trademarks of the Company. Except as set forth in
Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its
subsidiaries own or have sufficient rights to use all material Intellectual
Property used in connection with the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries as currently conducted. As used in this Section 4.15, the term
"material," when applied to Intellectual Property, means that such Intellectual
Property is used in a significant manner to conduct the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries as it is currently conducted.

                  Section 4.16 CONTRACTS. Except as set forth in Section 4.16
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to or bound by

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

any material Contract, other than (i) the Affiliate Agreements listed in Section
4.10 of the Holdings Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any Contract filed or
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any Filed Company SEC Report or (iii)
any Contract (other than the Affiliate Agreements listed in Section 4.10 of the
Holdings Disclosure Schedule) entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

                  Section 4.17 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of
Directors of the Company has received the opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston,
dated the date hereof to the effect that the Per Share Merger Consideration is
fair to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Worldwide)
from a financial point of view.

                  Section 4.18 TAKEOVER STATUTE. The Board of Directors of the
Company has approved the Holdings Merger solely for the purpose of rendering
inapplicable, and such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable, to the
Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. To the best of the Company's knowledge,
no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or
purports to apply to the Company Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or certificates of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of any subsidiary of the
Company would, directly or indirectly, restrict or impair the ability of Laser
to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to,
shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that may be
acquired or controlled by Laser.

                  Section 4.19 BROKERS. No broker, investment banker or other
person, other than Credit Suisse First Boston, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by the Company (as reflected in an agreement between Credit Suisse
First Boston and the Company, a copy of which has been furnished to Laser), is
entitled to any broker's, finder's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LASER AND MERGER SUB

                  Laser and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

                  Section 5.1 ORGANIZATION. Laser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware and has the corporate power to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Laser is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations or financial condition of Laser and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (a "LASER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT").

                                      -21-

                  Section 5.2 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of
Laser consists of 200,000,000 shares of Laser Common Stock, and 2,000,000 shares
of Laser Preferred Stock. As of February 23, 1998, (i) 85,988,627 shares of
Laser Common Stock were issued and outstanding; (ii) 16,129,197 shares of Laser
Common Stock were issuable upon exercise of employee and non-employee stock
options (the "LASER STOCK OPTIONS") outstanding under all stock option plans of
Laser (the "LASER STOCK OPTION PLANS") or granted pursuant to employment
agreements; and (iii) no shares of Laser Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding. As of such date, 4,568,959 shares of Laser Common Stock were held
as treasury shares. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Laser Common
Stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. All of the shares of Laser Common Stock issuable as consideration in the
Company Merger at the Company Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement
will be, when so issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of such date, except as set
forth above, there are no shares of capital stock of Laser issued or outstanding
or, as of such date or as of the date hereof, except as set forth above, any
options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights, convertible securities or other
agreements or commitments obligating Laser to issue, transfer, sell, redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or securities,
or the capital stock or securities of Laser. There are no notes, bonds,
debentures or other indebtedness of Laser having the right to vote (or
convertible into or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) on any
matters upon which stockholders of Laser may vote.

                  Section 5.3 MERGER SUB. Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. Merger Sub is a newly incorporated company formed solely for purposes
of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged
in no activity other than as provided in, or contemplated by, this Agreement.
The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned by Laser. Except as set forth above there are no shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub issued or outstanding or any options, warrants,
subscription, calls, rights, convertible securities or other agreements or
commitments obligating Merger Sub to issue, transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase
or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or securities.

                  Section 5.4 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each of
Laser and Merger Sub has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Laser and Merger Sub and the consummation by Laser and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Boards of
Directors of Laser and Merger Sub, and no other corporate action or proceedings
on the part of Laser or Merger Sub (including any action on the part of its
stockholders) is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Laser and Merger Sub and, assuming it is a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Laser and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Laser and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforcement may be subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to creditors' rights generally and other forms of

                                      -22-

equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and the discretion of the
court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought.

                  Section 5.5 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. Except for
applicable requirements of the HSR Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
Competition Laws, and state securities or blue sky Laws, and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL, no filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any governmental or regulatory authority
is necessary for the consummation by Laser or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for such filings, permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to be made or
obtained would not (i) individually or in the aggregate have a Laser Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) delay in any material respect or prevent the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Laser or Merger Sub nor the consummation by
Laser or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by
Laser with any of the provisions hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Laser
or Merger Sub; (b) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material (as defined for purposes of Form 10-K)
Contract to which Laser, Merger Sub or any of their subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound; or (c)
violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Laser, Merger Sub, any of their subsidiaries or any of their
properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), for
violations, breaches or defaults which would not individually or in the
aggregate have a Laser Material Adverse Effect.

                  (a) Laser has filed all reports, forms, registrations,

requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Except to the

REPORTS"), none of the Filed Laser SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (b) The consolidated financial statements of Laser included
in the Filed Laser SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

                                      -23-

involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly
present the consolidated financial position of Laser and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein).

                  (c) Except as set forth in the Filed Laser SEC Reports and
except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of the most recent
consolidated balance sheet included in the Filed Laser SEC Reports (the "LASER
BALANCE SHEET DATE"), neither Laser nor any of the Laser subsidiaries has any
material liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be recognized or disclosed on a
consolidated balance sheet of Laser and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the
notes thereto.

                  Section 5.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as
set forth in the Filed Laser SEC Reports, since the Laser Balance Sheet Date,
the business of Laser and its subsidiaries has been conducted only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and there has not
been any event, change or development which individually or in the aggregate has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Laser Material Adverse Effect or
would impair or delay the ability of Laser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, or to satisfy its obligations under, this Agreement.

                  Section 5.8 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Filed
Laser SEC Reports, there is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending
or, to the knowledge of Laser, threatened against or affecting Laser or any of
its subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to (i) have a Laser Material Adverse Effect (taking into account any
reserve therefor as of the most recent balance sheet included in the Filed Laser
SEC Reports) or (ii) delay in any material respect or prevent the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any
judgment, order, decree, statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Laser or any of its
subsidiaries having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, any effect
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above.

                  Section 5.9 INFORMATION IN DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS AND
REGISTRATION STATEMENT. None of the information to be supplied by Laser for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement or (b)
the Information Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Section 14(f) Notice will,
in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and
at the Company Effective Time contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of the Information
Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 and the Section 14(f) Notice, at the time of the
mailing thereof and, in the case of the Information Statement and the Schedule
13E-3, at the Company Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

The Registration Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Schedule 13E-3 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

                  (b) all material Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax

which Laser or any of its subsidiaries is presently contesting in good faith, an
adequate reserve has been established for such Taxes in accordance with GAAP.

                  Section 5.11 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. Except as
disclosed in the Filed Laser SEC Reports, Laser and its subsidiaries have
received such certificates, permits, licenses, franchises, consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations and clearances from appropriate Governmental Entities
(the "LASER LICENSES") as are necessary to own or lease and operate their
respective properties and to conduct their respective businesses substantially
in the manner described in the Laser SEC Reports and as currently owned or
leased and conducted, and all such Laser Licenses are valid and in full force
and effect, except for any such certificates, permits, licenses, franchises,
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations and clearances which the failure to
have or to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Laser Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the Filed Laser SEC Reports, Laser and its subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with their respective obligations under the
Laser Licenses, with only such exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Laser Material Adverse Effect. Except
as disclosed in the Filed Laser SEC Reports, Laser and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with all judgments, orders, decrees, statutes, Laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity applicable to them, except for
such noncompliance which individually or in the aggregate would not have a Laser
Material Adverse Effect.

         its or their officers or directors in the ordinary course of business
         consistent with past practice); and

                           (xiv) The Company and its subsidiaries shall not
         authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions.

hereof to the Holdings Effective Time, the Company and Laser shall not, and
shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any action that
would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of such party set forth in this Agreement that
are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such
representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material respect or (iii) any of the conditions to the Company Merger set forth

                  Section 6.3 ADVICE OF CHANGES. Upon obtaining knowledge of
any such occurrence, the Company and Laser shall promptly advise the other party
orally and in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained
in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so
qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement or (iii) any change or event (x) having, or which, insofar as can
reasonably be foreseen, would have, in the case of Laser, a Laser Material
Adverse Effect and, in the case of the Company, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (y) having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would have,
the effect set forth in clause (i) above or (z) which has resulted, or which,
insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would result, in any of the conditions
set forth in Article VIII hereof not being satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of Laser Common Stock in connection with the Company Merger
and the Holdings Merger. The Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company, its subsidiaries and the holders of the Company Common Stock and
Laser shall furnish all information concerning Laser and its subsidiaries, in
each case, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

                  Section 7.2 ACCESS AND INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. The
Company and Laser shall each afford to the other and to the other's financial
advisors, legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other representatives full
access at all reasonable times throughout the period prior to the Company
Effective Time to all of its books, records, properties, plants and personnel
(provided that all such access shall be on reasonable advance notice and shall

furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws, and (b) all other information as such other party may
reasonably request, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.2

<PAGE>

Laser and the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Laser
and as is reasonably customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with transactions such as those
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b) Laser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to

independent public accountants, dated the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective and as of the date on which the Information

                  Section 7.4 LISTING APPLICATION. Laser shall prepare and
submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the Laser Shares to be issued

to obtain, prior to the Company Effective Time, approval for the listing of such
Laser Shares, subject to official notice of issuance.

                  Section 7.5 AFFILIATES. Prior to the Company Effective Time,
the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Laser a list (reasonably
satisfactory to counsel for Laser) identifying each person who, at the time the
Information Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders, may be deemed to
be an "affiliate" of the Company, as such term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "COMPANY RULE 145 AFFILIATES"). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such person who is
identified as a Company Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Laser on
or prior to the Company Effective Time a written agreement, in customary form,
that such Company Rule 145 Affiliate will not (i) sell, pledge, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, or in any other way reduce such Company Rule 145
Affiliate's risk relative to, any Laser Shares issued to such Company Rule 145
Affiliate in connection with the Company Merger, except pursuant to an effective
registration statement or in compliance with such Rule 145 or another exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or (ii) sell or in any
other way reduce such Rule 145 Affiliate's risk relative to any Laser Shares
received in the Company Merger (within the meaning of Section 201.01 of the
SEC's Financial Reporting Release No. 1) during the period commencing thirty
(30) days prior to the Company Effective Time and ending at such time as the
financial results (including combined sales and net income) covering at least
thirty (30) days of post-Merger operations have been published, except as
permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 76 issued by the SEC.

                  Section 7.6 HSR ACT; COMPETITION LAWS. As soon as reasonably
practicable, the Company, Laser and Merger Sub shall make or cause to be made
all filings and submissions under the HSR Act (if applicable) and any other

connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject
to Section 7.2 hereof, the Company will furnish to Laser and Laser will furnish
to the Company, such information and assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any such filings or submissions.
Subject to Section 7.2 hereof, the Company will provide Laser, and Laser will
provide the Company, with copies of

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any governmental agency or authority or members of their respective
staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Laser shall consult with one another with
respect to any such correspondence, filings or communications and shall engage
in discussions with any Governmental Entity on a joint basis.

                  Section 7.7 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a) From and after the Holdings Effective Time, Laser shall
honor, and shall cause the Company to honor, all employment, severance,
termination, consulting and retirement agreements to which the Company is a
party as of the Holdings Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) neither
Laser nor the Company shall have any responsibility for the Company's
obligations under that certain employment agreement entered into as of October
1, 1997, between the Company and Jerry W. Levin (except for the incentive
payment provided for in section 3.2(b) thereof (relating to the divestiture of
Coleman Safety & Security Products, Inc.), which shall be the responsibility of
the Company and paid in accordance with the terms of section 3.2(b) thereof),
and (ii) neither Laser nor the Company shall have any responsibility for the
Company's obligations under that certain employment agreement entered into as of
July 1, 1997, between the Company and Paul E. Shapiro. Except as provided in the
first sentence of Section 7.7(b) or the proviso to this sentence, from and after
the Holdings Effective Time, Laser will cause the Company to allow Company
employees to participate in Laser employee benefit plans on substantially the
same basis as similarly situated Laser employees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Laser
will cause the Company to continue the Company Plans for at least six (6) months
following the Holdings Effective Time. Laser will or will cause the Company to
give Company employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting of
benefits and benefit accrual for service with the Company and its affiliates
prior to the Holdings Effective Time under each Laser employee benefit plan;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such crediting of service results in duplication of
benefits. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained for the benefit
of Company employees from and after the Holdings Effective Time, Laser shall (i)
cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations and (ii) give
effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to
claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such employees
with respect to similar plans maintained by the Company for such employee's
benefit immediately prior to the Holdings Effective Time. Laser acknowledges
that, for the purposes of certain of such Company Plans and certain of such
other employment, severance, termination, consulting and retirement agreements
to which the Company is currently a party, the consummation of the Holdings
Merger will constitute a "change in control" of the Company (as such term is
defined in such plans and agreements). Laser agrees to cause the Company, after
the Holdings Effective Time, to pay all amounts provided under such Company
Plans and agreements as a result of a change in control of the Company in
accordance with their respective terms and to honor, and to cause the Company to
honor, all rights, privileges and modifications to or with respect to any such
Company Plans or agreements which become effective as a result of such change in
control.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Laser shall cause the Company to continue the Company's
Executive Annual Incentive Policy for the remainder of 1998, and participants
therein shall not be eligible for participation in an analogous Laser incentive
plan in respect of 1998. Laser shall honor, and shall cause the Company to
honor, the Company's Executive Severance Policy without any amendment adverse to
participants. Laser shall provide severance benefits for employees of the
Company, who are not participants in Company's Executive Severance Policy and
who do not have employment agreements with the Company, under the Laser
severance policy on the same basis as similarly situated Laser employees
provided that severance benefits shall be no less than those set forth on
Schedule 7.7(b).

                  (c) Effective as of the ninety-first (91st) day following the
Holdings Effective Time, the participants in the Executive Severance Policy set
forth on Schedule 7.7(c) may voluntarily terminate their employment, which
termination will be deemed to be for "Good Reason" under the Executive Severance
Policy as a result of the consummation of the Holdings Merger.

                  (d) Laser and the Company agree to take all necessary action
to provide that, effective as of the Holdings Effective Time, all outstanding
Employee Stock Options shall be vested and exercisable as of the Holdings
Effective Time, and between the Holdings Effective Time and the Company
Effective Time, Laser shall cause the Company to maintain a broker-dealer
cashless exercise procedure for the exercise of Employee Stock Options. Laser
and the Company agree to take all other actions necessary to provide for the
cancellation, effective at the Company Effective Time, of each outstanding
Employee Stock Option and, in settlement therefor, a payment to the holder of
the Employee Stock Option in cash by Laser or the Company at the Company
Effective Time equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Employee Stock Option, and (ii) the excess of
$27.50 over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Employee Stock Option, less any applicable withholding taxes.

                  (e) Laser agrees that, at or prior to the Holdings Effective
Time, Holdings may cause the Company to (i) assume sponsorship of the pension,
retirement, savings, retiree health care and life insurance and other plans
maintained by New Coleman Holdings, Inc. that are reflected in footnotes 7 and
12 to the 1996 financial statements included in the Company's 1996 Annual Report
on SEC Form 10-K (as such plans may have been changed in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 1996) (the "PLANS"), and (ii) assume the liabilities
and obligations of New Coleman Holdings, Inc. under the Plans to the extent
reflected in such footnotes (as such liabilities and obligations may have
changed in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 1996). The
documents used to effect such assumption shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent Holdings and Laser.

                  Section 7.8 CONTINUANCE OF EXISTING INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS.

                  (a) For six (6) years after the Company Effective Time (and
during the period following the Holdings Effective Time but prior to the Company
Effective Time), Laser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who is

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Company Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company (an
"INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each, a "CLAIM") to the extent
that any such Claim is based on, or arises out of: (i) the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise;
or (ii) this Agreement or the Holdings Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in each case to the extent that any
such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior
to or at the Company Effective Time, regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Effective Time, to the
full extent permitted under the DGCL, the Company's certificate of incorporation
or by-laws or any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof,
including provisions relating to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense
of any such Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Laser nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Person in connection
with any proceeding (or portion thereof) involving any Claim initiated by such
Indemnified Person against the Company unless the initiation of such proceeding
(or portion thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company or
unless such proceeding is brought by an Indemnified Person to enforce rights
under this Section 7.8; and PROVIDED FURTHER that in the event any Claim is
asserted or made within such period, all such rights, liabilities and
limitations in respect of any such Claim shall continue until disposition
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event
any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any Claim after the Company Effective
Time, Laser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, periodically
advance to such Indemnified Person its legal and other expenses (including the
cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith),
subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to
reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled thereto.

                  (b) Laser and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification, and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of
any Indemnified Person, as provided in the Company's certificate of
incorporation or by-laws and any indemnification agreement in effect at the date
hereof, shall survive the Holdings Merger and the Company Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period
of six (6) years from the Company Effective Time (and during the period
following the Holdings Effective Time but prior to the Company Effective Time)
to the extent such rights and limitations are consistent with the DGCL;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event any Claim is asserted or made within such
period, all such rights, liabilities and limitations in respect of any such
Claim shall continue until disposition thereof; PROVIDED FURTHER that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Person's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the
Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any such agreement, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Indemnified Person and reasonably 

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

acceptable to Laser; and PROVIDED FURTHER that nothing in this Section 7.8 shall
impair any rights or obligations of any current or former director or officer of
the Company.

                  (c) Laser or the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain a liability insurance policy ("D&O INSURANCE") for the
benefit of the Company's existing and former directors and officers commencing
at the Holdings Effective Time and for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Company Effective Time providing substantially similar coverage in
amounts and on terms no less advantageous than that currently provided to such
existing and former directors and officers; PROVIDED FURTHER that neither Laser
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an annual premium for D&O
Insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such
amount.

                  (d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives.

                  Section 7.9 EXPENSES. Whether or not the Company Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such expenses.

                  Section 7.10 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Laser and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing their respective initial press
releases to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Holdings Merger.

                  Section 7.11 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings with, and the taking of
all other reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including
those in connection with the HSR Act, if applicable); (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from persons other than Governmental
Entities; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to require any party hereto to enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity or to consent to any order, decree or judgment requiring
such party to hold, separate or divest, or to restrict the dominion or control
of such 

                                      -34-

party or any of its Affiliates over, any of the assets, properties or businesses
of such party or its Affiliates in existence on the date hereof.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is entered into as of this 28th day
of February, 1998 by and between Sunbeam Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer"), Java Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer or other wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer as contemplated
hereby ("MergerCo"), and Signature Brands USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, the Buyer
and MergerCo have determined that the merger of MergerCo with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, would be advisable and in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders, and such Boards of Directors have
approved such Merger, pursuant to which each share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined in Section
1.3) will be converted into the right to receive cash, other than (a) shares of
Company Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any
subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.4) of the Company, the Buyer or MergerCo
and (b) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3. l(d));

         WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
furtherance of the Merger, the Buyer will make, or will cause MergerCo to make,
a tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire any and all shares of Company Common
Stock;

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with Buyer pursuant to
which, subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, Buyer is willing
to purchase and such stockholders are willing to sell certain Shares owned by
such stockholders;

         WHEREAS, approval of this Agreement requires the vote of a majority in
number of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the
approval thereof (the "Company Stockholder Approval"); and

         WHEREAS, Buyer, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various terms of and conditions to
the Offer and the Merger;

                                        1


<PAGE>

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                    THE OFFER

         1.1      THE OFFER.

                  1.1.1 GENERAL. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article IX, the Buyer shall commence, or
shall cause MergerCo to commence, the Offer to acquire any and all shares of
Company Common Stock for a cash price per share equal to the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 3.1(c), (the "Offer Price")), as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than five
(5) business days after the initial public announcement of Offeror's intention
to commence the Offer. For purposes of this Article I, the party which makes the
Offer, whether the Buyer or MergerCo, shall be referred to as the "Offeror."
Offeror may not accept any shares of Company Common Stock tendered for purchase
in response to the Offer unless it accepts all such shares that are properly
tendered in accordance with the terms thereof. Acceptance by Offeror of shares
of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer shall be irrevocable.
The Offer shall be subject: (i) to the condition that there shall be validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the expiration date
of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares of Company Common Stock which,
together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by the Buyer and
MergerCo, represents at least 51% of the total number of outstanding shares of
the Company Common Stock, assuming the exercise of all outstanding options,
rights and convertible securities (if any) and the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock that the Company is then obligated to issue (such total
number of outstanding or issuable shares of Company Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the "Fully Diluted Shares") (the "Minimum Condition")
and (ii) to the other conditions set forth in Annex I attached hereto
(collectively, the "Offer Conditions"). The Buyer and MergerCo expressly reserve
the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer, including but not limited
to, the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition. The initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be twenty (20) business days after commencement. Buyer and
MergerCo agree that if all of the Offer Conditions are not satisfied on such
initial expiration date of the Offer then, provided that the Offeror determines,
in its reasonable discretion that all such Conditions are reasonably capable of
being satisfied and subject to SEC rules with respect to extension of time
periods, Offeror shall extend the Offer, without consent of the Company, from
time to time until such Conditions are satisfied or waived; provided, that
Offeror shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond April 30, 1998, unless
any necessary approvals under the HSR Act (as defined herein) shall not have
been received by such date, in which case Offeror shall not be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earlier of (i) ten (10) days following receipt of
such approvals and (ii) June 30, 1998. Buyer and MergerCo 

                                        2


<PAGE>

agree that upon the expiration date of the Offer, as the same may be extended in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, if the Offer Conditions have
been satisfied, Offeror shall accept the shares of Company Common Stock properly
tendered for purchase. Without the prior written consent of the Company, no
change may be made by Offeror which reduces the maximum number of shares of
Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer or which reduces the Offer
Price or changes the form of consideration or changes the Offer Conditions. The
Offer Price shall, subject to reduction for applicable withholding of taxes, be
net to the seller in cash, payable upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, Offeror shall
pay, as promptly as practicable after expiration of the Offer, for all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn. At or prior to the
expiration of the Offer, Offeror will take all steps necessary to provide its
paying agent any funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by the Offer.
Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration shall be the
amount set forth in Section 3.1(c) payable without interest thereon, and such
initial Merger Consideration shall be adjusted only in accordance with the
following provisions. The Merger Consideration payable in connection with the
Offer shall automatically be adjusted appropriately for any stock dividend,
split or any conversion or reclassification in respect of the Company Common
Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the date of consummation of
the Offer, which shall occur only in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Buyer and MergerCo shall have the right to increase the Merger
Consideration in effect hereunder at any time, in which case the consideration
payable with respect to the Offer shall also be so increased.

                  1.1.2 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. On the date of commencement
of the Offer, Offeror shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule 14D-1 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-1") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule 14D-1 shall contain or
shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase")
and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related summary
advertisement (the Schedule 14D-1, the Offer to Purchase and such other
documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred
to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). Offeror and the Company agree
to promptly correct any information provided by either of them for use in the
Offer Documents which shall have become false or misleading, and Offeror further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-1 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be
disseminated to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Offeror agrees
to provide the Company with a written copy of any comments it or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-1 promptly after receipt of such comments.

prior written consent of the Company, (i) terminate the Offer, except in
accordance with the terms of Annex I attached hereto, or (ii) extend the
Expiration Date, except as specifically provided herein, and in

under the HSR Act shall not have been received by such date, in no event to a
date later than the earlier of (i) ten (10) days following receipt of such
approvals and (ii) June 30, 1998.

         1.2      ACTION BY THE COMPANY.

                  1.2.1 APPROVAL AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD. The Company
hereby approves of and consents to the making of the Offer and represents that
(a) the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held on
February 28, 1998 has (i) determined that the Merger and the Offer, taken
together, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the holders
of the Company Common Stock, (ii) advised, authorized and approved this
Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including but not limited to the Offer), (iii) recommended that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and authorize and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) agreed to recommend
that holders of Company Common Stock tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, and (b) Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corporation has delivered to the Board an oral opinion on February 28, 1998
which will be confirmed promptly in writing, to the effect that, as of such
date, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company

the holders of shares of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view.
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6 hereof and the other provisions of this
Agreement, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
prepared in connection with the Offer of the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company described in the immediately preceding sentence.

                  1.2.2 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. On the date of commencement

Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing, subject to the provisions of Section
6.6 hereof and the other provisions of this Agreement, the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company described in Section 1.2.1 and shall mail the
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company. The Schedule 14D-9 will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company and Offeror agree to correct promptly any information
provided by any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall have become
false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Buyer and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing
with the SEC or dissemination to stockholders of the 


                                       4
<PAGE>

Company. The Company agrees to provide Offeror with a written copy of any
comments it or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, promptly after receipt of such
comments.

                  1.2.3 STOCKHOLDER LISTS. In connection with the Offer and the
Merger, the Company shall furnish Offeror with mailing labels containing the
names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
with security position listings of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, each as of a recent date, and of those persons becoming record
holders subsequent to such date. The Company shall furnish Offeror with all such
additional information (including, but not limited to, updated lists of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock and their addresses, mailing labels and lists
of security positions) and such other assistance as Offeror or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
owners of shares of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the
Merger, Offeror shall hold in confidence the information contained in such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in
accordance with Section 9.1, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such
information then in its or any of its affiliate's possession.

                  1.2.4    DIRECTORS.

                  (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Offeror of
shares pursuant to the Offer such that Buyer or MergerCo shall own at least a
majority of the Fully Diluted Shares, the Offeror shall be entitled to designate
the number of Directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company's
Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors
on the Company's Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Offeror (including shares of
Company Common Stock accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Offeror's designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company's Board of Directors, including, without limitation, increasing the
number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors. At such times, the Company will use its best efforts to cause
individuals designated by Offeror to constitute the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Company's Board of Directors of (x) each committee
of the Board (other than any committee of the Board established to take action
under this Agreement), (y) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company and (z) each committee of each such board. provided; however, that in
the event that Offeror's designees are elected to the Board of Directors of the
Company, until the Effective Time, such Board of Directors shall have at least
two directors who are directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and
who are not officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries 


                                       5
<PAGE>

(the "Independent Directors") and; provided further that, in such event, if the
number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director shall designate a person to fill
such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors
of the Company on the date hereof shall designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who shall not be officers or affiliates of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or officers or affiliates of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
affirmative vote of the majority of the Independent Directors shall be required
to (i) amend or otherwise modify the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, (ii) approve any amendment, modification or waiver by the Company of
any provisions of this Agreement or (iii) approve any other action by the
Company that materially adversely affects the interests of the stockholders of
the Company (other than Buyer or MergerCo) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, any actions which would
constitute a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein. The provisions of this Section 1.2.4(a) are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights which the Buyer, MergerCo or any of
their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares as a matter
of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

                  (b) The Company's obligations to appoint designees to the
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall
promptly take all action requested by Offeror necessary to effect any such
election, including mailing to its stockholders the information statement
containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing
with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Offeror shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be
included in the Information Statement with respect to Offeror's designees). In
connection with the foregoing, the Company will promptly, at the option of
Offeror, either increase the size of the Company's Board of Directors and/or
obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary
to enable Offeror's designees to be elected or appointed to, and to constitute a
majority of the Company's Board of Directors as provided above. Offeror will
supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information
with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

Effective Time of the Merger (as hereafter defined). Upon the Effective Time of
the Merger, the separate existence of MergerCo or such wholly owned subsidiary

transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section
9.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in

Corporation shall file a certificate of merger or, if applicable, MergerCo shall
file a certificate of ownership and merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
executed in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") with
the Delaware Secretary of State and the Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such other time as is specified in the Certificate
of Merger as MergerCo and the Company shall agree should be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time of the Merger").

         2.4. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the DGCL

         2.5. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BY-LAWS. (a) The Certificate of
Incorporation of MergerCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation except that it shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving
Corporation to Signature Brands USA, Inc. and, as so amended, until thereafter
further amended as provided therein and under the DGCL, it shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger.

         (b) The By-laws of MergerCo as in effect at the Effective Time of the

<PAGE>

         2.6. DIRECTORS. The directors of MergerCo at the Effective Time of the
Merger shall be the directors of the Company following the Merger, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

         2.7. OFFICERS. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time of the

                                   ARTICLE III

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
                            CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

         3.1. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time of the Merger,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of MergerCo:

         (a) COMMON STOCK OF MERGERCO. Each share of common stock of MergerCo
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
shall be converted into one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Company.

         (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by the Company or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

         (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Except as otherwise provided
herein and subject to Section 3.3, each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock, other than shares owned by Buyer, MergerCo or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Buyer, the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (collectively, the "Excluded Shares"), and other than Dissenting Shares
and treasury stock, shall be converted into the right to receive in cash from
the Company following the Merger an amount equal to $8.25 (the "Merger
Consideration"), without interest, upon surrender of the certificates formerly
representing such shares pursuant to Section 3.3. The term "Merger
Consideration" shall mean the per share amount in reference to the consideration
designated on a per share basis, and otherwise shall refer to the aggregate
consideration represented by the per share amount multiplied by the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding.

         (d) DISSENTING SHARES. Shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger held by a
holder who has the right to demand payment for and an appraisal of such shares
in accordance with the DGCL (or any 


                                       8
<PAGE>

successor provision) ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
withdraws, forfeits or loses such holder's right to such payment or appraisal,
if any. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, such holder fails to perfect
or withdraws, forfeits or loses any such right to appraisal, each share of such
holder shall be treated as a share that had been converted as of the Effective
Time of the Merger into the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 3.1. The Company shall give prompt notice to MergerCo of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock,
and MergerCo shall have the right to participate in and, at MergerCo's
reasonable discretion, to direct all communications, negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of MergerCo, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands.

         (e) CANCELLATION AND RETIREMENT OF EXCLUDED SHARES. Each Excluded Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

         (f) CANCELLATION AND RETIREMENT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. As of the
Effective Time of the Merger, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall, to
the extent such certificate represents such shares, cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
applicable thereto, without interest, upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 3.3 or the right, if any, to receive payment from the
Surviving Corporation for the "fair value" of such shares as determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

         3.2.     STOCK PLANS AND WARRANTS.

         (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Stock Plans (as defined below)) shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

         (i) cause written notification of the Merger to be given to each holder
of a Company Stock Option (as defined below) by the Board of Directors as
provided in the Stock Plans to the effect that each such holder of a Company
Stock Option may exercise such Company Stock Option (whether or not such Company
Stock Option was 



                                       9
<PAGE>

exercisable immediately before such notification was given) no later than thirty
days from the date of such notification (the "Exercise Period"); and

         (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding employee stock options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under
the Company's Chief Executive Officer Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option and
Incentive Plans, 1995 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Second Amended and
Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Option Plans") to provide that, at
the Effective Time of the Merger each Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall vest as a
consequence of the Merger and shall be canceled in exchange for a payment from
the Company after the Merger (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal
to the product of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option and (2) the excess of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option and applicable withholding taxes, payable in cash immediately
following the Effective Time of the Merger, except as otherwise set forth on
Exhibit 3.2(b)(ii); and

         (iii) except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the
parties, the Stock Option Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary shall terminate as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, and the Company shall ensure that, following the
Effective Time of the Merger, no holder of a Company Stock Option nor any
participant in any Stock Option Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire
equity securities of the Company following the Merger.

         (b) Each outstanding Warrant (each a "Warrant") governed by that
certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of August 17, 1994, by and between the
Company and American Bank National Association, as Warrant Agent (the "Warrant
Agreement"), shall at the Effective Time automatically without any further
action of the Company or the holders thereof be converted into the right to
receive an amount equal to the difference between the Merger Consideration and
the Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) in accordance with the
terms of the Warrant Agreement.

         (c) The Company hereby represents and warrants that upon taking of the
actions specified above, immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger,
and after giving effect to the payments described in this Section 3.2, no holder
of a Company Stock Option nor any participant in any Stock Option Plan nor the
holder of any warrant to purchase Company Common Stock shall have the right
thereunder to acquire equity securities of the Company, or any other benefit,
after the Merger.

                                       10
<PAGE>

         3.3. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Buyer
shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") (who
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to receive the funds to which
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock are entitled to pursuant to this
Article III. Buyer shall, from time to time, make available to the Exchange
Agent funds in amounts and at times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"), a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor (or such other documents as may reasonably be
required in connection with such surrender) in customary form to be agreed by
MergerCo and the Company prior thereto.

         (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. (i) After the Effective Time of the Merger,
each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates and acceptance thereof
by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive the amount of cash into which such
Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement.

          (i) After the Effective Time of the Merger, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates,
and if Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be
canceled against delivery of cash. If Merger Consideration is to be remitted to
a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Company or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required or
establish to the satisfaction of the Company or its transfer agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.3(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time of the Merger to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration applicable thereto as contemplated by Section 3.1. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership
of the shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable law. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable as Merger Consideration or in lieu of any fractional shares of Company
Common Stock. The right of any stockholder to 


                                       11
<PAGE>

receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to reduction to reflect any
applicable withholding obligation for Taxes.

          (ii) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
or the provision of other reasonable assurances requested by Buyer, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

         (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK EXCHANGED FOR
CASH. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to
have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares.

         (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.3
(the "Exchange Fund") which remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for six months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be
delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Company and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, if any, to which such
holders may be entitled.

         (e) NO LIABILITY. None of Buyer, MergerCo, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         (f) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Buyer, on a daily basis.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Buyer.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and MergerCo as
follows:

         4.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER. Each of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4.2) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would not have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 10.4) with respect to the Company. Attached as
Section 4.1 of the schedule (the "Disclosure Schedule") delivered to MergerCo by
the Company at the time of execution of this Agreement are complete and correct
copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and
bylaws, as amended, of the Company. The Company has delivered to MergerCo

Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which, individually or
in the aggregate is material). Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5 of the
Disclosure Schedule and except as set forth in the SEC Documents filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, and except for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent 


                                       16

subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by generally accepted accounting
principles to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes thereto.

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except to
the extent information contained therein is based upon information supplied
solely by the Buyer or MergerCo). The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

<PAGE>

Section 4975 of the Code, excluding any transactions which are exempt

taken any action or made any statement, promise or representation to, or
agreement with, any of its employees, officers or directors that after the
Closing, Buyer will continue or establish any Benefit Plan or other plan or
arrangement or provide any particular benefits or compensation to employees. To
the knowledge of the Company, the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to

Except as required by law, each of the Company and MergerCo will hold, and will
cause its respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives and affiliates to hold, any
nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance
with that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 17, 1998 by or on
behalf of the Company and Buyer, the other terms of which Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby terminated.

         7.3. ADDITIONAL UNDERTAKINGS.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer, MergerCo and the Company will use
their reasonable best efforts and cooperate with one another (i) in promptly
determining whether any filings are required to be made or consents, approvals,
waivers, licenses, Permits or authorizations are required to be obtained (or,
which if not obtained, would result in a breach or violation, or an event of
default, termination or acceleration of any agreement or any put right under any
agreement) under any applicable law or regulation or from any governmental
authorities or third parties, including parties to loan agreements or other debt
instruments, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer, the Merger and (ii) in promptly making any such filings, in
furnishing information required in connection therewith and in timely seeking to
obtain any such consents, approvals, permits or authorizations. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, or any other covenant herein contained, in connection with the
receipt of any necessary approvals under the HSR Act, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to divest or hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any material portions thereof or any of the businesses, product
lines, properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without
Buyer's prior written consent.

         (b) The Company and Buyer shall make, subject to the condition that the
transactions contemplated herein actually occur, any undertakings (including
undertakings to make divestitures, provided, in any case, that such divestitures
need not themselves be effective or made until after the transactions
contemplated hereby actually occur) required in order to comply with the
antitrust requirements or laws of any 


                                       35
<PAGE>

governmental entity, including the HSR Act, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         7.4 INDEMNIFICATION. For six years after the Effective Time of the
Merger, the Company and the Buyer shall indemnify all present and former
directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time of the Merger, to the fullest extent as would have been
permitted in their respective articles of organization or by-laws consistent
with applicable law, to the extent such Costs have not been paid for by
insurance and shall, in connection with defending against any action for which
indemnification is available hereunder, reimburse such Indemnified Parties from
time to time upon receipt of sufficient supporting documentation, for any
reasonable costs and expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Parties;
provided that such reimbursement shall be conditioned upon such Indemnified
Parties' agreement promptly to return such amounts to the Company if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine that indemnification of such
Indemnified Parties is prohibited by applicable law. The Company will maintain
for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time of the Merger,
the Company's current directors' and officers, insurance and indemnification
policy (or a policy providing substantially similar coverage) to the extent that
it provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger (the "D&O Insurance") for all persons who are directors and officers of
the Company on the date of this Agreement; provided that the Company shall not
be required to spend as an annual premium for such D&O Insurance an amount in
excess of 200% of the annual premium paid for directors' and officers' insurance
in effect prior to the date of this Agreement; and provided further that the
Company shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such amount. The provisions of this Section are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

         7.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Neither MergerCo or the Buyer, on the one
hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will issue any press release or public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, without the other party's prior consent,
except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with NASDAQ, and in any event MergerCo and the
Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any such press release or other public
statements with respect to such transactions. The parties agree that 


                                       36
<PAGE>

the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior
to the issuance thereof.

         7.6 NO SOLICITATION.

         (a) From and after the date hereof until the termination of this
Agreement, neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or affiliates
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will directly or indirectly
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
non-public information or assistance), or take any other action to facilitate
knowingly, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to any Transaction Proposal (as defined below),
or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person
or entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Transaction Proposal
or agree to or endorse any Transaction Proposal or authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors or employees or any of its Subsidiaries or any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to take any such
action, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company which, for purposes of this
Section 7.6, shall include any Special Committee thereof from, prior to the
acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (i)
furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any
person or entity that makes an unsolicited written, bona fide Transaction
Proposal and in respect of which such person or entity has all of the necessary
funds or commitments therefor if, and only to the extent that: (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company, after consultation with their financial advisors and
after receipt of advice from independent outside legal counsel (who may be the
Company's regularly engaged independent outside legal counsel) determines in
good faith that such action is necessary for the Board of Directors of the
Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
law, (B) prior to taking such action the Company receives from such person or
entity an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms and
provisions substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement described in Section 7.2, (ii) failing to make or withdrawing or
modifying its recommendation referred to in Section 4.15 if there exists a
Transaction Proposal and the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with its financial advisors and after receipt of advice from
independent outside legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly engaged
outside independent counsel), determines in good faith that such action is
necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable law in connection with such Transaction
Proposal or (iii) making to the Company's stockholders any recommendation 


                                       37
<PAGE>

and related filing with the SEC as required by Rule 14e-2 and 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act, with respect to any tender offer, or taking any other legally
required action with respect to such tender offer (including, without
limitation, the making of public disclosures as may be necessary or reasonably
advisable under applicable securities laws) if the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with their financial advisors and receipt of advice
from independent outside legal counsel (who may be the Company's regularly
engaged independent counsel), determines in good faith that such action is
necessary for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable law; and Section 7.6(b) and 7.6(c) are
fully complied with by the Board of Directors of the Company. In the event of an
exercise of the Company's or it's Board of Director's rights under clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) above and subject to compliance with this Section 7.6,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, such
exercise of rights shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "Transaction Proposal" shall mean any
of the following (other than the transactions between the Company and MergerCo
contemplated by the Offer and this Agreement) involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries: (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination, or other similar transaction; (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 20% or
more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
single transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange
offer for, or the acquisition (or right to acquire) of "beneficial ownership" by
any person, "group" or entity (as such terms are defined under Section 13 (d) of
the Exchange Act), of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act
in connection therewith; (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the
foregoing or recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (vi) any other transaction
the consummation of which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, prevent or materially delay the Offer or the Merger or which would
reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to Buyer of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         (b) Prior to the Board of Directors withdrawing or modifying its
approval or recommendation of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger, approving
or recommending a Transaction Proposal, or entering into an agreement with
respect to a Transaction Proposal, the Board of Directors shall provide Buyer
with a written notice (a "Notice of Takeover Proposal") advising Buyer that the
Board of Directors has received a Takeover Proposal, specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Transaction Proposal (unless prohibited from doing
so by the terms thereof) and identifying the person making such transaction
Proposal (unless prohibited from doing so by the terms thereof), and neither the
Company nor any subsidiary shall enter into an agreement with respect to a


                                       38
<PAGE>

Transaction Proposal until midnight three business days after the day on which
the Notice of Takeover Proposal was given to Buyer. In addition, if the Company
proposes to enter into an agreement with respect to any Transaction Proposal, it
shall concurrently with entering into such agreement pay, or cause to be paid,
to Buyer the expenses and fees and the Termination Fee (as provided in and
defined in Section 10.2)

         7.7 RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS. Prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, the Company shall deliver to MergerCo evidence satisfactory to MergerCo
of the resignation of all directors of the Company, effective at the Effective
Time of the Merger.

         7.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Buyer agrees that, for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
employee benefits plans and arrangements (directly or in conjunction with Buyer)
which, in the aggregate, will provide a level of benefits to continuing
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided under the Buyer's benefit plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than discretionary benefits);
provided, however, that Buyer may cause modifications to be made to such benefit
plans and arrangements to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law or
to reflect widespread adjustments in benefits (or costs thereof) provided to
employees under compensation and benefit plans of Buyer and its subsidiaries,
and no specific compensation and benefit plans need be provided. For purposes of
determining eligibility and vesting with respect to all Benefit Plans set forth
on Schedule 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule (except with respect to any defined
benefit plans), Buyer shall use the employee's hire date with the Company or
such other date as has been previously determined by the Company for credit for
prior employment with any ERISA Affiliate of the Company. Benefit plans which
provide medical, dental, or life insurance benefits after the Effective Time to
any individual who is an active or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time or a dependent of such an employee shall,
with respect to such individuals, waive any waiting periods, any pre-existing
conditions, and any actively-at-work exclusions to the extent so waived under
present policy and shall provide that any expenses incurred on or before the
Effective Time by such individuals shall be taken into account under such plans
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance, and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions to the extent taken into account under present policy.
Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall prohibit the Company or the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any employee at any time with or
without cause (subject to, and in accordance with the terms of any existing
employment agreements), or shall be construed or applied to restrict the ability
of the Buyer or Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to establish such
types and levels of compensation and benefits as they determine to be
appropriate. Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation (or the applicable


                                       39
<PAGE>

Subsidiary employer) to honor the existing employment agreements that are set
forth on Schedule 7.8 of the Disclosure Schedule.

         7.9 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer and MergerCo and Buyer and MergerCo shall give prompt notice to
the Company of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which does or would be likely to cause (A) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied; and (ii) any
failure of the Company on the one hand, or Buyer or MergerCo on the other hand,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

         7.10 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. If any "fair price" or "control share
acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement or
this Agreement, including the Offer or the Merger, the Company and Buyer, and
their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts to
grant such approvals and to take such other actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise use their reasonable best
efforts to eliminate the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

<PAGE>

restraint or prohibition shall be in effect preventing or prohibiting the
acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares of Common Stock pursuant to

prohibition vacated.

to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform its
obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger); or

         (c) by the Company, if Offeror shall not have (i) commenced the Offer
within five (5) business days after the initial public announcement of Buyer's

         (e) by Buyer in the event of a material breach or failure to perform in

other agreement contained in this Agreement which cannot be or has not been
cured within 10 days after the giving of written notice to the Company; or

         (f) by the Company, in the event of a material breach or failure to
perform in any material respect by MergerCo or Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which cannot
be or has not been cured within 10 days after the giving of written notice to
MergerCo or Buyer.

         (g) by Buyer, if Offeror terminates the Offer in accordance with the
terms of Annex I.

         9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or MergerCo as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability

of Section 4.13, Section 5.5, the last sentence of Section 7.2, this Section
9.2, Section 10.2 and Section 10.7. Nothing contained in this Section shall

contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 9.3, waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section

the Merger and none of the Company, Buyer and MergerCo, nor any officer,
director or employee or shareholder thereof shall be under any liability
whatsoever with respect to any such representation or warranty after such time.

time prior to 12 months following the termination of this Agreement any such

<PAGE>

                  SELLERS' REPRESENTATIONS. Each of the Sellers severally
represents and warrants to the Purchaser (a) that such Seller has the power and

commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to
which such Seller is a party or by which such Seller is bound and, if the Seller
is a corporation, partnership or other entity, the organizational documents
thereof, (e) that on the date hereof such Seller has, and at any Closing (as
defined below) hereunder such Seller will have (without exception), good and
valid title to such Seller's Shares, free and clear of all claims, liens,
charges, encumbrances and security interests, restricting such Seller's ability
to enter into this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder, (f) that
there are no options or rights to purchase or acquire, or agreements relating to
any such rights with respect to, any of such Seller's Shares except pursuant to
this Agreement, (g) that the transfer of such Seller's Shares to the Purchaser

<PAGE>

which are not material).

                  PURCHASER'S REPRESENTATIONS. The Purchaser represents and
warrants to each of the Sellers that (a) the Purchaser has duly authorized,
executed and delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a valid and binding
agreement, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms and
(b) the Purchaser will acquire the Shares for its own account and not with a
view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and the
Purchaser will not sell or otherwise dispose of the Shares except in compliance
with, or pursuant to an exemption from registration under, the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

                  AGREEMENT TO SELL. At the Closing provided for in Section 4 of
this Agreement and subject to the conditions in Section 5 of this Agreement,
each of the Sellers will sell, transfer and deliver such Seller's Shares to the
Purchaser (duly endorsed for transfer in blank or accompanied by stock transfer
powers duly executed in blank, with all necessary stock transfer tax stamps
affixed and cancelled) and the Purchaser will purchase such Seller's Shares and
deliver to such Seller a certified or official bank check or checks payable to
or upon the order of such Seller in immediately available funds, at a price per
Share equal to $8.25 such higher per Share price as the Purchaser may have paid
pursuant to the Offer. Each Seller will, upon request of the Purchaser, promptly
execute and deliver all additional documents reasonably deemed by the Purchaser
to be necessary, appropriate or desirable to effect, complete and evidence the
sale, assignment and transfer of such Seller's Shares pursuant to this
Agreement.

                  CLOSING. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and


<PAGE>

sale hereunder shall take place at the office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &

day after the purchase of Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or (ii)
if the Offer has otherwise terminated or expired, such date (which shall be at
least one business day following the date of notice) as the Purchaser may
specify in writing to the Sellers. Payment for the Shares shall be in
immediately available funds. Any Seller may tender such Seller's Shares pursuant
to the Offer, provided, however, that until such time as such Shares are
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, such Shares shall continue to be
governed by this Agreement. If a Seller's Shares are tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer, the payment for such Seller's Shares pursuant to
the Offer shall constitute the Closing of the purchase and sale of such Shares
hereunder.

                  CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.  (a) The obligations of the Purchaser
and each of the Sellers under this Agreement shall be subject to the
satisfaction at the Closing of each of the following conditions:

                                    Neither the Purchaser nor such Seller shall
         be subject to any order, decree or injunction of a court of competent
         jurisdiction which prevents or delays the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Closing shall not
         be prohibited by any rule, regulation, ruling or law.

                                    The applicable waiting period with respect
         to such Closing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
         of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), shall have expired or been
         terminated.

                                    The representations and warranties of such
         Seller (in the case of the Purchaser) or the Purchaser (in the


<PAGE>

         case of each Seller) shall be true and correct in all material respects
         and such Seller (in the case of the Purchaser) or the Purchaser (in the
         case of each Seller) shall have complied in all material respects with
         its covenants hereunder.

                  CHANGES IN SHARES. In the event of any change in the number of
Shares outstanding by recapitalization, declaration of a stock split or
combination or payment of a stock dividend or the like, the number of Shares to
be transferred to the Purchaser and the per Share payments to be made to the
Sellers shall be appropriately adjusted. Each Seller's Shares shall include all
Shares acquired after the date hereof by such Seller and all dividends or
distributions in respect of the Seller's Shares.

agrees not to:

                           sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose
of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of
such Seller's Shares;

                           grant any proxies, deposit of such Seller's Shares
into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of such
Shares;

                           solicit, encourage, participate in or initiate
discussions or negotiations with, or provide information to, any person, other
than Parent or any affiliate of Parent, concerning any merger, sale of assets,
sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving the Company or
any subsidiary or division of the Company; provided nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit or restrict in any respect the ability of Directors of the
Company who are Sellers or may be affiliated with Sellers from exercising the
fiduciary duties in accordance


<PAGE>

with Section 7.6 of the Merger Agreement; or

                           take any action which would make any representation
or warranty of such Seller herein untrue or incorrect.

                  SELLER'S ACTIONS. Each Major Seller hereby agrees that at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company however called, it shall (a) vote
such Seller's Shares in favor of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) vote such Seller's Shares against any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of the Company
under the Merger Agreement and (c) vote such Seller's Shares against any action
or agreement that would impede, interfere with or discourage the Offer or the
Merger, including, but not limited to: (i) any extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) a sale or transfer of a material amount
of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any change in the
management or Board of Directors of the Company (other than as contemplated by
the Merger Agreement), (iv) any change in the present capitalization or dividend
policy of the Company or (v) any other material change in the Company's
corporate structure or business. Each Major Seller hereby grants the Purchaser
as irrevocable proxy and irrevocably appoints the Purchaser or its designees,
with full power of substitution, its attorney and proxy to vote all such
Seller's Shares in respect of any of the matters set forth in clauses (a)
through (c) of this Section and in the manner specified in such clauses,
provided, however, that such proxy shall not apply to the matters set forth in
clause (c)(iii) of this Section until any waiting period applicable thereto
under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated. Such Seller
acknowledges and agrees that this proxy is coupled with an interest,
constitutes, among other things, an


<PAGE>

inducement for Parent and the Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement, is
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by operation of law or otherwise upon
the occurrence of any event (other than the termination of this Agreement) and
that no subsequent proxies will be given (and if given will not be effective).
Any such proxy shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

                  LEGEND. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, each Seller shall surrender the certificates representing such
Seller's Shares to the Purchaser so that the following legend may be placed on
such certificates:

         are subject to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 28,
         1998, between [the Purchaser] and [the Seller]."

                  SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT. The parties hereto acknowledge that

the obligations of the parties hereto shall be specifically enforceable, in
addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity.

                  BROKERAGE FEES. Each Seller and the Purchaser, in connection
with the transaction contemplated herein, severally and not jointly agrees to
indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations with respect to any brokerage fees, commissions or
finders' fees asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement

case of the Sellers, an affiliate which is also a Seller).

                  EXPENSES. Each party hereto shall pay its own expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement.

                  SURVIVAL. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14(g)

agreements made by each of the Sellers and by the Purchaser in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing hereunder and any investigation at any time made by or
on behalf of any party hereto.

of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other parties except that the rights and obligations of the Purchaser may be
assigned by the Purchaser to Parent or any of its other wholly owned
subsidiaries but no such transfer shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder if such transferee does not perform such obligations.

                           BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Seller and such Seller's

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 28, 1998,
by and among SUNBEAM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), SENTINEL
ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsid iary of
Parent (the "Purchaser"), and FIRST ALERT, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company have unanimously determined that it is fair to and in
the best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the
Company pursuant to a Merger (as defined below) in which Purchaser (or a
wholly-owned Subsidiary thereof) shall be merged with and into the Company upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agree ment;

                  WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, Parent pro poses that the
Purchaser make an offer to purchase for cash the outstanding Shares (as defined
below) at a price of $5.25 per Share, net to the seller;

                  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Stock Sale
Agreement (the "Stock Sale Agreement") with Parent pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions specified therein, such stockholders are willing to pay
to Purchaser the proceeds upon the sale of certain Shares owned by such
stockholders after the date of this Agreement;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the forego ing and the
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                     ARTICLE I

                              THE OFFER AND MERGER

                  Section 1.1 THE OFFER. Subject to this Agree ment not having
been terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, as
promptly as practi cable (but in no event later than five business days after
the public announcement of the execution hereof), the Purchaser shall commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as


<PAGE>



amended (the "Exchange Act")) a tender offer (the "Of fer") for all of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Shares"), of
the Company at a price of $5.25 per Share, net to the seller in cash (such
price, or such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer, being
referred to herein as the "Offer Price"), subject to the conditions set forth in
Annex A hereto.

                  The obligations of the Purchaser to commence the Offer and to
accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the
expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject only to the
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. The Offer shall be made by means of an
offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") containing the terms set forth in
this Agree ment and the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto.

                  The Purchaser shall not decrease the Offer Price or decrease
the number of Shares sought or amend any other condition of the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of the Shares (other than with respect to
insignificant changes or amendments and subject to the penultimate sentence of
this Section 1.1) or impose additional conditions without the written consent of
the Company, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if on the initial sched uled expiration
date of the Offer, which shall be 20 business days after the date the Offer is
commenced, all conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived,
the Purchaser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, extend the
expiration date PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the expiration date of the Offer may not
be extended beyond June 1, 1998. In addition, the Offer Price may be increased,
and the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in connection with
such increase in each case without the consent of the Company. The Purchaser
shall, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions of the Offer, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered
as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that if, immediately prior to the
initial expiration date of the Offer, the Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer equal less than 90% of the outstanding Shares,
the Purchaser may extend the Offer for a period not to exceed ten business days,
notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of such
expiration date of the Offer. The Purchaser agrees that if all conditions set

                                        2


<PAGE>



forth in Annex A are not satisfied on the initial expira tion date of the Offer,
the Purchaser shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer through April 30, 1998 to
provide time to satisfy such conditions.

or vote all Shares owned by such Person in favor of the Merger.

                      (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company will

applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger,
Purchaser and its affiliates and associates shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the Company all copies of such
information in their posses sion.

                  Section 1.3 SEC DOCUMENTS.

                      (a) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is
commenced, Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Sched ule 14D-1
in accordance with the Exchange Act with re spect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-1" and the Schedule 14D-1 together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, includ ing the Offer to Purchase, being
collectively the "Offer Documents"). Concurrently with the commencement of the
Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicita tion/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 in accor dance with the Exchange Act (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9"), which shall, subject to the fiduciary duty of the Board under
applicable law, contain the recommendation referred to in clause (iv) of Section
1.2(a) hereof.

                      (b) Parent and the Purchaser will take all steps necessary
to ensure that the Offer Documents, and the Company will take all steps
necessary to ensure that the Schedule 14D-9, will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable Federal and state securities Laws
and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company's stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that Parent and
the Purchaser make no representa-

                                        4


<PAGE>



tion with respect to information furnished by the Company for inclusion in the
Offer Documents and the Company makes no representation with respect to
information furnished by Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The information supplied in writing by the Company for inclusion in the
Offer Documents and by Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9 will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of Parent and the Purchaser will take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, and the Company will take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal and state securities Laws. Each of Parent and the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents and the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false and
misleading in any material respect and the Purchaser will take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, and the Company will take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Federal and state securities Laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Schedule 14D-9 and all amendments and supplements thereto prior to their filing
with the SEC or dissemination to stockholders of the Company. The Company agrees
to provide in writing Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide Parent and
its counsel an opportunity to participate, including by way of discussions with
the SEC or its staff, in the response of the Company to such comments.

                  Section 1.4 DIRECTORS.

                      (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any
Shares by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall

<PAGE>

designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the
Board of Directors such that the percentage of its designees on the Board shall
equal the percentage of the outstanding Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
its affiliates. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of the
Purchaser, use its best efforts promptly to cause Parent's designees to be so
elected to the Company's Board, and in furtherance thereof, to the extent
necessary, increase the size of the Board of Directors. At such time, the
Company shall also cause Persons designated by Parent to constitute at least the
same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company's
Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company's Board of Directors,
and (ii) each committee (or similar body) of the Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.4, the parties hereto shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least two of the
members of the Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.6 hereof) be, Continuing Directors (as defined below). For purposes
hereof, the term "Continuing Director" shall mean (i) any member of the Board as
of the date hereof, (ii) any member of the Board who is unaffiliated with, and
not a designee or nominee of Parent or Purchaser, or (iii) any successor of a
Continuing Director who is (A) unaffiliated with, and not a designee or nominee,
of Parent or Purchaser, and (B) recommended to succeed a Continuing Director by
a majority of the Continuing Directors then on the Board, and in each case under
clause (iii), who is not an employee of the Company. The Company shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.4(a), including mailing to stockholders the information required by
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (or, at Parent's request, furnishing such
information to Parent for inclusion in the Offer Documents initially filed with
the SEC and distributed to the stockholders of the Company) as is necessary to
enable Parent's designees to be elected to the Company's Board of Directors.
Parent or the Purchaser will supply the Company any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.4(a) are
in addition to and shall not limit any rights which the Purchaser, Parent or 


                                       6
<PAGE>

any of their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a
matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

                      (b) From and after the time, if any, that Parent's
designees constitute a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, any
amendment or modification of this Agreement, any amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws inconsistent with this Agreement, any termination of
this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for performance of any of
the obligations of Parent or the Purchaser hereunder, any waiver of any
condition to the Company's obligations hereunder or any of the Company's rights
hereunder or other action by the Company hereunder may be effected only by the
action of a majority of the Continuing Directors of the Company, which action
shall be deemed to constitute the action of any committee specifically
designated by the Board of Directors to approve the actions and Transactions
contemplated hereby and the full Board of Directors.

                  Section 1.5 THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.6 hereof), the
Company and the Purchaser shall consummate a merger (the "Merger") pursuant to
which (a) the Purchaser (or a wholly-owned Subsidiary thereof) shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser
(or a wholly-owned Subsidiary thereof) shall thereupon cease and (b) the Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the Laws
of the State of Delaware. In the event a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Purchaser rather than the Purchaser is merged with and into the Company in the
Merger, references herein to the Purchaser with respect to the Merger shall be
deemed to be references to such wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Purchaser.

                  Pursuant to the Merger, (x) the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the Certificate of Incorporation"), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the initial certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (y) the by-laws of the Company

the initial By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, each until


                                       7
<PAGE>

thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "DGCL").

                  The directors and officers of the Purchaser at the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified.

                  Section 1.6 EFFECTIVE TIME. Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company will cause a certificate of merger, or, if applicable, a certificate of
ownership and merger (as applicable, the "Certificate of Merger"), to be
executed and filed on the date of the Closing (as defined in Section 1.7) (or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State
of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective on the date on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State or such time as is agreed upon by the parties
and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time is hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time."

                  Section 1.7 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof and, in the
event that Purchaser determines to extend the Offer for up to ten business days
as provided for in Section 1.1 hereof, no later than the second business day

                  Section 1.8 STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

                      (a) If required by applicable law in order to consummate
the Merger, the Company, acting


                                       8
<PAGE>

through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law:

                          (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
         special meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as promptly
         as practicable following the acceptance for payment and purchase of
         Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer for the purpose of
         considering and taking action upon the approval of the Merger and the
         adoption of this Agreement;

                          (ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy
         or information statement in accordance with the Exchange Act relating
         to the Merger and this Agreement and use its best efforts (x) to obtain
         and furnish the information required to be included by the Exchange Act
         and the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) and, after
         consultation with Parent, to respond promptly to any comments made by
         the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement
         and cause a definitive proxy or information statement, including any
         amendment or supplement thereto (the "Proxy Statement") to be mailed to
         its stockholders, provided that no amendment or supplement to the Proxy
         Statement will be made by the Company without consultation with Parent
         and its counsel and (y) to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger
         and this Agreement by its stockholders; and

                          (iii) include in the Proxy Statement the
         recommendation of the Board that stockholders of the Company vote in
         favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

                      (b) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the
Shares then owned by it, the Purchaser or any of its other Subsidiaries and
affiliates in favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

                  Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of the Purchaser:

                      (a) PURCHASER CAPITAL STOCK. Each issued and outstanding
share of capital stock of the Purchaser shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                      (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PURCHASER-OWNED
STOCK. All Shares that are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
and any Shares owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Parent or the
Purchaser shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                      (c) EXCHANGE OF SHARES. Each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any
Shares which are held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Stockholders")) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.2. All such
Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2,
without interest, or the right, if any, to receive payment from the Surviving
Corporation of the "fair value" of such Shares as determined in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL.

                  Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                      (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of the
Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the funds
to which holders of the Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).
Parent shall, from time to time, make available to the Paying Agent funds in
amounts and at times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided herein. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent.

                      (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), whose Shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not appli-


                                       11
<PAGE>

cable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2.
The right of any stockholder to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding obligation.

                      (c) TRANSFER BOOKS; NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE
SHARES. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

                      (d) TERMINATION OF FUND; NO LIABILITY. At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

                  Section 2.3 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be
paid the "fair value" of such holder's Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL, such Shares shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger 


                                       12
<PAGE>

Consideration except as provided in this Section 2.3 and the Company shall give
the Parent notice thereof and the Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written
consent of the Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent, the Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be
treated as though such Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1.

                  Section 2.4 TRANSFER OF SHARES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME. No
transfer of Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation at or after the Effective Time.

                  Section 2.5 COMPANY STOCK PLANS. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares (in each case,
an Option), whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company
and in consideration of such cancellation and except to the extent that Parent
or the Purchaser and the holder of any such Option otherwise agree, the Company
(or, at Parent's option, the Purchaser) shall pay to such holders of Options an
amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise price of each such Option and (B) the number of
Shares previously subject to the Option immediately prior to its cancellation
(such payment to be net of withholding taxes and without interest). If required,
the Company shall cause the Company's employees and directors to consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5, no later than the Effective Time.

                      (b) All stock option or other equity based plans
maintained with respect to the Shares ("Option Plans") shall terminate as of the
Effective Time and the provisions in any other Benefit Plan providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock
of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company
shall be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall use its best
efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of an 


                                       13
<PAGE>

Option or any participant in any Option Plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Section 3.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The
Company represents and warrants to Parent and the Purchaser as follows:

                      (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER. Each of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized and has the requisite corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
and By-laws of the Company, in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and has delivered the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or
other organizational documents of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to
the date of this Agreement, other than Subsidiaries which are incorporated in a
jurisdiction other than a State of the United States. The respective
certificates of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational documents of
the Subsidiaries of the Company do not contain any provision limiting or
otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to control such Subsidiaries.

                      (b) SUBSIDIARIES. The list of Subsidiaries of the Company
filed by the Company with its
most recent Report on Form 10-K is a true and accurate list of all the
Subsidiaries of the Company which are required to be set forth therein. All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are owned by the Company


                                       14
<PAGE>

or by another wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all
Liens, except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. There are no other companies in which the Company has a direct or
indirect ownership interest.

                      (c) CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 30,000,000 Shares and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $.01 per share (the Preferred Shares"). As of the date hereof, (i)
24,335,112 Shares and no Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding and (ii)
1,929,698 shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding
Options. Except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement: (i) no
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding; (ii) there were no stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock grant or contingent stock grants and there are no other
outstanding contractual rights to which the Company is a party the value of
which is based on the value of Shares; (iii) all outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company are, and all shares which may be issued will be, when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to preemptive rights; and (iv) there are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding securities, options, warrants,
calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There are not any outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

                      (d) AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION; COMPANY ACTION. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares, to consummate the Merger contemplated by
this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to approval of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares. This Agreement

the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally
and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the changes in the composition of the Board of Directors of the
Company) and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result
in the creation of any lien or other encumbrance upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i) the Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or By-laws of the Company or the comparable charter
or organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument,
permit, concession, franchise or license applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets (including all agreements
described pursuant to Section 3.1(t)) or (iii) any judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or


                                       16
<PAGE>

regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) or

individually or in the aggregate would not (x) impair in any material respect
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, (y)
prevent or impede, in any material respect, the consummation of any of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) impair, prevent or impede
materially the conduct of the Company's business substantially as now conducted.
No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Federal, state or local government or any court, administrative
or regulatory agency or commission or other governmental authority or agency,
domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity") or any other party, is required by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of

perform its obligations under this Agreement, (y) prevent or significantly delay
the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z)
impair, prevent or impede materially the conduct of the Company's business
substantially as now conducted.

                      (e) SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has
filed all reports, proxy statements, forms, and other documents required to be

contingent or otherwise) required by generally accepted accounting principles to
be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto.

misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no

Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

                      (g) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as set

                      (h) LITIGATION. Except as set forth in SEC documents or

express or implied contract of employment, any law or regulation governing
employment or the termination thereof or other discriminatory, wrongful or
tortious conduct in connection with the employment relationship that,
individually or in the 


                                       19
<PAGE>

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii)
no judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against the Company that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; and (iv) none of the Intellectual Property is subject to any order,

Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
has not been any adoption or amendment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined in Section 3.1(j) hereof) of any Benefit Plan
(as defined in Section 3.1(j) hereof) since September 28, 1997. Except as
disclosed in Schedule 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any formal plan or commitment to create
any additional Benefit Plan or modify or change any existing Benefit Plan that
would affect any employee or terminated employee of the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company. All employment, consulting, severance, termination, change in
control or indemnification agreements, arrangements or understandings between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which are required to be
disclosed in the SEC Documents have been disclosed therein.

                      (j) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; ERISA. Schedule 3.1(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each material
bonus, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
purchase, stock option, severance or termination pay, health insurance,
supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, and each other employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, other than a non-material fringe benefit
plan, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to
(at any time during the past six years) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA
Affiliate"), that is a member of a "controlled group" within the meaning of


                                       20
<PAGE>

section 4001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA") of which the
Company or a Subsidiary is a member or which is under "common control" within
the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA, with the Company or a Subsidiary, for the
benefit of any employee or terminated employee of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate, whether formal or informal (the "Benefit Plans").

                      (ii) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has
delivered a true and complete copy thereof (including all amendments thereto),
as well as true and complete copies of the two most recent annual reports, if
required under ERISA, with respect thereto; the two most recent actuarial
reports, if required under ERISA, with respect thereto; the two most recent
reports prepared with respect thereto in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87, Employer's Accounting for Pensions; the most recent
Summary Plan Description, together with each Summary of Material Modifications,
if required under ERISA with respect thereto; if the Benefit Plan is funded
through a trust or any third party funding vehicle, the trust or other funding
agreement (including all amendments thereto) and the latest financial statements
thereof; and the most recent determination letter received from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as from time
to time amended (the "Code").

                      (iii) No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate since the effective date of ERISA that
has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material
risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a
liability under such Title, other than liability for premiums due the PBGC
(which premiums have been paid when due). Each Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

                                       21
<PAGE>

                      (iv) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
any Benefit Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted.

                      (v) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to
Section 302 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued
benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary
with respect to such plan did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the
then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued
benefits.

                      (vi) Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary of the
Company, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator
thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, any such trust, or any trustee or administrator
thereof, or any party dealing with any Benefit Plan or any such trust could be
subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i) of
ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

                      (vii) No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan,"
as such term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA.

                      (viii) Each Benefit Plan which is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under section 501(a)
of the Code and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred to cause
the loss of such qualified or exempt status.

                      (ix) No Benefit Plan provides health, death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of
service (other than (a) coverage mandated by applicable law or (b) benefits the
full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his
beneficiary).

                                       22
<PAGE>

                      (x) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, alone, will not (a) entitle any current or former employee or officer
of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment, (b) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer, (c) result in any
prohibited transaction described in section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the
Code for which an exemption is not available, or (d) require the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to fund or make any payments to any trust or other funding
vehicle in respect of any Benefit Plan.

                      (xi) There are no pending, threatened or, to the knowledge
of the Company, anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Benefit Plan, by any
employee or beneficiary covered under any such Benefit Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

                      (xii) No Benefit Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or other arrangement authorizes grants of either stock appreciation rights or
restricted stock of the Company and there are no outstanding stock appreciation
rights or restricted stock of the Company.

                      (xiii) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no material Benefit Plan is not subject to ERISA
pursuant to Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA.

                      (k) TAXES. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely filed (or has had timely filed on its behalf) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete
and correct in all material respects. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has paid (or has had paid on its behalf) all Taxes (whether or not
shown as due on such Tax Returns), or the most recent financial statements
contained in the SEC Documents reflect adequate reserves in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for all Taxes not yet paid.

                      (ii) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(k) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (A) no defi-


                                       23
<PAGE>

ciencies for any Taxes have been threatened, proposed, asserted or assessed
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) no governmental authority is
conducting an audit with respect to Taxes or any Tax Return of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (C) no extension or waiver of the statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or any Tax Return has been granted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which remains in effect, (D) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any arrangement to allocate,
share or indemnify another party for Taxes, and (E) there are no liens for
material Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
for liens for Taxes not yet due.

                      (iii) As used in this Agreement, "Taxes" shall include (A)
any Federal, state, local or foreign net income, gross income, receipts,
windfall profit, severance, property, production, sales, use, license, excise,
franchise, employment, payroll, withholding, alternative or add-on minimum, ad
valorem, transfer, stamp or environmental tax, or any other tax, custom, duty,
governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever,
together with any interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount
imposed by any governmental authority, and (B) any liability for the payment of
amounts with respect to payments of a type described in clause (A) as a result
of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, or
as a result of any obligation under a Tax sharing arrangement or a Tax indemnity
arrangement. As used in this Agreement, "Tax Returns" shall mean all returns,
reports, or statements required to be filed with respect to any Tax (including
any attachments thereto), including, without limitation, any information return,
claim for refund, amended return or declaration of estimated Tax.

                      (l) NO EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no amounts payable as a
result of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Benefit
Plans or any other plans or arrangements will constitute a "parachute payment"
to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in section 280G of the
Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable 


                                       24
<PAGE>

compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

Company, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied and are
presently complying in all material respects with all applicable laws (whether

decrees of all governmental authorities (Federal, state, local or otherwise)

Safety and Health Act, the Federal Consumer Product Safety Act, the rules and
regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and all Laws relating to the
safe conduct of business and environmental protection and conservation, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 11246 concerning equal employment
opportunity obligations of Federal contractors and any applicable health,
sanitation, fire, safety, labor, zoning and building Laws and ordinances, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notification of any
asserted present or past failure to so comply, except such non-compliance that
has not and will not prevent the Company from carrying on its business
substantially as now conducted or might reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                      (ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in
effect all material Federal, state, local and foreign governmental approvals,
authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits
and rights, including all authorizations under Environmental Laws ("Permits"),
necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business substantially as now conducted, there are no appeals nor any
other actions pending to revoke any such Permits, and there has occurred no
material default or violation under any such Permits.

                      (iii) To the knowledge of the Company, each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is, and has been, and each of the Company's former

                                       25
<PAGE>

not prevent the Company from carrying on its business substantially as now
conducted or might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no circumstances or conditions that would be reasonably likely to prevent or
interfere with compliance by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the future with
Environmental Laws (or Permits issued thereunder) in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, except such circumstances or conditions that have not and will
not prevent the Company from carrying on its business substantially as now
conducted or might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                      (iv) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(m)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the

matters which are no longer threatened or pending and for which the Company or
its Subsidiaries are not subject to further requirements pursuant to an
administrative or court order, judgment, or a settlement agreement.

                      (v) To the knowledge of the Company, during the period of

respective current or previously owned or leased properties, there have been no
Releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under or affecting such properties and
none of the Company or its Subsidiaries have disposed of any Hazardous Material
or any other substance in a manner that has led, or could reasonably be
anticipated to lead to a Release except in each case for those which
individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Prior to the period of ownership or operation by the Company and
its Subsidiaries of any of their respective current or previously owned or
leased properties, to the knowledge of the Company, no Hazardous Material was
generated, treated, stored, disposed of, used, handled or manufactured at, or
transported shipped or disposed of from, such current or previously owned or
leased properties, and there were no Releases of Hazardous Material 


                                       26

which individually or in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

harmless any Person for or against any Environmental Liabilities and Costs.

                      (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
treated, stored or disposed of "hazardous waste", as that term is defined in the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 6901 ET SEQ., analogous
state Laws, or the regulations promulgated thereunder, such that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries would be required to obtain a permit under said Laws for
such treatment, storage or disposal and the failure to obtain such permit would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                      (n) The Section 203 Approval is valid and in full force
and effect. Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply to the Stock Sale Agreement,
the Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger. No

correct signed copy of such opinion has been, or promptly upon receipt thereof

PURCHASER. Parent and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

                      (a) ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER. Each of
Parent and the Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which each is
incorporated and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and the Purchaser is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
(individually or in the aggregate) would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

                      (b) AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION. Parent and the Purchaser
have the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the Purchaser and the consummation
by Parent and the Purchaser of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and the Purchaser, as applicable. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Parent and the Purchaser and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of each such party, enforceable against each such party
in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy
of specific performance and


                                       31
<PAGE>

injunctive relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent under, (i) the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or the Purchaser, (ii) any
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to Parent or the Purchaser or their respective properties or assets, other than,
in the case of clause (ii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or
Liens that individually or in the aggregate would not (x) impair in any material
respect the ability of Parent and the Purchaser to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or impede the consummation of
any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by Parent or the Purchaser in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent or
the Purchaser, as the case may be, of any of the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for (i) if required, the filing of a premerger
notification and report form under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing with the SEC of
(x) the Offer Documents and (y) such reports under the Exchange Act as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states
in which the Company is qualified to do business, (iv) as may be required by an
applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws, and (v) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) impair, in any material respect, the ability of Parent to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or significantly delay the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                      (c) INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent or the Purchaser expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-1, the

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

                      (d) INTERIM OPERATIONS OF THE PURCHASER. The Purchaser was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions contemplated
hereby and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby.

                      (e) FINANCING. Prior to the expiration of the Offer,

advisor or other Person, other than Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, the fees
and expenses of which will be paid by the Parent, is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Parent or the Purchaser.

                  Section 5.3 REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer and the
Merger, and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from any Governmental Entity and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with any Governmental Entity, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an

                                       38

Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in connection with any filing or submission or other action required to be
made or taken by any Party to effect the Merger and all other Transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company shall not without the prior written consent of
Parent commit to any divestiture transaction and Parent shall not be required to
divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commence to take any action that,
in the reasonable discretion of Parent, limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company or any of its affiliates or
any material portion of the assets of the Company. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall (i)
take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                      (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall give
prompt notice to the other of (i) any of their representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect
(including in the case of representations or warranties receiving knowledge of
any fact, event or circumstance which may cause any representation qualified as
to the knowledge to be or become untrue or inaccurate in any respect) or (ii)
the failure by them to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by them under
this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the


                                       39
<PAGE>

conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

                  Section 5.4 NO SOLICITATION. The Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize (and shall use its
best efforts not to permit) any officer, director or employee of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage
the submission of, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, if in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors, after receiving advice from outside legal counsel to the Company,
such failure to act would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable law, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 5.4(c),
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company to any Person pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions similar to the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in negotiations regarding such
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means (i)
any bona fide proposal or offer from any Person relating to any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial part of the assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any class of equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning shares of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all of the
assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other transaction the consummation of
which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the Offer or the Merger or which would reasonably be expected
to dilute materially the benefits to Parent 


                                       40
<PAGE>

of the Transactions contemplated hereby which (ii) the Company's Board of
Directors reasonably determines in good faith (based on advice of its financial
advisors) is more favorable to all of the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger (taking into account any
improvements to the Offer and the Merger proposed in writing by Parent).

                      (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(b), neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or the Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Board of
Directors or any such committee of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal
or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the time of acceptance
by the Purchaser for payment of Shares in the Offer if in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors, and after receiving advice from outside
legal counsel to the Company, failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, the Board
of Directors may (subject to the terms of this and the following sentences)
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, this Agreement
or the Merger, approve or recommend a Takeover Proposal, or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal, in each case at any time
following delivery by the Company to Parent of written notice (a "Notice of
Takeover Proposal") advising Parent that the Board of Directors has received a
Takeover Proposal, and specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal and identifying the Person making such Takeover Proposal
unless the Takeover Proposal by its terms prohibits disclosure.

                      (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraph (b) (i) the Company shall advise Parent of any request for
information, and the material terms and conditions of such request and the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal if allowed by the
Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and (ii) the Company will keep Parent fully
informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments)
of any such request or inquiry.

                  Section 5.5 PUBLICITY. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable to
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company, Parent nor any of their respective affiliates shall issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior consultation of the other party.

                  Section 5.6 TRANSFER TAXES. All liability for transfer or
other similar Taxes arising out of or related to the Offer and the Merger or the
consummation of any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and due to
the property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by the Company, and the Company shall file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes which are due,
and, to the extent appropriate or required by law, the stockholders of the
Company shall cooperate with respect to the filing of such Tax Returns.

                  Section 5.7 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, in no event shall the Section 203 Approval be
withdrawn, revoked or modified by the Board of Directors of the Company. If any
state takeover statute other than Section 203 of the DGCL becomes or is deemed
to become applicable to the Stock Sale Agreement, the Offer, the acquisition of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, the Company shall take all action
necessary to render such statute inapplicable to all of the foregoing.

                  Section 5.8 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

                      (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company,
unless such modification is required by law.

                      (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and
hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages and liabilities incurred in connection with, and amounts paid in
settlement of, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and wherever asserted, bought
or filed, (x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions or alleged
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the same
extent as provided in the respective Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of
the Company or the Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof, in each case
for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any
period after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements
therefor are received, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that, in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of any
and all such claims. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law
firm to represent them with respect to any single action unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the 


                                       43
<PAGE>

positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. The indemnity agreements of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation in this Section 5.8(b) shall extend, on the
same terms to, and shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by,
each person or entity who controls, or in the past controlled, any present or
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                      (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if
available, directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons
who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (a copy of which has been made available to Parent) on terms
(including the amounts of coverage and the amounts of deductibles, if any) that
are comparable to the terms now applicable to directors and officers of Parent,
or, if more favorable to the Company's directors and officers, the terms now
applicable to them under the Company's current policies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that if the premium for such coverage exceeds
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy with
the greatest coverage available for such 200% of the annual premium.

                      (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8.

                      (e) This Section shall survive the consummation of the
Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties. In the event that Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges into any other person or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then and in such case, proper
provisions shall be 


                                       44
<PAGE>

made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(as the case may be) assume the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this Section.

Purchaser. The failure by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                           STOCKHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIONS. Each of the
Stockholders severally represents and warrants to the Parent (a) that such
Stockholder has the power and authority (or the capacity if an individual) to
execute and deliver this Agreement, (b) that, if a corporation, partnership or
other entity, this Agreement has been duly authorized by all requisite action on
the part of the Stockholder, (c) that the Stockholder has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a valid and binding agreement,
enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms, (d) that
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation by such Stockholder
of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a violation of, or
conflict with, or default under, any contract, commitment, agreement,
understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which such Stockholder
is a party or by


<PAGE>

which such Stockholder is bound and, if the Stockholder is a corporation,
partnership or other entity, the organizational documents thereof, (e) that on
the date hereof such Stockholder has good and valid title to the number of
Shares set forth opposite such Stockholder's name on Schedule A hereto (the
"Stockholder's Shares"), free and clear of all claims, liens, charges,
encumbrances and security interests, without any restrictions on the voting
rights of such Stockholder's Shares, (f) that there are no options or rights to
purchase or acquire, or agreements relating to, any of such Stockholder's Shares
except pursuant to this Agreement, and (g) that the number of Shares set forth
in Schedule A hereto opposite the name of such Stockholder constitutes all of
the Shares owned beneficially or of record by such Stockholder.

                           PARENT'S REPRESENTATIONS. The Parent represents and
warrants to each of the Stockholders that the Parent has duly authorized,
executed and delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a valid and binding
agreement, enforceable against the Parent in accordance with its terms.

                           SALE OF SHARES. In the event that within 9 months
following the date hereof and the Parent shall be entitled to the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.1(b) of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder shall
sell, transfer or otherwise commit to dispose any or all of such Shares to any
party other than the Parent or an affiliate of the Parent (a "Sale") and realize
a Profit (as defined below) from such Sale, then the Stockholder shall pay to
the Parent an amount equal to the Profit. Such amount shall be paid to the
Parent promptly following the receipt of proceeds by the Stockholder or its
affiliates from such Sale. The term "Profit" shall mean the excess, if any, of
(a) the aggregate consideration received by the Stock holder or its affiliates
in connection with the Sale over (b) the number of Shares sold, transferred or
disposed of in connection with the Sale multiplied by the Offer Price.

                           CHANGES IN SHARES. In the event of a stock dividend
or distribution, or any change in the Company's Common Stock by reason of any
stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or
the like, the term "Shares" shall refer to and include the Shares as well as all
such stock dividends and distributions and any shares into which or for which
any or all of the Shares may be changed or exchanged. Each Stockholder's Shares
shall include all Shares acquired after the date hereof by such Stockholder and
all dividends or distributions in respect of the Stockholder's Shares.

                           LEGEND. As soon as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, each Stockholder shall surrender the certificates representing
such Stockholder's Shares to the Parent so that the following legend may be
placed on such certificates:

                  "The shares of capital stock represented by this certificate


<PAGE>

         are subject to a Stock Sale Agreement, dated as of February 28, 1998,
         between Sunbeam Corporation and [the Stockholder]."

                           SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT. The parties hereto acknowledge
that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement and
that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be specifically enforceable, in
addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity.

                           BROKERAGE FEES. Each of the Stockholders and the
Parent, in connection with the transaction contemplated herein, severally agree
to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations with respect to any brokerage fees, commissions or
finders' fees asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement
alleged to have been made by such party or its affiliate.

                           EXPENSES. Each party hereto shall pay its own
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement.

                           SURVIVAL. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, all representations, warranties and agreements made by each of
the Stock holders in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any party
hereto.

                           STOP TRANSFER. Each of the Stockholders shall not
request that the Company register the transfer (book-entry or otherwise) of any
certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shares, unless
such transfer is made in compliance with this Agreement.

                           FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, at the other
party's request and without further consideration, each party hereto shall
execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further lawful
action as may be necessary or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                           MISCELLANEOUS.

                                    AMENDMENT, ETC. This Agreement may not be
modified, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

                                    ASSIGNMENT. No party to this Agreement may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
consent of the other parties except that the rights and obligations of the
Parent may be assigned by the Parent to Purchaser or any of its other wholly
owned


<PAGE>

subsidiaries but no such transfer shall relieve the Parent of its obligations
hereunder if such transferee does not perform such obligations.

                                    BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to the Shares and shall be binding upon any
person or entity to which legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares shall
pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding any transfer of
Shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all
obligations under this Agreement of the transferor.

                                    NOTICES. All notices, claims, requests,
demands and other communications hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed
to have been duly given upon receipt as follows:

                  (a)      If to the Parent, to:

                                    Attention: Blaine V. Fogg, Esq.

                  (b)      If to the Stockholder, to such Stock holder at the
                           address set forth under his name in Schedule A.

or to such other address as the person to whom notice is to be given may have

                                    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

                                    GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable Delaware
principles of conflicts of law.


<PAGE>

                                    TERMINATION. Except for Sections 7, 8 and 9
hereof, this Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the purchase of
each Stockholder's Shares pursuant to the Offer or through the Merger and (ii)
three years from the date hereof.

                                    REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights, powers and
remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of
any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise
of any other such right, power or remedy by such party.

                                    NO WAIVER. The failure of any party hereto
to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon
compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any
custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not
constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other
right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

<PAGE>

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each Stockholder and a duly authorized officer of the Parent on the
day and year first written above.

                         SUNBEAM /REGISTERED TRADEMARK/


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

                          SUNBEAM COMPLETES RECORD YEAR
                     FOR SALES, EARNINGS & GLOBAL EXPANSION

DELRAY BEACH, FLORIDA JANUARY 28, 1998 - Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE:SOC) today an
nounced record sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and full year 1997.
Sales for the quarter were $338 million, reflecting a 30.6% increase over the
prior year period on a comparable basis (excluding discontinued businesses and
divested product lines). Before the 1996 special charges taken by the Company to
restructure and reposition Sunbeam, earnings per share (diluted) from continuing
operations of $0.47 were $0.50 ahead of the loss of $0.03 reported in the fourth
quar ter last year. Including these charges earnings per share (diluted) rose
$2.76 above the reported $2.29 loss reported in 1996. On a year to date basis,
revenue of $1.168 billion was 22.4% above 1996 on a comparable basis and
earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations of $1.41 was $1.51 above
the loss of $0.10 reported in 1996, excluding special charges. For the full year
of 1997, earnings per share (diluted) rose $3.78 from the loss of $2.37 reported
in 1996.

1997 Highlights -- During 1997, the Company completed its restructuring program
and initiated a growth strategy that has generated consistent quarterly double
digit sales growth throughout the year. The company exited all its non-core
businesses in 1997, closed 18 factories, 43 warehouses and 5 headquarters,
reduced employment by approximately 50% (half of which reflects reductions
related to the disposition of non-core businesses) and substantially reduced its
SKU offerings as part of its restructuring program. Concurrent with the
restructuring program, the Company also implemented a three year growth plan to
strengthen the Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brand names and expand distribution
globally. Albert J. Dunlap, Sunbeam's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said
"I am very proud of the dramatic turnaround that we have achieved at Sunbeam in
such a short period of time as we continue to execute against our three year
growth plans. Our continu ous sales increases of 13%, 17%, 28% and 31% in the
four quarters of 1997, for an overall sales increase of 22% for the year, are a
clear indication that our strategy is working."

The Company's three year strategy to achieve $1 billion in revenue growth, which
it embarked upon in 1997, was fueled by the addition of 25 international
distribution/license agreements, the introduction of 35 new U.S. products and 54
new international products along with the contribu tion from 22 factory outlet
stores. "We experienced sales growth in all major channels of distri bution, in
all regions of the world and in each of our five global businesses, and we
gained market share in all of our key product categories, reversing a three year
downward trend, " said Mr. Dunlap. Sales to the Company's top 10 retailers were
up 15% and 22% in the latest quarter and



<PAGE>

full year, respectively. International sales which are projected to contribute
40% of the Company's three year growth goal, were up 42%, and 34% for the
quarter and full year, respectively. Leading the sales growth internationally
was the Asia/Pacific region, up 425%, and the Latin American region, up 32%.
"The primary catalyst for this growth has been our ability to improve customer
service levels and introduce innovative and differentiated new products at an
accelerated pace. As part of the restructuring we implemented a new product
development process that has enabled us to reduce new product development time
from over 2 years to approximately 6 months," said Mr. Dunlap.

"Equally as important as our strong top line growth was the remarkable
improvement in operating margins, year over year, and the continuous margin
expansion we delivered through-out the year. We set a three year goal to have
20% operating margins, and we were essentially at that level in the 3rd and 4th
quarters this year," said Mr. Dunlap. The Company's operating margins of 20% in
the 4th quarter and 17% for the full year reflect the numerous initiatives
associated with the restructuring program. "I am pleased with the pace of
improvements in our financial performance and expect continued margin
enhancement in 1998," Mr. Dunlap said.

1998 Goals -- The Company announced its goals for 1998, which anticipate
increases in sales and margins at rates above those experienced in 1997. Mr.
Dunlap, commenting on the Company's 1998 revenue goals, said, "We have
established sales growth goals that should exceed the impres sive results
reported in 1997. In 1998 we will continue our global expansion with the
addition of 30 new global products, a dozen more international
distribution/license agreements and 10 more outlet stores. We expect to double
our media advertising spending to stimulate increased consumer pull for our
products and introduce new in-store merchandising programs to assist our retail
partners in the promotion and support of our aggressive growth goals." The
Company expects to introduce new products in 1998 that will strengthen its
global product lines, and market positions, by focusing on technological
innovation that satisfies chronic consumer needs.

Commenting on the effect of the economic situation in Asia on the Company's
international growth plans, Mr. Dunlap stated, "Sunbeam has an advantage in that
we started from a very low base. Unlike other companies which have exported
heavily to Asia for years, we still have an ex cellent opportunity to build our
business rapidly in that region of the world. Our plans are to ini tially sell
our most highly differentiated products in Asia, like our electric blankets,
blenders, wa ter and air purifiers, hair clippers and ToastLogic(R) products.
Many of the products we will sell there can be sourced from Asian OEM
manufacturers, providing flexibility to enhance our growth opportunities in the
Asia/Pacific region."

Mr. Dunlap said, "I am confident that we have the right initiatives in place to
achieve our goals and further expand operating margins in 1998." The Company
plans to increase the amount of out-sourcing in 1998 to help support its sales
growth objectives for the Asia/Pacific region and to allow for added capacity
without adding bricks and mortar to its existing 8 factories. "Currently our
make/buy composition is around 70/30 and I have set a goal for the Company to
source around 50% of its products and components by the end of 1998," said Mr.
Dunlap.

Mr. Dunlap added, "I have always believed that a merger or acquisition unleashes
a quantum leap in creating shareholder value, and I am very eager to make this
strategic move in the first half of 1998. We continue to work towards finalizing
our plans for merging with, or acquiring, one or more companies that will
provide added value to all shareholders. We also remain open to a sale of the
Company if that would produce greater value for our shareholders."

Sunbeam Corporation is a leading consumer products company that designs,
manufactures and markets, nationally and internationally, a diverse portfolio of
brand name products. The Com pany's Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brands have been
household names for generations, both domesti cally and abroad, and the Company
is a market leader in many of its product categories.

                    COLEMAN, SIGNATURE BRANDS AND FIRST ALERT
                *****AL DUNLAP SIGNS NEW THREE YEAR CONTRACT*****

DELRAY BEACH, FL, MARCH 2, 1998 - Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE: SOC) initiated an
aggressive expansion strategy today with the announcement of the acquisitions of
three separate market leading durable consumer product companies. These
transactions will enhance shareholder value by nearly tripling the Company's
annual revenues, expanding its geographic presence, complementing its existing
product lines and leveraging operational synergies. The three transactions will
total approximately $2.5 billion and will be meaningfully accretive to Sunbeam's
earnings within twelve months. The transactions are subject to regulatory
approvals and other customary conditions and are expected to close within the
next two months.

The Coleman Company, Inc. (NYSE: CLN), with 1997 revenues of $1.1 billion is the
global leader in outdoor recreation and hardware products with powerful brands
such as Coleman/registered trademark/, Powermate/registered trademark/, Camping
Gaz/registered trademark/ and Eastpak/registered trademark/. The Company, based
in Wichita, KS, operates 17 manufacturing facilities and employs approximately
6,000 people around the world. The transaction is valued at approximately $2.0
billion, consisting of approximately $815 million in Sunbeam stock and the
balance in debt financing. Shareholders of The Coleman Company, Inc. will
receive $6.44 in cash and 0.5677 shares of Sunbeam stock for each share of
Coleman stock.

Signature Brands USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: SIGB), with 1997 revenues of $279 million,
is the North American leader in coffee makers marketed under the Mr.
Coffee/registered trademark/ brand name and is a leader in consumer health
products marketed under the Health o meter/registered trademark/ brand. The
Company, based in Glenwillow, OH, operates two manufacturing facilities and
employs approximately 1,000 people. The transaction is valued at approximately
$250 million consisting of a cash tender offer of $8.25 per SIGB share and the

growth. These three separate transactions

represent the next phase of our plan to create value for Sunbeam's shareholders.
We looked at various alternatives to increase shareholder value. Ultimately we
decided there is phenomenal value to be created in assuming the leadership role
in consolidating the industries in which we compete. These acquisitions enable
us to accelerate our growth rate by expanding our geographic presence, entering
new product lines and leveraging the strength of dominant brand names such as
Coleman/registered trademark/, Camping Gaz/registered trademark/,
Eastpak/registered trademark/, First Alert/registered trademark/, Mr.
Coffee/registered trademark/, and Health o meter/registered trademark/, along
with Sunbeam/registered trademark/, Oster/registered trademark/ and
Grillmaster."

Mr. Dunlap added, "Our strategy is to become the global leader in the durable
consumer products industry through continued internal growth augmented by
further strategic acquisitions of high quality consumer brands. Our proven track
record coupled with our financial strength will enable us to successfully
execute this strategy."

The Company anticipates initial synergies of approximately $150 million which
will result in a substantial EPS accretion in 1999. A one time charge is
expected in 1998 in order to restructure and consolidate these three companies
into Sunbeam.

Additionally, the Company announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Albert J. Dunlap, along with Executive Vice Presidents Russell A. Kersh and
David C. Fannin have all renewed their commitment to the Company by signing new
three year employment contracts. Mr. Kersh was named to the new position of vice
chairman of Sunbeam. Mr. Dunlap stated, "I am eager to continue to create
tremendous value for our shareholders by building the leading durable consumer
products company in the world. This new employment agreement will put to rest
any rumors that I would leave the Company."

"This is a fantastic situation for all Sunbeam shareholders giving them the
opportunity to participate in the wealth that Al Dunlap and his team are
building," said Ronald O. Perelman, who will become Sunbeam's second largest
shareholder after the transaction. "Coleman will thrive as part of Sunbeam's
unbeatable family of brands," added Mr. Perelman.

Michael Price, president and chief executive officer of Franklin Mutual Series
Fund, Sunbeam's largest shareholder, praised the transactions and new contracts.
"With the simultaneous acquisitions of these three publicly traded companies,
Sunbeam is launching into a bold new phase as the consolidator in its
industries," Mr. Price said. "Utilizing Al's unique ability to restructure and
reposition companies, the opportunities for operating synergies and incremental
sales growth is substantial. Al's renewed commitment indicates to me that the
best is yet to come for Sunbeam and its shareholders," Mr. Price added.
