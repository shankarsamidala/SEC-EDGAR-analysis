IMPORTANT NOTE - COMBINED FILING FOR AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY AND AMERICAN
                 PAD & PAPER COMPANY OF DELAWARE, INC.

         American Pad & Paper Company (the "Company") and American Pad & Paper
Company of Delaware, Inc. (AP&P Delaware) are filing a combined Annual Report
on Form 10-K in accordance with general instruction J to Form 10-K. The Company
owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of AP&P Delaware. The Company has
27,435,839 shares of outstanding common stock and is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. AP&P Delaware has issued $130 million of 13% Senior
Subordinated Notes ("Notes") which trade on the over the counter market. The
Company is a holding company with no operations and owns 100% of the
outstanding common shares of WR Acquisition, Inc. ("WR Acquisition"). WR
Acquisition is also a holding company with no operations which owns 100% of the
outstanding common shares of AP&P Delaware. AP&P Delaware is the operating
company in which all the operations of the Company take place. There are no
differences between the Company and AP&P Delaware except as just described. The
Company has followed full push-down accounting for the financial statements of
AP&P Delaware such that the only differences between the two registrants relate
to the capital structure just described. The management of the Company has
determined that it would not be meaningful to the holders of the Company's
common stock or to the holders of AP&P Delaware's Notes to receive Annual
Reports on Form 10-K which are different and, as a result, the Company has
elected to file only one Form 10-K and only one set of consolidated financial
statements for both registrants.

ITEM 1   BUSINESS

GENERAL

         The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
paper-based office products (excluding copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70
billion North American office products industry. The Company offers a broad
product line including nationally branded and private label writing pads, file
folders, envelopes, machine papers and other office products. Through its Ampad
division, the Company is among the largest and most important suppliers of pads
and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies, machine papers and
retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing office products
distributors. Established in 1888, the Company's Ampad division has been a
leading supplier of pads and other paper-based writing products throughout its
history. Acquired in October 1995, the Company's Williamhouse division is the
leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business envelopes
and machine papers to paper merchants/distributors. The Company maintains
several nationally-recognized brand names such as Ampad, Century, Embassy,
Evidence, Gold Fibre, Huxley, Karolton, Kent, Peel & Seel, SCM, Williamhouse
and World Fibre. The Company's strategy is to grow by focusing on the largest
and fastest growing office product distribution channels, making acquisitions,
introducing new product lines, broadening product distribution across its
channels and maintaining its position among the lowest-cost manufacturers in
the industry. As a result of this strategy, the Company's net sales have grown
at a compound annual rate of approximately 52.9% from 1992 to 1996.

         Since the mid-1980s, the office products industry has experienced
significant changes in the channels through which office products are
distributed such as the emergence of new channels, including national office
products superstores, national contract stationers and mass merchandisers, and
consolidation within these and other channels. As a result of these changes,
approximately 6,800 office product distributors existed in 1994 compared with
approximately 13,300 in 1987. The channels through which office products are
distributed from the manufacturer to the end-user include retail channels such
as national office products superstores, mass merchandisers and warehouse
clubs; commercial channels such as national contract stationers; paper
merchants/distributors; and other channels such as regional distributors,
school campuses and direct mail. The Company believes that sales of office
products through retail channels are approximately $20 billion to $25 billion.
The three dominant national superstores (Office Depot,




                                      14
<PAGE>   3

OfficeMax and Staples) have experienced significant growth over the past three
years. Principally through the acquisition of smaller, regional contract
stationers, national contract stationers (including Boise Cascade Office
Products, BT Office Products, Corporate Express, U.S. Office Products and the
contract stationer divisions of Office Depot and Staples) have grown more
rapidly than other commercial channels. Certain office products, particularly
envelopes, are sold predominantly through paper merchants/distributors or
directly to end users. Paper merchants/distributors currently account for
approximately 30% of the envelope market. The four largest paper merchants
(Nationwide, ResourceNet, Unisource and Zellerbach) have experienced
significant growth primarily through consolidation.

         The Company has targeted and will continue to target those customers
driving consolidation in the retail, commercial and paper merchant distribution
channels and believes that it is uniquely positioned to meet the special
requirements of these customers. These customers seek suppliers, such as the
Company, who are able to offer broad product lines, higher value-added
innovative products, national distribution capabilities, low costs and reliable
service. Furthermore, as these customers continue to grow and as they
consolidate their supplier bases, the Company's ability to meet their special
requirements becomes an increasingly important competitive advantage.
Recognizing Ampad's potential for growth through the changing distribution
channels, Bain Capital, Inc. ("Bain Capital") and management formed the Company
and purchased Ampad from Mead Corporation ("Mead") in 1992. Since that time,
management has enhanced the Company's scale, broadened its product line,
expanded upon its national presence and strengthened its distribution
capabilities through acquisition and innovation while simultaneously delivering
higher customer service levels. As a result, the Company's net sales through
the most rapidly growing retail and commercial channels increased from $8.8
million in 1992 to $200.5 million in 1996.

HISTORY

         From 1986 to 1992, Ampad operated as a subsidiary of Mead. On July 31,
1992, the Company acquired Ampad from Mead in an acquisition led by Bain
Capital and senior management. Since the acquisition, management has enhanced
the Company's scale, broadened its product line, expanded upon its national
presence and strengthened its distribution capabilities through acquisition and
innovation while simultaneously delivering higher customer service levels. In
July 1994, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
SCM, one of the industry leaders in hanging files and writing products. In
August 1995, the Company acquired the file folder and file product lines of
American Trading and Production Corporation's ("Atapco") Globe-Weis office
products division. Prior to the acquisition, Atapco was one of the leading
providers of file folders and hanging files to office product superstores. The
acquisitions of the SCM and Globe-Weis product lines further strengthened the
Company's position in the filing supplies and writing products categories.

         In October 1995, the Company acquired WR Acquisition and its wholly
owned subsidiary, Williamhouse-Regency of Delaware, Inc., collectively referred
to as "Williamhouse," for an aggregate purchase price (including assumption of
debt of approximately $152.9 million) of approximately $300.0 million, plus
reimbursement of certain expenses. Williamhouse is a leading supplier to many
of the largest and fastest growing paper merchants/distributors. The Company's
management identified the Regency Division of Williamhouse as a nonstrategic
asset following the Williamhouse acquisition and, on June 27, 1996, completed
the sale of the Regency Division for approximately $47.9 million in gross
proceeds.

         On June 28, 1996, the Company acquired Niagara Envelope Company, Inc.
("Niagara") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $48.2 million,
plus $5.0 million paid at closing under a one-year consulting services
agreement. Niagara supplies mill branded, specialty and commodity envelopes to
paper merchants/distributors through four manufacturing facilities located near
Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas and Denver. Niagara had 1995 net sales of
approximately $106.0 million and operating income of approximately $8.5
million. The Company believes that the Niagara acquisition will strengthen the




                                      15
<PAGE>   4

Company's distribution capabilities in the Midwest, provide additional
manufacturing capacity and provide opportunities to achieve operating
improvements through the consolidation of Niagara's operations with those of
the Company.

         On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied, Inc.
("Shade/Allied") for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million. Shade/Allied
supplies continuous forms to paper merchants/distributors and retail customers
through four manufacturing facilities located near Green Bay, Seattle, Atlanta
and Philadelphia. Shade/Allied realized net sales of approximately $90 million
in 1996. The Company believes that the Shade/Allied acquisition will strengthen
its presence in a fourth major product category, machine papers.

         Although the Company regularly engages in discussions with companies
regarding potential acquisitions, it currently does not have any agreements or
understandings relating to any future acquisitions.

         The Company's principal executive offices are located at 17304 Preston
Road, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75252 and its telephone number is (972)
733-6200.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

         The combination of the Company's products and customers distinguishes
it as a leading manufacturer and marketer of paper-based office products
(excluding copy paper) in North America. The Company attributes this position
and its continued opportunities for growth and profitability to the following
competitive strengths:

o  Market Leader. The Company has achieved market leadership in core products
   sold to customers in the largest and fastest growing office products
   channels by offering one of the broadest assortments of high quality
   products in the industry. Furthermore, the Company enjoys national brand
   awareness in many of its product lines, including Ampad, Century, Embassy,
   Evidence, Gold Fibre, Huxley, Karolton, Kent, Peel & Seel, SCM, Williamhouse
   and World Fibre.

o  Well-Positioned and Diversified Customer Base. The Company has substantial
   opportunities for growth within several distribution channels of the office
   products industry. The Company has focused on the largest and fastest
   growing office products channels. Several of the Company's largest
   customers, such as Boise Cascade Office Products, BT Office Products,
   Corporate Express, Office Depot, OfficeMax and Staples, are expected by
   industry analysts to experience annual revenue growth of 15% to 35% over the
   next five years. The Company's Williamhouse division maintains particularly
   strong relationships with the largest and fastest growing paper
   merchants/distributors in the market, including Nationwide, ResourceNet,
   Unisource and Zellerbach. The Company also maintains strong customer
   relationships across all of the other office products distribution channels,
   including mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, office products wholesalers
   and independent dealers.

o  National Scale and Service Capability. The Company's extensive product
   line, multiple brands and broad price point coverage provide significant
   advantages and economies of scale in selling to and servicing its customers.
   The Company has become an increasingly important strategic partner to its
   customers as they seek higher value-added products, simplify their
   purchasing organizations and consolidate their relationships among selected
   national suppliers. The Company's national presence and network of 21
   strategically located manufacturing and distribution facilities have enabled
   it to maintain rapid and efficient order fulfillment standards. In addition,
   the Company's advanced EDI capabilities enable it to meet its customers' EDI
   requirements, executing automated transactions rapidly, efficiently and
   accurately.





                                      16
<PAGE>   5

o  Innovation/New Products. The Company has introduced several innovative
   products as part of its marketing strategy to differentiate itself from
   other suppliers and enhance profitability. Recent examples include Gold
   Fibre classic and designer notebooks, Papers with a Purpose, World Fibre
   ground-wood writing pads and Peel & Seel envelopes. Products introduced
   since 1992 accounted for over $155 million of the Company's 1996 net sales.
   The Company's brand recognition and presence with its national customers
   allows it to more easily introduce new or acquired product lines to those
   customers.

o  Low-Cost Manufacturer. The Company believes it is among the lowest-cost
   manufacturers of paper-based office products in the industry. The Company
   ensures its low-cost manufacturing position through its paper purchasing and
   distribution advantages as well as its maintenance of modern and efficient
   manufacturing technology and a high quality work force. The Company has been
   successful in reducing costs with each of its acquisitions in the last three
   years by continually streamlining its manufacturing processes and overhead
   structure. From 1992 to 1996, the Company reduced its fixed manufacturing
   costs from 7.4% to 5.0% of net sales and its selling, general and
   administrative expenses from 10.0% to 8.2% of net sales.

o  Purchasing Advantages. The Company has strong relationships with most of
   the country's largest paper mills, many of which have been conducting
   business with the Company for more than 30 years. The Company is one of the
   largest purchasers of the principal paper grades used in its manufacturing
   operations. In addition, the Company has the largest number of designated
   mill relationships which involve some of the largest and most recognized
   paper mill brands such as Hammermill, Hopper, Neenah and Strathmore.

GROWTH STRATEGY

         The Company's strategy is to maintain and strengthen its leadership
position by focusing on the following:

o   Focus on Rapidly Growing Customers. The Company serves many of the largest
    and best positioned customers in the office products market segment
    including national office products superstores, mass merchandisers and
    warehouse clubs, national contract stationers and national paper
    merchants/distributors. Anticipating further consolidation in the office
    products industry, the Company expects that its national scope and broad
    product line will be increasingly important in meeting the needs of its
    customers. The Company will continue to target those customers driving
    consolidation in the office products industry.

o   Continue to Introduce New Products. New, higher value-added products give
    the Company a greater selection to offer its customers and improve product
    line profitability for both the Company and its customers. The Company
    plans to differentiate itself from other suppliers and improve
    profitability through product innovation, differentiation and line
    extensions.

o   Pursue Complementary Product Line and Strategic Acquisitions. The office
    products industry is highly fragmented despite continuing consolidation
    among its manufacturers. The Company is leading consolidation among
    manufacturers of writing products, filing supplies, envelopes and machine
    papers. The SCM and Williamhouse acquisitions broadened the Company's
    product line to include filing products and envelopes and enhanced its
    presence in the growing distribution channels. The Globe-Weis acquisition
    and the Niagara acquisition demonstrate its commitment to strengthening its
    competitive and strategic position within its markets. The Company believes
    that there are significant opportunities to acquire companies in both its
    existing and complementary product lines. In addition, the Company intends
    to enter new office products markets through acquisitions of established
    companies in those markets.






                                      17
<PAGE>   6

o   Broaden Product Distribution. The Company's market presence and
    distribution strengths uniquely position it to sell new or acquired product
    lines across its distribution channels, including national office products
    superstores, national contract stationers, office product wholesalers and
    mass merchandisers. As an important part of its growth strategy, for
    example, the Company has successfully introduced the envelope product lines
    acquired in the Williamhouse and Niagara acquisitions, previously
    distributed primarily through paper merchants/distributors, to the Ampad
    division's distribution channels under the Ampad and private label names.

RECENT ACQUISITION

         On February 11, 1997, the Company completed its acquisition of
Shade/Allied for approximately $49.5 million. Based in Green Bay, Wisconsin,
Shade/Allied manufactures machine paper, primarily continuous computer forms,
in facilities in four states. This acquisition signals entry into machine
papers, the Company's fourth product category.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

         Pads and Other Paper-Based Writing Products. The Company believes is
one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of paper-based writing products
(excluding copy paper) in North America, offering more than 2,400 SKUs of
writing pads, notebooks and specialty papers. Many of the Company's writing
products are available in multiple sizes, grades of paper (including recycled),
and colors and with glued, perforated tops or wire binding. All writing
products are offered under the Ampad brand name or a retailer's private label.
During the past three years, the Company has focused on the introduction of new
and innovative products such as Gold Fibre classic and designer notebooks,
Papers with a Purpose and World Fibre ground-wood writing pads. The Company has
also created innovative packaging, especially for sale through warehouse clubs
(bulk and crate packaging), superstores and mass merchandisers.

         Filing Supplies. The Company is one of the three largest manufacturers
of filing supplies in North America. The product line includes more than 800
SKUs of filing supplies including file folders, hanging files, index cards and
expandable folders under the SCM and Globe-Weis brand names. The Company has
been expanding its market share in filing supplies by focusing its sales
efforts on large retail customers and contract stationers, where its writing
products enjoy the leading market share position.

         Envelopes. The Company is the largest manufacturer of envelopes
serving the paper merchant/distributor and office products superstore channels
and sold over 18 billion envelopes in 1996. The Company's broad envelope
product line includes products manufactured from mill branded paper, which is
paper unique in color and texture to a particular mill, typically with an
identifying watermark. The Company is the designated envelope manufacturer for
33 mill brands, which is approximately twice as many as its nearest competitor.
These brands include the Hammermill, Strathmore and Beckett divisions of
International Paper Company, the Hopper division of Georgia Pacific
Corporation, the Neenah division of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and the Gilbert
division of Mead.

         The Company also produces a wide variety of standard size and
specialty envelopes made from commodity paper and Tyvek(R) (a high density
polyurethane based product made by Du Pont), including booklet and catalog
mailing envelopes, envelopes closable by metal clasp or button-and-string, Peel
& Seel (pressure sensitive adhesion) envelopes, and giant, X-ray and remittance
envelopes. The Company offers in excess of 30,000 SKUs of envelopes (which the
Company believes is more than any of its competitors), providing its customers
with a wide choice of paper grades, colors and sizes.

         Machine Papers. The Company is among the leading manufacturers of
machine papers, a product category defined by the Company which includes inkjet
papers, printed formats, fine papers, such as cotton content and laid papers,
as well as continuous forms.







                                      18
<PAGE>   7

         Invitations and Announcements. The Company is among the largest
manufacturers of invitations and announcements, Christmas and holiday cards,
and presentation folders. These products are sold principally to paper
merchants/distributors, personalizing businesses (including the former Regency
Division), and other wholesale outlets throughout the United States. The
Company offers a wide variety of such products, primarily made from the same
mill branded grades of paper used in manufacturing envelopes.

         The following chart illustrates the Company's principal products and
customers and selected brands in its primary business segments:

SALES, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING

         The Company markets its broad range of products to a wide variety of
customers. In 1996, one customer, Staples, Inc., accounted for 10.8% of the
Company's net sales.

         The Company markets its writing products, filing supplies, retail
envelopes and machine papers through virtually every channel of distribution
for paper-based office products including the largest mass merchant retailers,
office product superstores, warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, paper
merchants/distributors and other traditional outlets for office supplies such
as office product wholesalers, independent dealers, buying groups and mail
order firms.

         The Company sells its business envelopes and machine papers
principally to paper merchants/distributors and other wholesale outlets
throughout the United States, primarily through an in-house sales force. In
addition, mill branded products are sold directly to personalizing businesses
(including the former Regency Division). The Company currently employs sales
representatives throughout the United States and sells products to over 2,000
paper merchants/distributors in the United States and Canada. The Williamhouse
acquisition provided the Company with the ability to manufacture and distribute
retail envelopes directly to the Ampad division customers under the Ampad and
private label names.

         The following chart illustrates some of the Company's key customers:

         The Company has targeted and will continue to target those customers
driving consolidation in the office products industry and believes that it is
uniquely positioned to meet the special requirements of these customers in the
growing distribution channels of the office products industry. These customers
seek suppliers, such as the Company, who are able to offer broad product lines,
higher value-added innovative products, national distribution capabilities, low
costs and reliable service. Furthermore, as these customers continue to grow
and they consolidate their supplier bases, the Company's ability to meet their
special requirements will be an increasingly important competitive advantage.
Recognizing Ampad's potential for growth through the changing distribution
channels, Bain Capital and management purchased the Company from Mead in 1992.
Since that time, management has enhanced the Company's scale, broadened its
product line, expanded upon its national presence and strengthened its
distribution capabilities through acquisition and innovation while
simultaneously delivering higher customer service levels. As a result, the
Company's sales through the most rapidly growing retail and commercial channels
increased from $8.8 million in 1992 to $200.6 million in 1996. For the same
period on a pro forma basis, the Company's sales to the four largest paper
merchants/distributors increased from $75.6 million to $118.4 million.

PAPER RAW MATERIAL

                  The Company's principal raw material is paper. While paper
prices have increased by an average of less than 1% annually since 1989,
certain commodity grades have shown considerable price volatility during the
period. This volatility negatively impacted the Company's earnings in 1994,
particularly in the fourth quarter, as a result of the Company's inability to
implement price changes in many of its product lines without giving its
customers advance notification. Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted
new pricing policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the
Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. To date, such policies have
been accepted by customers; however, no assurance can be given that the Company
will continue to be successful in maintaining such pricing policies or that
future price fluctuations in the price of paper will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company. Fluctuations in paper prices can have an effect
on quarterly comparisons of the results of operations and financial condition
of the Company.





                                      20
<PAGE>   9

         The Company has strong relationships with most of the country's
largest paper mills, many of which have been doing business with the Company
for more than 30 years. The Company is one of the largest purchasers of the
principal paper grades used in its manufacturing operations. In addition, the
Company has the largest number of designated mill relationships, which involve
some of the largest and most recognized paper mill brands such as Hammermill,
Hopper, Neenah and Strathmore. The Company believes that these relationships
afford it certain paper purchasing advantages, including stable supply and
favorable pricing arrangements. While these relationships are stable, all but
one of the designated manufacturer arrangements are oral and terminable at will
at the option of either party. There can be no assurance that any of the
supplier or designated manufacturer relationships will not be terminated in the
future. While the Company has been able to obtain sufficient paper supplies
during recent paper shortages and otherwise, the Company is subject to the risk
that it will be unable to purchase sufficient quantities of paper to meet its
production requirements during times of tight supply.

COMPETITION

         The markets for the Company's products are highly competitive.
Competition is based largely on a company's ability to offer a broad range of
products on a regional or national scale at competitive prices and to deliver
these products on a timely basis. The Company has many local and regional
competitors. The markets in which the Company operates have become increasingly
characterized by a limited number of large companies selling under recognized
trade names. These larger companies, including the Company, have the economies
of scale, national presence, management information systems and breadth of
product line required by the major customers. In addition to branded product
lines, manufacturers also produce private-label products, especially in the
context of broader supply relationships with office product superstores and
contract stationers.

         The writing products industry is fragmented, ranging from large
national manufacturers to localized jobbers and printers. A few manufacturers,
including the Company, have developed strong brand name recognition for a
limited number of product lines. Other national companies include Mead, the
Stuart Hall division of Newell Co., Pen-Tab Industries, and the Tops division
of Wallace Computer Services.

         In the filing supplies segment, the Company's key domestic competitors
include Esselte AB and Smead Manufacturing.

         In the machine papers segment, the Company's key domestic competitors
are CST/Bowater, Moore Business Forms and Willamette Industries.

         Envelope manufacturers compete in three distinct channels. In the
paper merchant/distributor channel, where the Company competes, manufacturers
sell a wide variety of mill branded, specialty and commodity envelope products
to paper merchants/distributors. The Company's principal competitor in this
channel is New York/National Envelope Group of National Envelope Corporation, a
private company. Another competitor in this channel is Murray Envelope Corp. In
the direct channel, manufacturers sell customized envelopes directly to high
volume corporate users and mass mailers. Mail-Well is the leading company in
this channel. In the office products channel, manufacturers including Westvaco
and Quality Park produce commodity mailing envelopes for retail sale.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

                  The Company registers some of its material trademarks,
tradenames and copyrights and has acquired patent protection for some of its
proprietary processes. In the opinion of management, the Company has current
trademark rights to conduct its business as now constituted. The Company has
the right to use the Globe-Weis(R) name on a non-exclusive basis through August
1998, pursuant to the 





                                      21
<PAGE>   10

Company's purchase of certain file folder and hanging file assets from Atapco.
The Company does not expect that the loss of the right to use the Globe-Weis(R)
name will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

         As of December 31, 1996, the Company employed a total of 4,105
full-time persons, including 4,037 manufacturing, sales and administrative
personnel and 68 corporate staff members. The Company has added approximately
250 employees as a result of the Shade /Allied acquisition. All the Company's
operations are non-union except for the operations at the facilities located in
Scottdale, Pennsylvania; Miamisburg, Ohio; Appleton, Wisconsin and Holland, New
York which have, in total, approximately 1,100 union employees. The collective
bargaining contracts covering the Company's employees will expire as follows:
the Miamisburg contract expires May 31, 1997; the Appleton contract expires
March 31, 1997; the Scottdale contract expires April 30, 1998 and the Holland
contract expires December 7, 2000. With the exception of a strike at the
Company's Indiana plant, as described below, there have been no work stoppages
at any Company facility during the last five years. The Company believes that
its relations with its employees and unions are satisfactory.

         In July 1994, the Company acquired the writing products and filing
supplies assets of SCM. Work rules and associated costs at SCM's plant in
Indiana were less favorable than those at other plants of the Company. As a
result of management's effort to bring the labor agreement at the Indiana plant
more in line with market labor agreements, a labor strike occurred on September
1, 1994. Consequently, the Company closed the Indiana plant on February 15,
1995 and moved the equipment to other facilities operated by the Company. By
July 1995, all machinery and equipment previously operated in Indiana was
available for production in other facilities of the Company.

BACKLOG

         The Company does not consider backlog to be a significant factor is
its business. Customer orders are generally received between one week and three
months in advance of shipment dates and are satisfied with on hand finished
goods inventory or completed manufacturing within the customers delivery
deadlines.

SEASONALITY

         The majority of the Company's business is not seasonal in nature. The
sale of invitations, announcements, Christmas and holiday cards and
presentation folders is directly affected by the timing of holidays and school
schedules. Sales of these products will typically be highest during the third
and fourth quarters of any year.

ITEM 2   PROPERTIES

PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES

         As of February 28, 1997, the Company operated manufacturing,
distribution, office and warehouse space in the United States with a total
floor area of approximately 4,087,000 square feet. Of this footage,
approximately 849,000 square feet are leased and approximately 2,938,000 square
feet are owned. The Company has five facilities in Fresno, Kosciusko, New
Jersey, and New York City which aggregate approximately 300,000 square feet
which are being subleased to third parties. The Company's lease agreements for
these facilities expire from 1997 through 2009.




                                      22
<PAGE>   11

         To provide a cost efficient supply of products to its customers, the
Company maintains centralized management of nationwide manufacturing and
distribution facilities. Since 1992, the Company has consolidated 13
manufacturing and distribution facilities into 6 facilities. The Company's
management continually evaluates the potential consolidation of manufacturing
and distribution facilities. All of the Company's owned facilities are pledged
as collateral under the Company's bank credit agreement.

         The Company believes that substantially all of its property and
equipment is in good condition and that it has sufficient capacity to meet its
current and projected manufacturing and distribution needs in the foreseeable
future. The following table describes the principal properties of the Company
as of February 28, 1997:

ITEM 3   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company is a party to various litigation matters incidental to the
conduct of its business. Management does not believe that the outcome of any of
the matters in which it is currently involved will have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.


ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS

         The Company is subject to federal, state, and local environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for
management of waste. While there can be no assurance that the Company is at all
times in complete compliance with all such requirements, the Company has made
and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements. The Company spent approximately $7,000 and $100,000 in 1995 and
1996, respectively, on environmental capital projects. The Company estimates
that its environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $50,000 to
$100,000 in each of 1997 and 1998. Thereafter, the Company expects to incur
moderate environmental capital expenditures, which will be higher than
historical levels as a result of the Company's increased size. As is the case
with manufacturers in general, if a release of hazardous substances occurs on
or from the Company's properties or any associated offsite disposal location,
or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of the Company's
properties, the Company may be held liable and the amount of such liability
could be material.

         The City of Industry, California facility of the Company's
Williamhouse division is located within an area of regional groundwater
contamination designated as the San Gabriel Valley National Priority List Area.
The Company does not believe its operations have contributed to the
contamination and to date the Company has not received a notice of potential
liability with respect to that site.

         The Company is aware that one of Niagara's and two of Shade/Allied's
facilities has been the subject of certain soil and groundwater investigations
and that the prior owner of the Niagara and the prior owner of one of the
Shade/Allied facilities have indemnified the Company for certain environmental
liabilities associated with historical use of the property. The Company
currently believes that any environmental liabilities associated with such
facilities would not be material or have been adequately covered by agreements
with the former owners.

         The Company's Ampad division has been named a potentially responsible
party ("PRP") under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), at five waste
disposal sites. The Company settled its liability at four of these sites as a
de minimis party. At the Spectron site in Elkton, Maryland, the Company paid
approximately $1,300 in 1989 as a de minimis settlement for an initial removal
action at the site. In 1995, the Company received a notice of a remedial action
at the site, and based upon its allocation in 1989, expects to be eligible for
a de minimis or de micromis settlement. The Company is aware that Niagara has
been named a PRP at the Envirotek II site in Tonawanda, New York with respect
to which Niagara expects to be eligible for a de minimis settlement. Although
the Company endeavors to manage its wastes carefully, because CERCLA liability
is strict and retroactive, it is possible that in the future the Company may be
identified as a PRP with respect to other waste disposal sites.

         As of March 4, 1997, there were approximately 3,140 holders of common

fiscal year.


DIVIDEND POLICY

         Except as described below, the Company has not declared or paid any
cash or other dividends on its Common Stock and does not expect to pay
dividends for the foreseeable future. Instead, the Company currently intends to
retain earnings to support its growth strategy and reduce indebtedness. As a
holding company, the ability of the Company to pay dividends in the future is
dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from its principal
operating subsidiary, AP&P Delaware. The payment of dividends by AP&P Delaware
to the Company for purposes of paying dividends to holders of Common Stock is
prohibited by the bank credit agreement and restricted by the indenture related
to the Notes. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the
discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among
other factors, the Company's results of operations, financial condition,
capital requirements and contractual restrictions.

         In October 1995, the Company declared a stock dividend on its
outstanding capital stock of one share of preferred stock for each ten shares
of Class P common stock and common stock (the "Preferred Stock Dividend"). In
December 1995, the Company paid a cash dividend on its then outstanding Class P
common stock equal to approximately $6.11 per share (after giving effect to the
recapitalization of the Company). Immediately thereafter, all outstanding
shares of Class P common stock were converted on a share-for-share basis into
shares of existing common stock. Prior to such conversion, the Class P common
stock was entitled to a preferential payment upon any distribution by the
Company to its holders of capital stock (whether by dividend, liquidating
distribution or otherwise) equal to the original cost of such shares plus an
amount which accrued on a daily basis at a rate of 15.0% per annum on such cost
and the amount so accrued in prior quarters (the "Preference Amount"). The cash
dividend returned such Preference Amount to the holders of the Class P common
stock.

(1)  Effective July 5, 1994, the Company acquired the assets and assumed
     certain liabilities of SCM. The acquisition has been accounted for under
     the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results
     have been included with the Company's results since the date of
     acquisition.

(2)  Effective August 16, 1995, the Company acquired the inventory and certain
     equipment of the file folder and hanging file product lines of the
     Globe-Weis office products division of Atapco. The acquisition has been
     accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
     the operating results have been included in the Company's results since
     the date of acquisition.

(3)  Effective October 31, 1995, the Company acquired Williamhouse. The
     acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method and,
     accordingly, the operating results of Williamhouse, except for the Regency
     Division, have been included in the Company's results since the date of
     acquisition. The Regency Division was identified as a non-strategic asset
     at the date of the acquisition of Williamhouse and was reflected as an
     asset held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet through June 27,
     1996, when it was sold. As such, the operating results of the Regency
     Division are excluded from the results of operations from the date of the
     Williamhouse acquisition.

(4)  Effective June 28, 1996, the Company acquired Niagara. The acquisition has
     been accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly, the
     operating results of Niagara for the six-month period ended December 31,
     1996 have been included in the Company's results for the year ended
     December 31, 1996.

(5)  Inventory cost is determined using the LIFO method of valuation. Gross
     profit in the fourth quarter of 1994 was adversely impacted by a
     significant increase in paper prices resulting in a $5.4 million charge
     for LIFO in advance of the Company's raising selling prices in the first
     quarter of 1995. Beginning in January 1995, the Company adopted new
     pricing policies enabling it to set product prices consistent with the
     Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. The Company believes that
     it is now able to price its products so as to minimize the impact of price
     volatility on dollar margins.

(6)  Includes non-cash stock option compensation charges of $24.3 million
     directly related to the Williamhouse acquisition as well as other
     non-recurring cash and non-cash charges aggregating $3.3 million.

(7)  Pro forma earnings (loss) per share and pro forma weighted average number
     of shares and share equivalents outstanding have been adjusted to give
     effect to the recapitalization of the Company which occurred concurrent
     with its initial public offering of common stock and to give effect to the
     issuance of 12.5 million shares of common stock in the initial public
     offering. Common stock equivalents have been determined using the treasury
     stock method.

(8)  For 1995, includes $4.5 million to pay the liquidation preference,
     including the return of original cost, of the Company's Class P common
     stock and $70.6 million to redeem a portion of its preferred stock.

ITEM 7   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

         The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
nationally branded and private label paper-based office products (excluding
copy paper) in the $60 billion to $70 billion North American office products
industry. The Company offers a broad assortment of products including writing
pads, file folders, envelopes, machine papers and other paper-based products.
Through its Ampad division, the Company is among the largest and most important
suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing products, filing supplies,
machine papers and retail envelopes to many of the largest and fastest growing
office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division, the Company is
the leading supplier of mill branded, specialty and commodity business
envelopes to paper merchants and distributors. The Company believes that its
future operating results will not be directly comparable to its historical
operating results because of its strategic acquisitions and the expected cost
savings from integration of its acquisitions. The Company's business has not
generally been seasonal in nature. Certain factors which have affected, and may
affect prospectively, the operating results of the Company are discussed below.

         Strategic Acquisitions. On October 31, 1995, the Company acquired
Williamhouse, a leading supplier of envelopes to many of the largest and
fastest growing distributors, for an aggregate purchase price (including
assumption of debt) of approximately $300 million plus reimbursement of certain
expenses to the sellers. On June 28, 1996, the Company acquired Niagara, a
national supplier of envelopes to fast growing distributors, for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $53.2 million, including costs of the
acquisition and a $5 million one year consulting agreement with Niagara's
former president. With these acquisitions, the Company became the largest
supplier of envelopes to the national paper merchants. The Williamhouse
acquisition was financed through the Company's old bank credit agreement and
the assumption of senior subordinated notes. The Niagara acquisition was
financed with proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division of Williamhouse.

         On July 5, 1994, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of SCM, one of the industry leaders in hanging files and writing
products. The aggregate acquisition consideration of $14.4 million, including
fees and expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt. On August
16, 1995, the Company acquired the file folder and hanging file product lines
of Atapco's Globe-Weis office products division. Atapco was one of the leading
providers of file folders and hanging files to office products superstores. The
aggregate acquisition consideration of $19.9 million, including fees and
expenses, was financed through the incurrence of bank debt and seller notes.
The SCM acquisition and the Globe-Weis acquisition further strengthened the
Company's position in the filing supplies and writing products categories.

         On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied, a national
supplier of machine papers, principally continuous computer forms. The purchase
price of $49.5 million was financed with borrowings under the Company's new
bank credit agreement. The Company expects that Shade/Allied's products will be
distributed by both the Ampad and Williamhouse divisions and that the
manufacturing plants will be integrated into the Ampad division. This
acquisition provided the Company with a more significant position in a fourth
product category.

         Purchase Accounting Effects. The Company's acquisitions have been
accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The acquisitions have
currently affected, and will prospectively affect, the Company's results of
operations in certain significant respects. The aggregate acquisition costs
(including assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets acquired based
on the fair market value of such net assets. The allocations of the purchase
price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain





                                      30
<PAGE>   19

assets such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including
goodwill, which results in incremental annual depreciation and amortization
expense each year.

         Potential Operating Improvements. The Company has identified and is in
the process of implementing cost reductions in connection with the
acquisitions. In addition, management plans to implement further identified
cost reductions which are expected to improve operations beyond 1996. The most
significant cost reduction actions involve closing Williamhouse's New York City
and Niagara's Buffalo headquarters, contractual changes in employee benefit and
other insurance plans and the consolidation of sales and marketing and other
administrative functions to eliminate duplicative functions, sales programs and
sales personnel, and the consolidation and integration of manufacturing and
distribution facilities. These improvements were being implemented during 1996
and, except for the integration of certain manufacturing and distribution
facilities, were completed by the end of 1996. However, because Williamhouse's
and Niagara's selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were
historically higher than the SG&A expenses of the Company. SG&A expenses as a
percentage of net sales in 1996 were higher than the SG&A expenses to net sales
percentage relationship in 1995 and 1994.

         Sale of Regency Division. The Company's management identified the
Regency Division of Williamhouse as a nonstrategic asset following the
acquisition of Williamhouse and, on June 27, 1996, sold the Regency Division
for approximately $47.9 million in net proceeds. As a result, the financial
statements of the Company included elsewhere herein reflect the Regency
Division as "Assets Held for Sale" as of December 31, 1995. The Company used
the net proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division to fund substantially
all of the Niagara acquisition.

         Paper Prices. Paper represents a majority of the Company's cost of
goods sold. While paper prices have increased by an average of less than 1%
annually since 1989, certain commodity grades have shown considerable price
volatility during that period. This volatility negatively impacted the
Company's earnings in 1994, particularly in the fourth quarter, as a result of
the Company's inability to implement price changes in many of its product lines
without giving its customers advance notification. Beginning in January 1995,
the Company adopted new pricing policies enabling it to set product prices
consistent with the Company's cost of paper at the time of shipment. The
Company believes that it is now able to price its products so as to minimize
the impact of price volatility on dollar margins.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The following table summarizes the Company's historical results of
operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 1994,
1995, and 1996. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994
reflect the historical results of the Company and the results of SCM for the
period from July 5, 1994 through December 31, 1994. The results of operations
for the year ended December 31, 1995 reflect the historical results of the
Company, the results of Globe-Weis from August 18, 1995 through December 31,
1995 and the results of Williamhouse for the two-month period ended December
31, 1995. The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996
include the results of operations of Niagara from June 28, 1996 through
December 31, 1996.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995

         Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $326.7
million, or 127.0%, to $583.9 million from $257.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1995. Of this net sales increase, $274.8 million is related to the
acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara and $35.2 million is related to the
acquisition of Globe-Weis. Ampad division net sales increased by $16.7 million
during 1996 compared to 1995 due to higher sales to the fast growing customer
channels such as superstores, mass merchant stores and contract stationers.

         Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by $77.9
million, or 164.0%, to $125.4 million from $47.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 1995. Approximately $69.5 million of the increase in gross profit
is attributable to the acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara. Gross profit
margin increased to 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 1996 from 18.5% for
the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in gross profit margin is
primarily attributable to higher margins of the Williamhouse division.

         SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased $29.6
million, or 164.4%, to $47.6 million from $18.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1995. Approximately $20.2 million is attributable to the
acquisition of Williamhouse and Niagara and $3.6 million to amortization of
goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisitions. The remainder of the
increase is due primarily to costs associated with the support of a
significantly larger corporation.

         Management fees and services increased $3.3 million in 1996 due to the
amortization of a consulting agreement with a former shareholder of Niagara and
an increase in Bain Capital's management fees.

         Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 increased $29.3
million to $43.0 million from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31,
1995. The increase is attributable primarily to higher levels of outstanding
debt for a full year as a result of the acquisition of Williamhouse and
Globe-Weis. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a
reduction of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense following the
redemption of $70 million of the Notes in August 1996.

         The income tax provision for year ended December 31, 1996 reflects an
effective tax rate of 43.2% versus an effective tax benefit rate of 56.5% for
the year ended December 31, 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 reflects a
40% combined statutory federal and state income tax rate adjusted for
nondeductible expenses, primarily goodwill amortization. The effective tax rate
for the year ended December 31, 1995 differs from the federal statutory income
tax rate of 35% due to state income taxes and the reversal of a valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets relating to the realizability of the Company's
net operating loss carryforward.

         Extraordinary item represents an after tax loss on extinguishment of
debt of $20.0 million ($33.0 million pretax) recognized as a result of the
redemption of $70.0 million of senior subordinated





                                      32
<PAGE>   21

notes with a portion of the net proceeds from the initial public offering and
the write off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related
to the Notes and all of the deferred financing costs associated with the old
bank credit agreement and the old accounts receivable facility.


YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

         Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $129.5
million, or 101.4%, to $257.2 million from $127.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. Of this net sales increase, $45.8 million, or 35.4%, is
related to the Williamhouse acquisition and $29.1 million, or 22.4%, is related
to the Globe-Weis acquisition. The remaining increase of $54.6 million, or
42.2%, is related to increased net sales in the base business, primarily as a
result of price increases and, to a lesser extent, a change in product mix,
partially offset by a decline in sales through non-strategic channels,
particularly independent dealers. Net sales to independent dealers declined to
less than 3.0% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 1995, compared to
8.6% in 1994.

         Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $40.5
million, or 579%, to $47.5 million, from $7.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase in gross profit
is attributable to the Williamhouse acquisition and an estimated $3.8 million
increase is due to the Globe-Weis acquisition. The remainder of the increase in
gross profit is due to (i) higher variable margins associated with the gains in
unit sales, product mix and pricing; (ii) lower fixed manufacturing costs
primarily as a result of the SCM plant closure; (iii) the Company's ability to
pass along paper price increases to its customers beginning in 1995, and (iv)
lower LIFO charges of approximately $2.5 million in 1995. Fixed manufacturing
costs as a percentage of net sales declined as a result of the successful
integration of the Globe-Weis manufacturing operations and the closing of the
Indiana facility.

         Gross profit margin increased in the year ended December 31, 1995 to
18.5% from 5.5% in 1994. The increase is principally a result of higher
variable margins, lower fixed manufacturing costs and lower LIFO charges.
Excluding acquisitions, gross profit margin would have increased to 16.4% for
the period ended December 31, 1995.

         SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased by $8.0
million, 80.0%, to $18.0 million, from $10.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. Approximately $5.9 million of this increase related to the
acquisitions. The balance of such increase related to higher amortization costs
as a result of the acquisitions and the costs associated with the accounts
receivable facility.

         The non-recurring compensation charge of $27.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1995 was primarily the result of the issuance of options for
preferred stock granted to existing option holders in order to maintain such
holders' economic value in previously issued options for Common Stock as a
result of the preferred stock dividend and the grant of additional options in
December 1995 at an exercise price below the fair market value at the date of
grant.

         Income (loss) from operations for the year ended December 31, 1995
increased by $4.9 million to $1.3 million from ($3.6) million in 1994, for the
reasons stated above. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net
sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased to 0.6% from (2.8)% for
the year ended December 31, 1994.

         Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1995 increased $9.1
million, or 198%, to $13.7 million from $4.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. The increase is attributable primarily to increased
borrowings as a result of the Williamhouse and the Globe-Weis acquisitions.





                                      33
<PAGE>   22

         Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 1995 reflects an
effective tax rate of 56.5%, versus a 6.1% effective tax rate in 1994. The
difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate in 1995 is due to
a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from improved
operating results.

         Extraordinary item represents an after tax loss on extinguishment of
debt of $9.7 million ($16.2 million pretax) recognized as a result of $10.8
million of redemption premiums and prepayment penalties associated with the
repurchase of the old debentures and the Company's bank debt and the write off
of $5.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the
redemption of the old debentures and the Company's debt refinancings.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
1996 was $23.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of
$4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increase in cash
provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net sales and
earnings of the Company in 1996. The net cash provided for the year ended
December 31, 1995 resulted primarily from an increase of $5.0 million in
accounts payable, an increase in accrued expenses of $4.9 million, a decrease
in inventories and increased margins on sales. Cash used by operations for the
years ended December 31, 1994 was $1.9 million. The use of cash for the year
ended December 31, 1994 was primarily due to an increase in inventories offset
by an increased LIFO charge due to rising paper prices, and a decrease in
accrued expenses, offset by an increase in accounts payable.

         Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996
and 1995 was $16.2 million and $131.3 million, respectively. The use of cash
for the year ended December 31, 1996 was principally due to the Niagara
acquisition ($53.0 million, net of cash received) and purchases of equipment
($14.6 million), offset by proceeds from the sale of the Regency Division and
other assets held for sale ($49.3 million). The use of cash for the year ended
December 31, 1995, was due to the Williamhouse acquisition ($122.7 million),
the Globe-Weis acquisition ($7.0 million) and purchase of equipment ($3.9
million). The use of cash for the year ended December 31, 1994, was due
primarily to the SCM acquisition ($13.7 million).

         Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1996
was $23.0 million as compared to a cash provision from financing activities of
$144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. During the year ended
December 31, 1996, the Company (i) completed its initial public offering of
12.5 million shares of common stock for $172.8 million in net proceeds after
deducting offering fees and expenses, (ii) refinanced its accounts receivable
facility with a new $60.0 million facility, (iii) refinanced its bank credit
agreement, (iv) redeemed $70.0 million of senior subordinated notes, (v) repaid
$95.8 million of debt incurred under the old bank credit agreement, (vi) paid
$7.7 million in redemption premiums on the Notes, (vii) repaid $10 million
under the new accounts receivable facility with proceeds from the sale of the
Regency Division, (viii) borrowed $54 million under the new accounts receivable
facility and (ix) repaid WR seller notes for $25 million. Cash provided by
financing activities for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $144.9
million and $16.5 million, respectively, primarily due to periodic financings
incurred in connection with the various acquisitions.

         Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $14.6 million, $3.9 million and $0.9
million, respectively. The Company expects that combined capital expenditure
requirements will be approximately $18 million for 1997. The Company believes
these capital expenditure levels will be sufficient to maintain competitiveness
and to provide sufficient manufacturing capacity. The Company expects to fund
capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operating activities.





                                      34
<PAGE>   23

         Contemporaneously with the initial public offering, the Company
refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the old bank credit
agreement with the proceeds of the loans under the new bank credit agreement.
As a result of the refinancing, effective July 8, 1996, the Company borrowed
$162.0 million in revolving loans and $6.5 million in swingline loans. The
proceeds of these loans were used to (i) pay off the remaining $145.0 million
in term loans, $5.0 million in revolver loans and $7.7 million in swingline
loans outstanding under the old bank credit agreement and (ii) pay
approximately $8.1 million in fees associated with the new bank credit
agreement. The new bank credit agreement provides a revolving credit facility
of $300 million . As of December 31, 1996, the Company had $155 million
available for borrowing under its bank credit agreement. Loans made under the
new bank credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the
Company's option, (i) a base rate plus an applicable margin or (ii) the LIBOR
rate plus an applicable margin (as each term is defined in the new bank credit
agreement). The applicable margin varies from 0% to 1.75%, based on the
Company's level of debt as compared to earnings ("leverage ratio"). The
Company's margin is currently 1.50%.

         Availability under the new bank credit agreement is subject to an
unused commitment fee which, like the applicable margin, varies from 0.3% to
0.5% based on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company's current rate is 0.5%.
Availability under the new bank credit agreement will be reduced to the extent
of the net proceeds of a sale of assets by the Company, the net proceeds of an
issuance of debt by the Company or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance of
equity by the Company. Availability will also be reduced by $50 million in 1999
and $50 million in 2000. The new bank credit agreement will terminate in 2001.
The Company will be permitted to make acquisitions under the new bank credit
agreement up to an aggregate of $25 million without consent of the agent bank
and up to $50 million if, on a pro forma basis giving effect to such
acquisition, the Company's leverage ratio is less than 3.0:1.0. As a result of
the new bank credit agreement, the Company's effective interest rate under its
senior credit facility was reduced by 189 basis points contemporaneously with
the initial public offering. The bank credit agreement and the indenture impose
certain restrictions on the Company, including restrictions on its ability to
incur indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments, grant liens, sell its
assets and engage in certain other activities. In addition, the indebtedness of
the Company under the bank credit agreement is secured by substantially all of
the assets of the Company, including the Company's real and personal property,
inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual property and other intangibles.

         On May 29, 1996, the Company refinanced its $45 million accounts
receivable facility with a new $60 million accounts receivable facility. Under
the new facility the Company may sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided
interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable. At December 31,
1996, $54 million of accounts receivable were sold under the program. The
agreement expires in 2000.

         On February 11, 1997, the Company acquired Shade/Allied for
approximately $49.5 million, including acquisition costs, using proceeds from
borrowings under its bank credit agreement.

         Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
anticipated internal growth, cash flow from operations, together with other
available sources of funds including borrowings under the new bank credit
agreement and available cash on hand at December 31, 1996, will be adequate for
the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and interest on
the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and
working capital requirements and to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to
comply with the terms of their debt agreements. However, actual capital
requirements may change, particularly as a result of any acquisitions which the
Company may make. The ability of the Company to meet its debt service
obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent, however, upon the
future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be
subject to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other
factors, including factors beyond the Company's control. A portion of the
consolidated debt of the Company bears interest at floating rates; therefore,
its financial condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in
prevailing interest rates.




                                      35
<PAGE>   24

The Company has entered into an interest rate protection agreement to minimize
the impact from a rise in interest rates.

INFLATION

         The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on 
its results of operations for the three years ended December 31,
1996.

             RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTS

         Company management is responsible for the preparation, accuracy and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements and other financial
information included in this Annual Report. This responsibility includes
preparing the statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and necessarily includes estimates that are based on management's
best judgments.

         To help ensure the accuracy and integrity of Company financial data,
management maintains internal controls which are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are executed as authorized, that they are
accurately recorded and that assets are properly safeguarded. These controls
are monitored by internal financial and operations management. It is essential
for all Company employees to conduct their business affairs in keeping with the
highest ethical standards as outlined in our code of conduct policy. Careful
selection of employees, and appropriate divisions of responsibility, also help
us to achieve our control objectives.

         The financial statements have been audited by the Company's
independent accountants, Price Waterhouse LLP. Their report is also shown on
this page.

         The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed
entirely of outside directors, oversees the adequacy of the Company's control
environment. The Audit Committee meets periodically with representatives of
Price Waterhouse LLP and internal financial management to review accounting,
control, auditing and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors
also have full and free access to meet privately with the Audit Committee.

                                 ---------------


                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
American Pad & Paper Company

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a) on page 38 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of American Pad & Paper Company and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

1.  ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS

     Organization and Basis of Presentation

         American Pad & Paper Company (formerly Ampad Holding Corporation and
referred to hereafter as the "Company") was incorporated on June 2, 1992 as a
holding company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Ampad Corporation
("Ampad"), the surviving entity from the merger between Ampad Acquisition
Corporation and Ampad. The Company had no operations through July 31, 1992.

         On October 3, 1995, the Company agreed to acquire in a merger
transaction all of the outstanding stock of WR Acquisition, Inc. ("WR"). In a
series of transactions, the Company exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly
owned subsidiary, Ampad, for newly issued shares of WR. WR then contributed
Ampad to its wholly owned subsidiary, Williamhouse-Regency of Delaware, Inc.,
renamed American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc. (referred to hereafter
on a pre-October 31, 1995 basis as "Williamhouse-Regency" and on a post-October
31, 1995 basis as "AP&P Delaware") in exchange for a right to receive $140
million of merger consideration. The Company, principally using bank borrowings
by AP&P Delaware aggregating $245 million, funded WR's right to receive the
merger consideration and WR in turn repurchased 100% of the WR shares not owned
by the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of the stock of
WR by the Company. As a result of the transactions, the Company now owns 100%
of WR which in turn owns 100% of AP&P Delaware.

         The financial statements of the Company include the historical
accounts and operations of the Company and AP&P Delaware. Included in the
historical accounts and operations of AP&P Delaware are the accounts and
operations of Ampad and of the envelope operations of Williamhouse and Niagara
since their respective dates of acquisition. Additionally, the consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Notepad Funding Corporation
("Notepad"), a special purpose corporation utilized in the accounts receivable
facility. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.

     American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.

         The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, AP&P Delaware, is the issuer of
13% Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). Terms of the Notes require, among
other matters, that AP&P Delaware provide annual audited and quarterly
unaudited financial statements to the holders of the publicly traded notes. The
Company is providing the holders of the Notes with its quarterly and annual
consolidated financial statements as well as its periodic reports as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that the financial
information and debt compliance reporting needs of the holders of the Notes are
satisfied by providing such consolidated financial statements.

         There are no material differences between the financial statements of
the Company and of AP&P Delaware. The composition of the AP&P Delaware's
stockholder's equity at December 31, 1996 consists of 100 shares of common
stock, paid in capital of $201,799 and an accumulated deficit of $97,200 and,
in total, is equal to the stockholders' equity of the Company.

        Business

         The Company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
paper-based office products in North America. The Company operates in one
business segment, converting paper into office products and offers a broad
assortment of products through two complementary divisions: Ampad (writing
pads, file folders, retail envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based
office products) and Williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). The
Company's products are distributed through large mass merchant retailers,
office product superstores, warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office
products wholesalers, paper merchants, and independent dealers. Substantially
all sales are to customers within the United States.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Pro Forma Information

         The pro forma information included in these financial statements and
notes is unaudited.

     Quarterly Financial Information

         The quarterly financial information included in these financial
statements is unaudited and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's
financial position, its results of operations and its cash flows. Operating
results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results
for the full fiscal year.


2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:

     Use of Estimates

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

         The Company considers all highly-liquid, interest-bearing instruments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     Revenue Recognition

         The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. All risks
and rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. Damaged or
defective products may be returned to the Company for replacement or credit.
The Company also offers sales volume rebates to customers based on their level
of sales activity. The effects of returns and discounts are estimated and
recorded at the time of shipment. Volume rebates are estimated and recorded
based on sales activity.

     Concentration of Credit Risk

         The Company sells its products into various wholesale and retail
channels, primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. Management
believes its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and
business risks. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and does not require collateral. Historically, the Company has not
experienced significant losses related to individual customers or groups of
customers in any particular industry or geographic area. An allowance is
maintained at a level which management believes is sufficient to cover
potential credit losses including potential losses on receivables sold.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Inventories

         Inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper
products, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Costs include material, labor and overhead.

     Property and Equipment

         Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
individual assets. Significant repairs or betterments which extend the useful
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining
useful life.

     Goodwill and Intangible Assets

         Goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets
of companies acquired in purchase transactions. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. Intangible
assets represent trade names acquired in the WR acquisition and are amortized
using the straight-line method. Trade names in the aggregate gross amount of
$31,700 and $6,200 are amortized over 40 years and 15 years, respectively. The
Company periodically reviews goodwill and other intangible assets to assess
recoverability. Potential impairment is measured based on the expected
undiscounted pre-tax and pre-interest cash flows of the operations giving rise
to the goodwill and other intangible assets compared to the carrying cost of
the related assets including goodwill and other intangible assets. Based upon
its most recent analysis, the Company believes that no impairment of goodwill
or intangible assets exists at December 31, 1996. Amortization expense was $114
in 1994, $879 in 1995 and $4,488 in 1996.

     Debt Issuance Costs

         Costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.

     Income Taxes

         The Company accounts for income taxes following the liability method,
which prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns. Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance,
for deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. The Company periodically reviews the realizability
of its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.

     Derivatives

         Premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as
interest expense over the term of the agreement. Amounts receivable under
interest rate cap agreements are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         Carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of
these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of senior bank debt bearing
interest at floating rates approximates fair value. The carrying value at
December 31, 1996 of the Notes of $130,000 compares to the Notes' fair value of
$153,400 based on quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1996.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Pro Forma Earnings Per Share

         Given the changes in the Company's capital structure effected in
connection with the initial public offering of the Company's common stock,
historical earnings per common share amounts are not presented in the
consolidated financial statements as they are not considered to be meaningful.
Pro forma weighted average shares outstanding reflect conversion of the
preferred stock into common stock for the same periods outstanding as the
underlying common stock on which the preferred stock was issued and the initial
public offering of common stock.

         The pro forma weighted average shares outstanding gives effect to the
8.1192-for-one stock split and has been adjusted to reflect as outstanding,
using the treasury stock method at the estimated initial public offering price,
all shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options granted subsequent to
April 25, 1995 (one year prior to the initial public offering filing date
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules).

     Reclassifications

         Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1995 consolidated financial
statements, none of which have an effect on net income (loss), have been
reclassified to conform with the presentation in the 1996 consolidated
financial statements.

3.  ACQUISITIONS

     WR Acquisition, Inc./Williamhouse-Regency

         The Company acquired WR Acquisition, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiary Williamhouse-Regency of Delaware, Inc. through a merger transaction
effective October 31, 1995. The transaction was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was
allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair market value of such net
assets. The aggregate acquisition cost totaled $147,853 and consisted of cash
of $140,000 and direct acquisition costs of $7,853. The acquisition was
entirely financed through the Company's bank credit agreement and an
off-balance sheet accounts receivable facility. The aggregate acquisition costs
have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:
accounts receivable of $39,174; inventories of $49,496; prepaid expenses and
other assets of $8,699; net assets held for sale of $39,252; property and
equipment of $86,063; identifiable intangible assets of $37,900; deferred
income tax liability of $24,340; accounts payable of $17,518; accrued expenses
of $40,518; noncurrent liabilities of $2,019 and assumed debt of $152,905. The
aggregate acquisition costs exceeded fair market value of the net assets
acquired by $124,569. Accordingly, goodwill was recorded and is being amortized
over 40 years. The operating results of AP&P Delaware have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The businesses acquired included the Williamhouse division, a manufacturer of a
wide range of mill branded, specialty and commodity envelopes; and the Regency
division, which provides custom imprinting services.

         The Regency personalized stationery and invitations division (the
"Regency Division") acquired in the acquisition was identified by management at
the date of acquisition as a nonstrategic asset held for sale. The purchase
price allocated to the net assets acquired included the expected proceeds from
sale plus the net cash flows expected to be generated from the Regency division
from the date of acquisition through the expected date of sale (the holding
period), offset by interest expense incurred during the holding period on debt
incurred to finance the purchase of the Regency Division. On June 27, 1996, the
Regency Division was sold for net proceeds of $47,890. The net proceeds from
the sale exceeded the carrying amount of the asset held for sale at December
31, 1996 by $1,599. As such, the preliminary purchase price allocation was
adjusted resulting in a $959 addition to goodwill. During the six month period
ended June 30, 1996, the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------


Regency division had operating income of $2,369 and
interest carrying costs of $1,884, which have been excluded from the condensed
consolidated statement of operations and included as adjustments to the
carrying amount of the net assets held for sale through the date of sale.

     Niagara Envelope Company, Inc.

         Effective June 28, 1996, the Company acquired the stock of Niagara
Envelope Company, Inc. ("Niagara"). This acquisition was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost
was allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net
assets. The aggregate acquisition costs totaled $48,202 and consisted of cash
of $45,175 and direct acquisition costs of $3,027. Additionally, the Company
paid $5,000 at closing under a one-year consulting services agreement. The
Company principally financed the acquisition through proceeds from the sale of
the Regency division described above. The aggregate acquisition cost has been
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: cash of
$238, accounts receivable of $10,946, inventories of $11,878, prepaid and other
assets of $1,572, management services agreement of $5,000, property and
equipment of $26,824, deferred income tax liability of $2,227, accounts payable
of $6,064, accrued expenses of $10,464, other noncurrent liabilities of $381
and assumed debt of $3,900. The aggregate acquisition costs exceeded fair
market value of the net assets acquired by $19,780. Accordingly, goodwill was
recorded and is being amortized over 40 years. The operating results of this
acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition. In 1996, the Company recorded $2,500
as management fees and services for the amortization of the consulting services
agreement.

     Certain costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the Company's
separate strategic plans to integrate and consolidate certain plant,
administrative and sales functions of Williamhouse and Niagara the closure of
Williamhouse's and Niagara's corporate headquarters and the associated net
reduction of approximately 250 employees. Such costs, aggregating $23,500,
include lease termination expenses, severance and contractual change of control
benefits, the liabilities for which were included in the purchase price
allocation within accrued expenses. Substantially all such actions are expected
to be completed prior to June 30, 1997, except for the consolidation of certain
plants which is not expected to be completed until December 31, 1998.

     Globe-Weis

         Effective August 16, 1995, the Company acquired the inventories and
certain equipment of the file folder and hanging file folder product lines of
Globe-Weis's ("Globe") office products division from Globe's parent. For
financial reporting purposes, this acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was
allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net
assets. The aggregate acquisition costs totaled $19,958 and consisted of cash
and seller issued notes of $17,869 and direct acquisition and financing costs
of $2,089. The Company principally financed the acquisition through its
financing arrangement with a commercial lender and notes issued to the seller.
The allocation of the aggregate acquisition costs was as follows: inventories
of $11,546, equipment of $6,747, and debt issuance costs of $1,665. The

goodwill was recorded and is being amortized over 20 years. The operating
results of this acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition.

     Pro Forma Results of Operations

         The following summary presents the results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1995 and 1996 on a pro forma basis, as if the Niagara, WR
and Globe acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 1995 (with appropriate
adjustments for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense,
elimination of duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related
income tax effects). The pro forma operating results are for illustrative
purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results which
would have occurred had the transaction been consummated as of those earlier
dates, nor are they indicative of results of operations which may occur in the
future.

     Shade/Allied, Inc.

         Effective February 11, 1997, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of Shade/Allied, Inc., ("Shade/Allied")
for approximately $49,500 in cash financed by the Company's bank credit
agreement. This acquisition will be recorded following the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets
and liabilities at their fair market values. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of the net assets acquired will be allocated to
goodwill and amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. The Company
preliminarily expects that the purchase price will be allocated as follows:
trade accounts receivable of $4,584, inventories of $5,941,

</TABLE>

The Company originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a revolving pool
of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in October 1995. On May 24, 1996, the
Company entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with similar
terms. At December 31, 1996, $54,000 of accounts receivable were sold under
this facility. The accompanying balance sheets exclude the sold accounts
receivable. The full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been
retained because the Company has retained substantially the same risk of credit
loss as if the receivables had not been sold through the recourse provision of
the receivable sale agreement. Under the agreement, the maximum amount of the
purchaser's investment is subject to change based on the level of eligible
receivables and restrictions on concentrations of receivables.

         The total cost of the program was $423 in 1995 and $1,823 in 1996 and
is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of operations. The agreement expires in 2000.

         Bad debt expense for 1994, 1995 and 1996 was immaterial.

</TABLE>

         In connection with the WR and Niagara acquisitions, total inventories
for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,825 to fair market
value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical LIFO reserves. Since
the Company is on the LIFO method of accounting, such write-up formed the
historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.
There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories in 1994. liquidation of LIFO
layers in 1995 and 1996 was not material.

         Future  maturities  of long-term  debt at December 31, 1996 are $1,561

     Senior Bank Debt

         Contemporaneously with the Company's initial public offering of common
stock, the Company refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the
old bank credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. The new
bank credit agreement is a revolving credit facility with a maximum
availability of $300,000 with the following principal terms: Loans are made
directly to AP&P Delaware

- --------------------------------------------------------------------


and are guaranteed by the Company and each of its subsidiaries, other than
Notepad. Loans made under the new bank credit agreement bear interest at a rate
per annum, equal to, at the Company's option, the base rate, plus an applicable
margin, or a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, as such terms are
defined in the agreement. The applicable margin for base rate loans varies from
0% to .75% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar rate loans varies from .75%
to 1.75%, each based on the Company's leverage ratio and the type of loan.
Availability under the new bank credit agreement is subject to an unused
commitment fee which is a percentage of the unutilized revolving loan
commitment. The percentage varies from .3% to .5% based on the Company's
leverage ratio.

         Availability under the new bank credit agreement is reduced to the
extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by the Company, the net proceeds
of an issuance of debt by the Company or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance
of equity by the Company. Availability will be reduced by $50,000 in 1999 and
$50,000 in 2000. The new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001. The Company
is permitted to make acquisitions under the new bank credit agreement up to
$25,000 per acquisition without the consent of the participating banks and up
to $50,000 per acquisition if, on a pro forma basis giving effect to such
acquisition, the Company's leverage ratio is less than 3.0 to 1.0.

         The new bank credit agreement requires the Company to meet certain
financial tests, including minimum levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in the
agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. The agreement
also contains covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales,
acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. The new bank credit agreement contains customary events of default,
including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant
defaults, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of
bankruptcy and insolvency, ERISA, judgment defaults, failure of any guaranty or
security agreement supporting the bank credit agreement to be in full force and
effect, and change of control.

         The new bank credit agreement requires the Company to continue its
interest rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the
agreement. In January 1996, the Company entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles the Company to receive from the counterparty on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which LIBOR exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. The counterparty to this agreement is a large financial institution.

         The new bank credit agreement is guaranteed by the Company and all its
subsidiaries, except for Notepad, and is secured by substantially all assets of
AP&P Delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of AP&P Delaware and its
subsidiaries.

     Senior Subordinated Notes

         AP&P Delaware issued $200,000 of 13% Senior Subordinated Notes
("Notes") through a private placement in December 1995. In June 1996, AP&P
Delaware completed an exchange of the privately-held notes for publicly-held
notes with substantially identical terms. The Notes are unsecured and
subordinated to all senior bank debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May
15 and November 15. The Notes are redeemable on and after November 15, 2000, at
AP&P Delaware's option, at redemption prices ranging from 106.5% of the face
value of the notes in 2000 to 100% of the face value of the notes in 2003 or
thereafter. Additionally, at any time on or prior to November 15, 1998,
Delaware may, at its option, use the proceeds of public equity offerings of the
Company or AP&P Delaware to redeem up to 35% of the Notes at redemption prices
ranging from 111% to 113% of the face value of the Notes. Subsequent to the
Company's initial public offering of common stock in July 1996, AP&P Delaware
repaid $70,000 of the Notes.

<PAGE>   47

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------


         The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all subsidiaries
of AP&P Delaware, except for Notepad, on a joint and several and senior
subordinated basis, however, no guarantee from the Company exists. At December
31, 1996 there were no guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes contain restrictive
covenants which, among other things, limit dividends, repurchase of capital
stock and investments, incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with
affiliates and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.

         On December 1, 1995, $200,000 of proceeds were received from the Notes
were used to repurchase $100,000 of publicly-held notes of Williamhouse-Regency
assumed in the WR Acquisition and redeem preferred stock, preferred stock
equivalents, and Class P common stock in the aggregate amount of $75,000.

     Other

         WR seller notes in the amount of $25,157 outstanding at December 31,
1995, were repaid in January 1996 from the proceeds of the remaining borrowings
issuable under a term loan from the old bank credit agreement. The WR seller
notes bore interest at 1% and were classified as long term in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 1995 since such debt was refinanced with
long-term debt.

         At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding various industrial
revenue bonds in the aggregate amount of $10,140. The industrial revenue bonds
bear interest at rates ranging from 2.65% to 5.25%. Aggregate annual principal
payments ranging from $300 to $700 are due through 2010. Payment of principal
and interest on the industrial revenue bonds are guaranteed by the Company. The
industrial revenue bonds are secured by letters of credit.

         At December 31, 1995 and 1996, letters of credit in the aggregate
amount of $15,800 and $15,826, respectively, were outstanding.

         The Company incurred fees related to the financing transactions of
approximately $33,200 and $8,620 in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which have
been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest method over
the respective lives of the agreements.

         An extraordinary after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,995
($33,004 pre-tax) is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 1996 as a result of $7,700 of prepayment penalties
associated with the repayment of $70,000 of Notes and the write off of $25,304
of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with such Notes and with
the Company's old bank credit agreement. An extraordinary after-tax loss on
extinguishment of debt of $9,652 ($16,086 pretax) is reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995 as a
result of $10,812 of prepayment penalties associated with the repurchase of
Williamhouse-Regency's $100,000 of notes and Ampad's bank debt and the
write-off of $5,274 of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with
Williamhouse-Regency's notes redemption and Ampad's debt refinancings.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, STOCK OPTIONS AND NONRECURRING COMPENSATION CHARGE

         Effective July 2, 1996, the Company sold 12,500 shares of common stock
in an initial public offering. The net proceeds to the Company from the
offering, which were received on July 8, 1996, amounted to $172,801 after
deducting underwriting discounts, legal and accounting fees, registration and
travel expenses. The Company used proceeds from the initial public offering and
working capital to: (i) repay $95,800 on the indebtedness incurred under the
old bank credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the 13%
Notes from the holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in
redemption premium on such Notes.

         Prior to the completion of the initial public offering, the Company's
shareholders approved an 8.1192-for-one stock split for all of the then
outstanding common stock shares and common stock options. 



                                      59

- --------------------------------------------------------------------


Concurrently with the stock split, all of the outstanding preferred stock and
preferred stock options were converted into shares of common stock and common
stock options, respectively, using a conversion price determined by dividing
the preferred stock liquidation value of $1,948.50 per share by the initial
public offering price per share of $15. All common stock share amounts have
been restated to reflect the stock split.

         The preferred stock has no dividend rights and, except as required by
law, is nonvoting. As of December 31, 1995, after giving effect to satisfaction
of its preferred redemption values, the Company's Class P common stock was also
converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock.

         At January 1, 1995, options for 1,026 shares of common stock had been
issued to certain members of the Company's management under the 1992 Key
Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1992 Plan") in two separate tranches--"Core"
stock options for 758 shares and "Performance" stock options for 268 shares.
The exercise price of all options equaled or exceeded the fair market value at
date of grant. In connection with the WR acquisition effective October 31,
1995, the Company's equity was recapitalized via a stock dividend of one share
of preferred stock for every ten shares of common stock and Class P common
stock and options to purchase common stock. Concurrently, preferred stock
options were granted to holders of common stock options and the respective
exercise prices were adjusted to maintain option holders' pro rata economic
interests pursuant to antidilution provisions included in the existing stock
option plans.

         The issuance of the preferred stock options was considered additional
consideration to restore the option holders' economic position as a result of
the recapitalization, which was directly related to the WR acquisition. Receipt
of such consideration resulted in a nonrecurring, noncash compensation charge
equal to the excess of fair market value over the exercise price of the
preferred stock options of $24,265 with a corresponding credit being recorded
to additional paid-in capital. The adjustment to the underlying common stock
option's prices did not result in additional compensation expense in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

         Additionally, options for 66 shares of common stock and 105 shares of
preferred stock were granted to certain members of management in December 1995.
The exercise prices of $0.007 per common share and $.028 per preferred share
were below the fair market value of the respective classes of stock at date of
grant, resulting in a noncash compensation charge equal to the aggregate excess
of fair market value over the exercise price, or $1,733, with a corresponding
credit being recorded to additional paid-in capital.

         The Company awarded additional compensation to executives and
nonexecutives of $1,634 in 1995 in recognition of the significant transactions
consummated during the year. The Company does not expect this additional
compensation to be awarded in future years.

STOCK OPTIONS

         1992 Key Employees Stock Option Plan. On July 31, 1992, the Board of
Directors of the Company adopted the Ampad Holding Corporation 1992 Key
Employees Stock Option Plan, which authorizes grants of stock options and the
sale of common stock to current or future employees, directors, consultants or
advisers of the Company or its subsidiaries. During 1992, 1994 and 1995, the
Company granted options to purchase 2,839 shares of common stock to three of
its officers, who were also stockholders, at weighted average purchase prices
ranging from $.007 to $1.65 per share. Currently, all options granted pursuant
to the 1992 Stock Plan are exercisable and expire 15 months after the
termination of the option holder's employment with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. On June 22, 1996 the 1992 Stock Plan was terminated by the Board
of Directors.

         1996 Stock Plan. On June 22, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Key
Employees Stock Incentive Plan. The 1996 Stock Plan provides for the granting
to employees and other key individuals who perform services for the Company the
following types of incentive awards: options to purchase common stock, stock

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

appreciation rights with respect to the common stock, restricted shares of
common stock, performance grants and other types of awards that the
Compensation Committee deems to be consistent with the purposes of the 1996
Stock Plan. The 1996 Stock Plan affords the Company flexibility in tailoring
incentive compensation to support corporate and business objectives, and to
anticipate and respond to changing business environments and competitive
compensation practices.

         An aggregate of 1,500 shares of common stock of the Company have been
reserved for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan. Except for any other
adjustments made by the Board of Directors relating to a stock split or certain
other changes in the number of shares of common stock, or to reflect
extraordinary corporate transactions, further increases in the number of shares
authorized for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan must be approved by the
stockholders of the Company. Stock options granted during 1996 under the Stock
Plan generally have a maximum term of ten years and vest over four years. The
Company granted options to purchase 742 shares of common stock at a weighted
average purchase price of $15 per share.

         Non-Employee Director Plan. On June 22, 1996, the Company adopted the
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan. Pursuant to the Non-Employee Director
Plan, each director (other than directors who are employees of the Company)
will receive a one-time option grant to purchase 25 shares of common stock upon
effectiveness of the Non-Employee Director Plan or, for new directors, upon
initial election or appointment to the Board. In addition, each director will
receive an annual grant of options to purchase two thousand shares of common
stock beginning on the latter of the date of such director's fourth anniversary
of being elected to the Board or four years from the initial public offering
date. The initial one-time grants will vest over three years with 50% vesting
in the first year and 25% in the remaining two years. The annual grants will
vest in three equal installments. The exercise price for all options granted
under the Non-Employee Director plan will be at fair market value as of the
time of such grant. Options granted under the non-Employee Director plan will
generally terminate ten years after the date such options become exercisable.
An aggregate of 350 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the non-Employee Director Plan. During 1996, the Company granted options
to purchase 125 shares of common stock to the Company's non-employee directors
at a weighted average purchase price of $17.38 per share.

         Stock Purchase Plan. On June 22, 1996, the Company adopted the
Management Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"). The Purchase Plan is
designed to provide equity incentives to selected members of the Company's
management, including employee Directors and executive officers. The eligible
participants will be selected by the Compensation Committee upon the
recommendation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Under the Purchase
Plan, eligible participants will be able to elect to purchase shares of common
stock in lieu of up to 25% of their annual incentive bonuses. The common stock
will be sold under the Purchase Plan at a 25% discount from the fair market
value on the date of purchase. An aggregate of 250 shares of common stock have
been reserved and 36 shares were issued in February 1997.

         For the three years ended December 31, 1996, stock option activity is
as follows:

         The average life is the average contractual life of the outstanding
options in years.

         In 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure-only option under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, ("SFAS No. 123").

         On a pro forma basis, if the Company had recorded compensation expense
in 1996 for the stock options granted in accordance with the accounting
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the pro forma net income before extraordinary item
would have been $17,820 and the pro forma net income per share before
extraordinary item would have been $.60. There would have been no pro forma
effect in 1995 as the Company recorded a compensation charge based on the fair
value of the stock options granted.

         The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
stock options granted in 1996 include a risk free rate of return ranging from
6.5% to 6.75%, an expected option life of 10 years, an expected volatility of
27% and no expected dividend payments.

11. PENSION PLAN AND 401(K) PLAN

         The Company is a sponsor of two qualified defined benefit pension
plans and a supplemental non- qualified benefit pension plan which were assumed
as part of its acquisitions. The Company's liabilities under such plans are
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

         The Company maintains retirement plans (401(k) plan) for the benefit
of all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Company
contributions to the plans may be made at the discretion of the board of
directors. Contributions to the plans were approximately $557, $568, $1,239 for
the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

tax benefit rate of 35.0% differed from the Company's effective income tax
rate, including extraordinary item, of 89.8% due to the following reasons:
goodwill and intangible asset amortization accounted for 113.6%; other

(5.0)% and other items accounted for 4.4%. For the year ended December 31,
1995, the Company's statutory income tax benefit rate of 35.0% differed from
the Company's effective income tax benefit rate, including extraordinary item,
of 46.9% due to the following reasons: state income taxes accounted for (5.0)%;
release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance accounted for (6.4)% and
other items accounted for (0.5)%

in 1995 as a result of management's assessment of future realizability of
deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 1994, the effect on the
income tax provision related to the valuation allowance was a charge of $1,180.
No benefit was recognized in 1994 for operating losses carried forward.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------


         At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating losses available
to reduce future taxable income of approximately $19,319. These net operating
losses expire in the years 2007 through 2011. If certain substantial changes in
the Company's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on
the amount of the carryforwards which can be utilized. In addition, the Company
has approximately $1,363 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. The
acquisition of WR resulted in a change in control of WR. Consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Commitments

         The Company is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for
office space and machinery and equipment which expire at various times through
1997. Annual minimum lease commitments under these leases amount to $3,206 in
1997, $1,989 in 1998, $1,347 in 1999, $1,011 in 2000, $622 in 2001 and $1,386
thereafter for an aggregate of $9,561.

         Total rent expense was approximately $853, $1,888, $3,551 for 1994,
1995 and 1996 respectively.

     Litigation

         There are various outstanding claims against the Company arising in
the normal course of business. The Company believes that the claims are without
merit and that any losses which might ultimately be sustained by the Company
would not be material to the financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows of the Company.

     Environmental Matters

         The Company is subject to federal, state, and local environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for
management of waste. While there can be no assurance that the Company is at all
times in complete compliance with all such requirements, the Company has made
and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements.

         The Company had been named a potentially responsible party under the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, at five waste disposal sites. The Company settled its
liability at four of these sites as a de minimis party. The Company expects to
be eligible for a de minimis settlement at the remaining site.

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company
incurred $575, $542 and $1,380, respectively, for management and directors'
fees and out of pocket expenses to the principal shareholders (Bain Capital).
Unpaid fees of $500 are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated
balance sheets at December 31, 1996. There were no unpaid fees at December 31,
1995. In June 1996 the Company revised its management services agreement with
Bain Capital, pursuant to which, for four years, the Company will pay Bain
Capital an aggregate annual fee of no less than $2,250 plus a fee of 1% for
completed acquisition transactions.

         In 1996, the Company paid Bain Capital $3,000 in fees in connection
with the new bank credit agreement, which were included in debt issuance costs
paid, $550 and $750, respectively, in fees in connection with the acquisition
of Niagara and Shade/Allied, which were included as part of the purchase price,
and $2,091 in connection with the Company's initial public offering of common
stock. In 1995, the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------


Company paid $7,000 to Bain Capital for services relating to the WR acquisition
and the related financing of the transaction. Of this amount, $4,300 was
included in deferred financing fees and $2,700 was a direct acquisition expense
allocated to the net assets acquired. The Company also paid $450 to Bain
Capital relating to the Globe-Weis acquisition which was included in deferred
financing fees. The Company paid Bain Capital $225 for services related to the
SCM acquisition and the related financing of the transaction.

         At December 31, 1995, the Company had an outstanding note receivable
for $112 from its chairman which was repaid in June 1996. At December 31, 1996,
the Company had an outstanding note receivable of $324 from its executive vice
president which is due in 1998, of which $53 was repaid in February 1997.

14. OTHER INFORMATION

         Substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted within the
United States.

         Two customers accounted for 27% and one customer accounted for 11% of
the Company's total net sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 and 1996,
respectively.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of 
American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc.
 (a wholly owned subsidiary of American Pad & Paper Company)

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a) on page 38 present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

1.  ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS

     Organization and Basis of Presentation

         American Pad & Paper Company of Delaware, Inc. ("Delaware") is a
wholly owned subsidiary of American Pad & Paper Company ("AP&P") (formerly
Ampad Holding Corporation). AP&P was incorporated on June 2, 1992 as a holding
company to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Ampad Corporation ("Ampad"),
the surviving entity from the merger between Ampad Acquisition Corporation and
Ampad. AP&P had no operations through July 31, 1992.

         On October 3, 1995, AP&P agreed to acquire in a merger transaction all
of the outstanding stock of WR Acquisition, Inc. ("WR"). In a series of
transactions, AP&P exchanged 100% of the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary,
Ampad, for newly issued shares of WR. WR then contributed Ampad to its wholly
owned subsidiary, Williamhouse-Regency of Delaware, Inc., renamed American Pad
& Paper Company of Delaware, Inc. (referred to hereafter on a pre-October 31,
1995 basis as "Williamhouse-Regency" and on a post-October 31, 1995 basis as
"Delaware") in exchange for a right to receive $140 million of merger
consideration. AP&P, principally using bank borrowings by Delaware aggregating
$245 million, funded WR's right to receive the merger consideration and WR in
turn repurchased 100% of the WR shares not owned by AP&P. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase of the stock of WR by AP&P. As a result of the
transactions, AP&P now owns 100% of WR which in turn owns 100% of AP&P
Delaware.

         The financial statements of Delaware include the historical accounts
and operations of Delaware and the accounts and operations of Ampad and of the
envelope operations of Williamhouse and Niagara since their respective dates of
acquisition. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Notepad Funding Corporation ("Notepad"), a special purpose
corporation utilized in the accounts receivable facility. All significant
intercompany balances have been eliminated.

        American Pad & Paper Company

         AP&P is a holding company whose common stock is publicly traded on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AGP" with no operations other than
its investment in Delaware. Except for the preferred and common stock shares of
AP&P issued, authorized and outstanding, and the related capital contributions
by AP&P and dividends to AP&P, there are no material differences between the
financial statements of AP&P and Delaware. AP&P has followed full push-down
accounting in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements of
Delaware.

        Business

         Delaware is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of
paper-based office products in North America. Delaware operates in one business
segment, converting paper into office products and offers a broad assortment of
products through two complementary divisions: Ampad (writing pads, file
folders, retail envelopes, machine papers, and other paper-based office
products) and Williamhouse (business envelopes and machine papers). Delaware's
products are distributed through large mass merchant retailers, office product
superstores, warehouse clubs, major contract stationers, office products
wholesalers, paper merchants, and independent dealers. Substantially all sales
are to customers within the United States.

     Pro Forma Information

         The pro forma information included in these financial statements and
notes is unaudited.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:

     Use of Estimates

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

         Delaware considers all highly-liquid, interest-bearing instruments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     Revenue Recognition

         Delaware recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product. All risks
and rewards of ownership pass to the customer upon shipment. Damaged or
defective products may be returned to Delaware for replacement or credit.
Delaware also offers sales volume rebates to customers based on their level of
sales activity. The effects of returns and discounts are estimated and recorded
at the time of shipment. Volume rebates are estimated and recorded based on
sales activity.

     Concentration of Credit Risk

         Delaware sells its products into various wholesale and retail
channels, primarily for the commercial office products marketplace. Management
believes its credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and
business risks. Delaware performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers
and does not require collateral. Historically, Delaware has not experienced
significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in
any particular industry or geographic area. An allowance is maintained at a
level which management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses
including potential losses on receivables sold.

     Inventories

         Inventories, which consist primarily of paper and converted paper
products, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Costs include material, labor and overhead.

     Property and Equipment

         Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
individual assets. Significant repairs or betterments which extend the useful
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining
useful life.

     Goodwill and Intangible Assets

         Goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets
of companies acquired in purchase transactions. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years. Intangible
assets represent trade names acquired in the WR acquisition and are amortized
using

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


the straight-line method. Trade names in the aggregate gross amount of $31,700
and $6,200 are amortized over 40 years and 15 years, respectively. Delaware
periodically reviews goodwill and other intangible assets to assess
recoverability. Potential impairment is measured based on the expected
undiscounted pre-tax and pre-interest cash flows of the operations giving rise
to the goodwill and other intangible assets compared to the carrying cost of
the related assets including goodwill and other intangible assets. Based upon
its most recent analysis, Delaware believes that no impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets exists at December 31, 1996. Amortization expense was $114 in
1994, $879 in 1995 and $4,488 in 1996.

     Debt Issuance Costs

         Costs associated with debt issuances are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.

     Income Taxes

         Delaware accounts for income taxes as if it were a separately
reporting company for tax purposes. Delaware follows the liability method,
which prescribes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in Delaware's financial statements or tax
returns. Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance,
for deductible temporary differences and tax operating loss and credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred tax
asset or liability balances. Delaware periodically reviews the realizability of
its deferred tax assets and, as needed, records valuation allowances when
realizability of the deferred tax asset is not likely.

     Derivatives

         Premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are amortized as
interest expense over the term of the agreement. Amounts receivable under
interest rate cap agreements are recorded as a reduction of interest expense.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         Carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of
these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of senior bank debt bearing
interest at floating rates approximates fair value. The carrying value at
December 31, 1996 of the Notes of $130,000 compares to the Notes' fair value of
$153,400 based on quoted market rates, as determined at the end of 1996.

     Reclassifications

         Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1995 consolidated financial
statements, none of which have an effect on net income (loss), have been
reclassified to conform with the presentation in the 1996 consolidated
financial statements.

     Earnings per share

         Earnings per share are not presented because Delaware's common stock
is not publicly traded.

3.  ACQUISITIONS

     WR Acquisition, Inc./Williamhouse-Regency

         AP&P acquired WR Acquisition, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary
Williamhouse-Regency of Delaware, Inc. through a merger transaction effective
October 31, 1995. The transaction was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was allocated to the
net assets acquired based on the fair market value of such net assets. The
aggregate acquisition cost totaled $147,853 and consisted of cash of $140,000
and direct acquisition costs of $7,853. The acquisition was entirely financed
through the Company's bank credit agreement and an off-balance sheet accounts
receivable facility. The aggregate acquisition costs have been allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: accounts receivable of
$39,174; inventories of $49,496; prepaid expenses and other assets of $8,699;
net assets held for sale of $39,252; property and equipment of $86,063;
identifiable intangible assets of $37,900; deferred income tax liability of
$24,340; accounts payable of $17,518; accrued expenses of $40,518; noncurrent
liabilities of $2,019 and assumed debt of $152,905. The aggregate acquisition
costs exceeded fair market value of the net assets acquired by $124,569.
Accordingly, goodwill was recorded and is being amortized over 40 years. The
operating results of Delaware have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The businesses
acquired included the Williamhouse division, a manufacturer of a wide range of
mill branded, specialty and commodity envelopes; and the Regency division,
which provides custom imprinting services.

         The Regency personalized stationery and invitations division (the
"Regency Division") acquired in the acquisition was identified by management at
the date of acquisition as a nonstrategic asset held for sale. The purchase
price allocated to the net assets acquired included the expected proceeds from
sale plus the net cash flows expected to be generated from the Regency division
from the date of acquisition through the expected date of sale (the holding
period), offset by interest expense incurred during the holding period on debt
incurred to finance the purchase of the Regency Division. On June 27, 1996, the
Regency Division was sold for net proceeds of $47,890. The net proceeds from
the sale exceeded the carrying amount of the asset held for sale at December
31, 1996 by $1,599. As such, the preliminary purchase price allocation was
adjusted resulting in a $959 addition to goodwill. During the six month period
ended June 30, 1996, the Regency division had operating income of $2,369 and
interest carrying costs of $1,884, which have been excluded from the condensed
consolidated statement of operations and included as adjustments to the
carrying amount of the net assets held for sale through the date of sale.

     Niagara Envelope Company, Inc.

         Effective June 28, 1996, Delaware acquired the stock of Niagara
Envelope Company, Inc. ("Niagara"). This acquisition was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost
was allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net
assets. The aggregate acquisition costs totaled $48,202 and consisted of cash
of $45,175 and direct acquisition costs of $3,027. Additionally, Delaware paid
$5,000 at closing under a one-year consulting services agreement. Delaware
principally financed the acquisition through proceeds from the sale of the
Regency division described above. The aggregate acquisition cost has been
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: cash of
$238, accounts receivable of $10,946, inventories of $11,878, prepaid and other
assets of $1,572, management services agreement of $5,000, property and
equipment of $26,824, deferred income tax liability of $2,227, accounts payable
of $6,064, accrued expenses of $10,464, other noncurrent liabilities of $381
and assumed debt of $3,900. The aggregate acquisition costs exceeded fair
market value of the net assets acquired by $19,780. Accordingly, goodwill was
recorded and is being amortized over 40 years. The operating results of this
acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition. In 1996, Delaware recorded $2,500 as
management fees and services for the amortization of the consulting services
agreement.

         Certain costs are expected to be incurred in connection with
Delaware's separate strategic plans to integrate and consolidate certain plant,
administrative and sales functions of Williamhouse and Niagara the closure of
Williamhouse's and Niagara's corporate headquarters and the associated net
reduction of approximately 250 employees. Such costs, aggregating $23,500,
include lease termination expenses, severance and contractual change of control
benefits, the liabilities for which were included in the purchase price
allocation within accrued expenses. Substantially all such actions are expected
to be completed prior to June 30, 1997, except for the consolidation of certain
plants which is not expected to be completed until December 31, 1998.

     Globe-Weis

         Effective August 16, 1995, Delaware acquired the inventories and
certain equipment of the file folder and hanging file folder product lines of
Globe-Weis's ("Globe") office products division from Globe's parent. For
financial reporting purposes, this acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was
allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such net
assets. The aggregate acquisition costs totaled $19,958 and consisted of cash
and seller issued notes of $17,869 and direct acquisition and financing costs
of $2,089. Delaware principally financed the acquisition through its financing
arrangement with a commercial lender and notes issued to the seller. The
allocation of the aggregate acquisition costs was as follows: inventories of
$11,546, equipment of $6,747, and debt issuance costs of $1,665. The operating
results of this acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition.

     SCM Office Supplies

         Effective July 5, 1994, Delaware acquired the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of SCM Office Supplies, Inc. For financial reporting
purposes, this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the aggregate acquisition cost was allocated among the
net assets acquired based on the fair market value of such net assets. The
aggregate acquisition cost totaled $14,372 and consisted of cash of $12,880 and
direct acquisition and financing costs of $1,492. Delaware principally financed
the acquisition through its financing arrangement with a commercial lender. The
allocation of the aggregate acquisition cost to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was as follows: accounts receivable of $7,922, inventories
of $6,857, prepaid expenses and other assets of $16, debt issuance costs of
$628, property and equipment of $5,441, net deferred income tax assets of
$1,553, accounts payable of $4,235, and accrued liabilities of $6,333. The
aggregate acquisition cost exceeded fair market value of the net assets
acquired by approximately $2,523. Accordingly, goodwill was recorded and is
being amortized over 20 years. The operating results of this acquisition have
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the
date of acquisition.

     Pro Forma Results of Operations

         The following summary presents the results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1995 and 1996 on a pro forma basis, as if the Niagara, WR
and Globe acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 1995 (with appropriate
adjustments for amortization of intangible assets, interest expense,
elimination of duplicate selling and administrative expenses and the related
income tax effects). The pro forma operating results are for illustrative
purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results which
would have occurred had the transaction been consummated as of those earlier
dates, nor are they indicative of results of operations which may occur in the
future.

     Shade/Allied, Inc.

         Effective February 11, 1997, Delaware acquired all of the outstanding
common and preferred stock of Shade/Allied, Inc., ("Shade/Allied") for
approximately $49,500 in cash financed by Delaware's bank credit agreement.
This acquisition will be recorded following the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets and
liabilities at their fair market values. The excess of the purchase price over
the fair market value of the net assets acquired will be allocated to goodwill
and amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Delaware preliminarily
expects that the purchase price will be allocated as follows: trade accounts
receivable of $4,584, inventories of $5,941, other current assets of $929,
property, plant and equipment of $10,685, current liabilities of $13,877,
long-term liabilities of $3,323 and goodwill of $44,561.

         The following summary presents the results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 1996, on a pro forma unaudited basis, as if the Shade/Allied
and Niagara acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 1996 (with appropriate

</TABLE>

         Delaware originally sold an undivided ownership interest in a
revolving pool of trade accounts receivable for $45,000 in October 1995. On May
24, 1996, Delaware entered into a new $60,000 accounts receivable facility with
similar terms. At December 31, 1996, $54,000 of accounts receivable were sold
under this facility. The accompanying balance sheets exclude the sold accounts
receivable. The full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been
retained because Delaware has retained substantially the same risk of credit
loss as if the receivables had not been sold through the recourse provision of
the receivable sale agreement. Under the agreement, the maximum amount of the
purchaser's investment is subject to change based on the level of eligible
receivables and restrictions on concentrations of receivables.

         The total cost of the program was $423 in 1995 and $1,823 in 1996 and
is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of operations. The agreement expires in 2000.

         Bad debt expense for 1994, 1995 and 1996 was immaterial.


5. INVENTORIES

</TABLE>

         In connection with the WR and Niagara acquisitions, total inventories
for financial accounting purposes were written up by $15,825 to fair market
value including reversal of $7,339 related to historical LIFO reserves. Since
Delaware is on the LIFO method of accounting, such write-up formed the
historical base year cost for the acquired inventories and will not impact the
statement of operations unless a decrement of base inventory quantities occurs.
There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories in 1994. Liquidation of LIFO
layers in 1995 and 1996 was not material.

         Future maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1996 are $1,561 in

     Senior Bank Debt

         Contemporaneously with AP&P's initial public offering of common stock,
Delaware refinanced and retired all remaining indebtedness under the old bank
credit agreement and entered into a new bank credit agreement. The new bank
credit agreement is a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of
$300,000 with the following principal terms: Loans are made directly to
Delaware and are guaranteed by AP&P and each of its subsidiaries, other than
Notepad. Loans made under the new bank credit agreement bear interest at a rate
per annum, equal to, at Delaware's option, the base rate, plus an applicable
margin, or a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, as such terms are
defined in the agreement. The applicable margin for base rate loans varies from
0% to .75% and the applicable margin for Eurodollar rate loans varies from .75%
to 1.75%, each based on Delaware's leverage ratio and the type of loan.
Availability under the new bank credit agreement is subject to an unused
commitment fee which is a percentage of the unutilized revolving loan
commitment. The percentage varies from .3% to .5% based on Delaware's leverage
ratio.

         Availability under the new bank credit agreement is reduced to the
extent of the net proceeds of sales of assets by Delaware, the net proceeds of
an issuance of debt by Delaware or 50% of the net proceeds of an issuance of
equity by AP&P or Delaware. Availability will be reduced by $50,000 in 1999 and
$50,000 in 2000. The new bank credit agreement terminates in 2001. Delaware is
permitted to make acquisitions under the new bank credit agreement up to
$25,000 per acquisition without the consent of the participating banks and up
to $50,000 per acquisition if, on a pro forma basis giving effect to such
acquisition, Delaware's leverage ratio is less than 3.0 to 1.0.

         The new bank credit agreement requires Delaware to meet certain
financial tests, including minimum levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges, as defined in the
agreement), minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. The agreement
also contains covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales,
acquisitions, mergers, and other matters customarily restricted in such
agreements. The new bank credit agreement contains customary events of default,
including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant
defaults, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, certain events of
bankruptcy and insolvency, ERISA, judgment

defaults, failure of any guaranty or security agreement supporting the bank 
credit agreement to be in full force and effect, and change of control.

         The new bank credit agreement requires Delaware to continue its
interest rate cap covering a portion of the outstanding balance under the
agreement. In January 1996, Delaware entered into a four-year agreement that
entitles Delaware to receive from the counterparty on a quarterly basis the
amount, if any, by which LIBOR exceeds 6.5% for the first two years of the
agreement and 7.5% for the last two years on a notional principal amount of
$100,000. The counterparty to this agreement is a large financial institution.

         The new bank credit agreement is guaranteed by AP&P and all its
subsidiaries, except for Notepad, and is secured by substantially all assets of
Delaware and a pledge of all capital stock of Delaware and its subsidiaries.

     Senior Subordinated Notes

         Delaware issued $200,000 of 13% Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes")
through a private placement in December 1995. In June 1996, Delaware completed
an exchange of the privately-held notes for publicly-held notes with
substantially identical terms. The Notes are unsecured and subordinated to all
senior bank debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15.
The Notes are redeemable on and after November 15, 2000, at Delaware's option,
at redemption prices ranging from 106.5% of the face value of the notes in 2000
to 100% of the face value of the notes in 2003 or thereafter. Additionally, at
any time on or prior to November 15, 1998, Delaware may, at its option, use the
proceeds of public equity offerings of AP&P or Delaware to redeem up to 35% of
the Notes at redemption prices ranging from 111% to 113% of the face value of
the Notes. Subsequent to AP&P's initial public offering of common stock in July
1996, Delaware repaid $70,000 of the Notes.

         The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all subsidiaries
of Delaware, except for Notepad, on a joint and several and senior subordinated
basis, however, no guarantee from AP&P exists. At December 31, 1996, there were
no guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes contain restrictive covenants which, among
other things, limit dividends, repurchase of capital stock and investments,
incurrence of additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates and other
matters customarily restricted in such agreements.

         On December 1, 1995, $200,000 of proceeds were received from the Notes
were used to repurchase $100,000 of publicly-held notes of Williamhouse-Regency
assumed in the WR Acquisition and provide a dividend to AP&P of $75,000.


     Other

         WR seller notes in the amount of $25,157 outstanding at December 31,
1995, were repaid in January 1996 from the proceeds of the remaining borrowings
issuable under a term loan from the old bank credit agreement. The WR seller
notes bore interest at 1% and were classified as long term in the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 1995 since such debt was refinanced with
long-term debt.

         At December 31, 1996, Delaware had outstanding various industrial
revenue bonds in the aggregate amount of $10,140. The industrial revenue bonds
bear interest at rates ranging from 2.65% to 5.25%. Aggregate annual principal
payments ranging from $300 to $700 are due through 2010. Payment of principal
and interest on the industrial revenue bonds are guaranteed by Delaware. The
industrial revenue bonds are secured by letters of credit.

         At December 31, 1995 and 1996, letters of credit in the aggregate 
amount of $15,800 and $15,826, respectively, were outstanding.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         Delaware incurred fees related to the financing transactions of
approximately $33,200 and $8,620 in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which have
been deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest method over
the respective lives of the agreements.

         An extraordinary after-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,995
($33,004 pre-tax) is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 1996 as a result of $7,700 of prepayment penalties
associated with the repayment of $70,000 of Notes and the write off of $25,304
of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with such Notes and with
Delaware's old bank credit agreement. An extraordinary after-tax loss on
extinguishment of debt of $9,652 ($16,086 pretax) is reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1995 as a
result of $10,812 of prepayment penalties associated with the repurchase of
Williamhouse-Regency's $100,000 of notes and Ampad's bank debt and the
write-off of $5,274 of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with
Williamhouse-Regency's notes redemption and Ampad's debt refinancings.

10. CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION AND NONRECURRING COMPENSATION CHARGE

         Effective July 2, 1996, AP&P sold 12,500 shares of common stock in an
initial public offering. The net proceeds to AP&P from the offering, which were
received on July 8, 1996 and contributed to Delaware, amounted to $172,801
after deducting underwriting discounts, legal and accounting fees, registration
and travel expenses. Delaware used proceeds from the initial public offering
and working capital to: (i) repay $95,800 on the indebtedness incurred under
the old bank credit agreement, (ii) redeem $70,000 principal amount of the 13%
Notes from the holders thereof on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pay $7,700 in
redemption premium on such Notes.

         In 1995, AP&P issued preferred stock options to management and such
issuance of the preferred stock options by AP&P was considered additional
consideration to the option holders , which was directly related to the WR
acquisition. Delaware recorded a nonrecurring, noncash compensation charge
equal to the excess of fair market value over the exercise price of the
preferred stock options of AP&P of $24,265 with a corresponding credit being
recorded to additional paid-in capital. Additionally, options for 66 shares of
common stock of AP&P and 105 shares of preferred stock of AP&P were granted to
certain members of management in December 1995. The exercise prices of each
common share and each preferred share were below the fair market value of the
respective classes of stock at date of grant, resulting in a noncash
compensation charge equal to the aggregate excess of fair market value over the
exercise price, or $1,733, with a corresponding credit being recorded to
additional paid-in capital.

         Delaware awarded additional compensation to executives and
nonexecutives of $1,634 in 1995 in recognition of the significant transactions
consummated during the year. Delaware does not expect this additional
compensation to be awarded in future years.

11. PENSION PLAN AND 401(K) PLAN

         Delaware is a sponsor of two qualified defined benefit pension plans
and a supplemental non-qualified benefit pension plan which were assumed as
part of its acquisitions. Delaware's liabilities under such plans are included
in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

         Delaware maintains retirement plans (401(k) plan) for the benefit of
all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements. Delaware
contributions to the plans may be made at the discretion of the board of
directors. Contributions to the plans were approximately $557, $568, $1,239 for
the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

         For the year ended December 31, 1996, Delaware's statutory income tax
benefit rate of 35.0% differed from Delaware's effective income tax rate,

         The effect on the income tax provision related to the valuation
allowance was a benefit of $1,769 for the year ended December 31, 1995.
Deferred tax assets valuation allowances recorded in prior years were reversed
in 1995 as a result of management's assessment of future realizability of
deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 1994, the effect on the
income tax provision related to the valuation allowance was a charge of $1,180.
No benefit was recognized in 1994 for operating losses carried forward.

         At December 31, 1996, Delaware had net operating losses available to
reduce future taxable income of approximately $19,319. These net operating
losses expire in the years 2007 through 2011. If certain substantial changes in
Delaware's ownership should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the
amount of the carryforwards which can be utilized. In addition, Delaware has
approximately $1,363 of alternative minimum tax credit carried forward. The
acquisition of WR resulted in a change in control of WR. Consequently the
utilization of these credits in future periods are subject to limitation.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Commitments

         Delaware is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for office
space and machinery and equipment which expire at various times through 1997.
Annual minimum lease commitments under these leases amount to $3,206 in 1997,
$1,989 in 1998, $1,347 in 1999, $1,011 in 2000, $622 in 2001 and $1,386
thereafter for an aggregate of $9,561.

         Total rent expense was approximately $853, $1,888, $3,551 for 1994,
1995 and 1996 respectively.

     Litigation

         There are various outstanding claims against Delaware arising in the
normal course of business. Delaware believes that the claims are without merit
and that any losses which might ultimately be sustained by Delaware would not
be material to the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of
Delaware.

     Environmental Matters

         Delaware is subject to federal, state, and local environmental and
occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for
management of waste. While there can be no assurance that Delaware is at all
times in complete compliance with all such requirements, Delaware has made and
will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with such
requirements.

         Delaware had been named a potentially responsible party under the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, at five waste disposal sites.

Delaware settled its liability at four of these sites as a de minimis party.
Delaware expects to be eligible for a de minimis settlement at the remaining
site.

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, Delaware
expensed $575, $542 and $1,380, respectively, for management and directors'
fees and out of pocket expenses to the principal shareholders of AP&P (Bain
Capital). Unpaid fees of $500 are included in accrued expenses in the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1996. There were no unpaid fees at
December 31, 1995. In June 1996 AP&P and Delaware revised its management
services agreement with Bain Capital, pursuant to which, for four years,
Delaware will pay Bain Capital an aggregate annual fee of no less than $2,250
plus a fee of 1% for completed acquisition transactions.

         In 1996, Delaware paid Bain Capital $3,000 in fees in connection with
the new bank credit agreement, which were included in debt issuance costs paid,
$550 and $750, respectively, in fees in connection with the acquisition of
Niagara and Shade/Allied, which were included as part of the purchase price,
and $2,091 in connection with the Company's initial public offering of common
stock. In 1995, Delaware paid $7,000 to Bain Capital for services relating to
the WR acquisition and the related financing of the transaction. Of this
amount, $4,300 was included in deferred financing fees and $2,700 was a direct
acquisition expense allocated to the net assets acquired. The Company also paid
$450 to Bain Capital relating to the Globe-Weis acquisition which was included
in deferred financing fees. Delaware paid Bain Capital $225 for services
related to the SCM acquisition and the related financing of the transaction.

         At December 31, 1995, Delaware had an outstanding note receivable for
$112 from its chairman which was repaid in June 1996. At December 31, 1996, the
Company had an outstanding note receivable of $324 from its executive vice
president which is due in 1998, of which $53 was repaid in February 1997.


         Substantially all of Delaware's operations are conducted within the
United States.

         Two customers accounted for 27% and one customer accounted for 11% of
Delaware's total net sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 and 1996,
respectively.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


              THIS AGREEMENT is made as of July 2, 1996 between American Pad &
Paper Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Timothy Needham
("Executive").

              In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

I.                   Employment.  The Company shall employ Executive, and
Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending as provided in paragraph 4 hereof (the "Employment Period").

I.                   Position and Duties.

A.                   During the Employment Period, Executive shall serve as an
Executive Vice President of the Company and shall have the normal duties,
responsibilities and authority of an Executive Vice President, which shall
consist of, among other things, coordinating the Company's sales and marketing
efforts.

A.                   Executive shall report to the Company's board of directors
(the "Board") and the Company's chief executive officer, and Executive shall
devote his best efforts and his full business time and attention (except for
permitted vacation periods and reasonable periods of illness or other
incapacity) to the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Executive shall perform his duties and responsibilities to the best of his
abilities in a diligent, trustworthy, businesslike and efficient manner.

A.                   For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiaries" shall mean
any corporation of which the securities having a majority of the voting power
in electing directors are, at the time of determination, owned by the Company,
directly or through one of more Subsidiaries.
<PAGE>   2
I.                   Base Salary and Benefits.

A.                   During the first three years of the Employment Period,
Executive's base salary shall be $300,000 per annum (the "Base Salary"), which
salary shall be payable in regular installments in accordance with the
Company's general payroll practices and shall be subject to customary
withholding.  Thereafter, the Base Salary shall be such higher rate as the
Board may designate from time to time.  The Company represents and warrants
that, as of the date hereof, Executive has the third highest salary in the
Company.  In addition, during the Employment Period, Executive shall be
entitled to participate in all of the Company's employee benefit programs for
which senior executive employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
generally eligible (including the Company's stock option program).

A.                   In addition to the Base Salary, the Board will award a
bonus to Executive following the end of each fiscal year during the Employment
Period based upon a formula on Exhibit I attached hereto.  In addition to the
Base Salary and any bonuses payable to Executive pursuant to this paragraph,
Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits during the Employment
Period:

       1.            a maximum of three weeks vacation each year with salary,
       subject to additional weeks upon Board approval;

       1.            reimbursement for travel, entertainment and other business
       expenses reasonably incurred by Executive;

       1.            an automobile allowance of $500 per month;

       1.            reimbursement for all reasonable expenses relating to
       Executive's moving to Dallas, Texas area, purchasing a new residence in
       Dallas, Texas, and selling his New York residence, including all closing
       costs, inspection fees, packing and unpacking costs, but excluding any
       "points" paid to a broker or mortgage lender;

       1.            reimbursement for all reasonable costs relating to
       Executive's living in the Dallas, Texas area incurred during the first
       year following the date of this Agreement;
<PAGE>   3
              (vi)   reimbursement for the cost of an annual physical,
       examination by a physician of Executive's choice; and

              (vii)  reimbursement for the reasonable expenses of preparation
       of Executive's annual tax returns.

A.                   Termination.          The Employment Period shall continue
until Executive's resignation, death or disability or other incapacity (as
determined by the Board in its good faith judgment) or until the Board
determines in its good faith judgment that termination of Executive's
employment is in the best interests of the Company.  In the event of
Executive's resignation (other than due to a material breach by the Company of
this Agreement) or termination for Cause, Executive shall not be entitled to
receive his Base Salary or any fringe benefits or bonuses for periods after the
termination of the Employment Period.  Upon any other termination of the
Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) his Base Salary,
the health and disability benefits described in paragraph 3(a) and the fringe
benefits described in paragraph 3(b) for a period of 12 months thereafter, and
(ii) following the end of the fiscal year in which Executive's employment is
terminated and the determination of the amount of bonus which Executive would
have been entitled if he remained employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
for the entire fiscal year (the "Bonus Amount"), (A) 50% of the Bonus Amount if
such termination occurs in the first six months of such fiscal year, or (B)
100% of the Bonus Amount if such termination occurs in the second six months of
such fiscal year.

A.                   For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) the
willful and continued failure by Executive to perform his duties as an
Executive Vice President of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or his
continued failure to perform duties reasonably requested or reasonably
prescribed by the Board (other than as a result of Executive's death or
disability), (ii) the engaging by Executive in conduct which is materially
monetarily injurious to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) gross
negligence or willful misconduct by Executive in the performance of his duties
which results in, or causes, material monetary harm to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (iv) Executive's commission of a felony or other civil or
criminal offense involving moral turpitude.  In the case of (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, finding of Cause for termination shall be made only after reasonable
notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive, together with
<PAGE>   4
counsel, to be heard before the Board.  A determination of Cause by the Board
shall be effective only if agreed upon by a majority of the directors, which
shall include at least one director who is not an employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and is not employed by Bain Capital, Inc. ("Bain").

I.                   Confidential Information.  Executive acknowledges that the
information, observations and data obtained by him while employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries concerning the business or affairs of the Company
or any other Subsidiary ("Confidential Information") are the property of the
Company or such Subsidiary.  Therefore, Executive agrees that he shall not
disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his own purposes any
Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Board, unless
and to the extent that the aforementioned matters become generally known to and
available for use by the public other than as a result of Executive's acts or
omissions.  Executive shall deliver to the Company at the termination of the
Employment Period, or at any other time the Company may request, all memoranda,
notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes, printouts and software and
other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential
Information, Work Product (as defined below) or the business of the Company or
any Subsidiary which he may then possess or have under his control.

I.                   Inventions and Patents.  Executive acknowledges that all
inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs,
analyses, drawings, reports and all similar or related information (whether or
not patentable) which relate to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
actual or anticipated business, research and development or existing or future
products or services and which are conceived, developed or made by Executive
while employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Work Product") belong to
the Company or such Subsidiary.  Executive shall promptly disclose such Work
Product to the Board and perform all actions reasonably requested by the Board
(whether during or after the Employment Period) to establish and confirm such
ownership (including, without limitation, assignments, consents, powers of
attorney and other instruments).
<PAGE>   5
I.                   Non-Compete, Non-Solicitation.

A.                   In further consideration of the compensation to be paid to
Executive hereunder, Executive acknowledges that in the course of his
employment with the Company he shall become familiar  with the Company's trade
secrets and with other Confidential Information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries and that his services shall be of special, unique and
extraordinary value to the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Therefore, Executive
agrees that, during the Employment Period and for one year thereafter (the
"Noncompete Period"), he shall not directly or indirectly own any interest in,
manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for, or in any
manner engage in any business competing with the businesses of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as such businesses exist or are in process on the date of the
termination of Executive's employment, within any geographical area in which
the Company or its Subsidiaries engage or plan to engage in such businesses.
Nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more
than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is
publicly traded, so long as Executive has no active participation in the
business of such corporation.

A.                   During the Noncompete Period, Executive shall not directly
or indirectly through another entity (i) hire any person who was an employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the three-month period prior
to the expiration of the Employment Period or (ii) induce or attempt to induce
any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other business
relation of the Company or any Subsidiary to cease doing business with the
Company or such Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the relationship
between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and the
Company or any Subsidiary (including, without limitation, making any negative
statements or communications about the Company or its Subsidiaries) which
interference causes material monetary damage to the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

I.                   Enforcement.  If, at the time of enforcement of paragraph
5, 6 or 7 of this Agreement, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein
are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree
that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area.
Because Executive's services are unique and because Executive has access to
Confidential Information and Work Product, the
<PAGE>   6
parties hereto agree that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any
breach of this Agreement.  Therefore, in the event a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns may, in
addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or
other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any violations of, the provisions
hereof (without posting a bond or other security).  In addition, in the event
of an alleged breach or violation by Executive of paragraph 7, the Noncompete
Period shall be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly cured.
Executive agrees that the restrictions contained in paragraph 7 are reasonable.

I.                   Executive's Representations.  Executive hereby represents
and warrants to the Company that (i) the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Executive do not and shall not conflict with, breach, violate
or cause a default under any contract, agreement, instrument, order, judgment
or decree to which Executive is a party or by which he is bound, (ii) Executive
is not a party to or bound by any employment agreement, noncompete agreement or
confidentiality agreement with any other person or entity and (iii) upon the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, this Agreement shall
be the valid and binding obligation of Executive, enforceable in accordance
with its terms.  Executive hereby acknowledges and represents that he has
consulted with independent legal counsel regarding his rights and obligations
under this Agreement and that he fully understands the terms and conditions
contained herein.

I.                   Survival.  Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 and paragraphs 10
through 18 shall survive and continue in full force in accordance with their
terms notwithstanding any termination of the Employment Period.

be in writing and shall be either personally delivered, or mailed by first

Common Stock owned by such holder; and

                     (ii)     each holder of an Option or a Warrant shall
receive that amount equal to the Per Share Price multiplied by the number of
shares of Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the terms of such Option or

holder of Dissenting Common Shares shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw or
otherwise lose the rights of appraisal provided in the WBCL, the Dissenting
Common Shares shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into

commitment for an ALTA Owner's Title Insurance Policy for each parcel of Owned

lease-hold interest in each such parcel of Owned Real Property or the Lancaster
Property as of the Closing Date (including all recorded easements benefitting
such parcel) with gap coverage through the date of recording, subject only to
the Permitted Liens, in such amount as Parent determines to be the fair market
value (including all Improvements thereon) of such Owned Real Property  or
Lancaster Property insured thereunder (collectively, the  Title Policies").

             Each of the Title Policies shall include the following
endorsements (to the extent available in the respective jurisdiction, but

exceptions) to the extent permitted by the Title Company; (b) an ALTA Form 3.1
zoning endorsement (with parking); (c) a survey endorsement (insuring that the

such policy includes two or more adjacent parcels, a contiguity endorsement
(insuring that all of such adjacent parcels are contiguous to one another); (f)
a tax parcel number endorsement (insuring the tax parcel number in the
endorsement includes all of the Real Property insured thereunder and no other
real property); (g) an ALTA Form 9 owner's comprehensive endorsement; (h) a
non-imputation endorsement (insuring that coverage will not be defined to the
Company on the basis of any knowledge imputed to the Company by any of its
shareholders, directors, officers or employees prior to the Closing Date) and
(i) such other endorsements as reasonably requested by Parent or Parent's
lender (if any).  The Company agrees to execute and deliver all affidavits,
indemnities and such other agreements reasonably requested by the Title Company
to obtain the Title Policies as set forth above.

             7.      Surveys.  The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent
no later than ten (10) days prior to Closing, an update of the Company's most
recent survey or if there is no existing survey, a new survey for each parcel

previous surveyor, or if there is no existing survey, by Bock & Clark National
Surveyors Network or other licensed surveyor satisfactory to Acquisition, and
conforming to 1992 ALTA/ACSM Minimum Detail Requirements for Urban Land Title
Surveys, including Table A Items Nos. 1 through 4 and 6 through 13, and such
other standards as the Title Company requires as a condition to the removal of
any survey exceptions from the Title Policies, and certified to the Company,
Parent, Parent's lender (if any) and the Title Company, in a form satisfactory
to such parties (collectively, the  Surveys").  The Surveys shall not disclose
any material survey defect or encroachment from or onto any of the Real
Property which has not been cured or insured over prior to the Closing.  Parent
shall notify the Company of such survey defects or encroachment within five
business days after delivery of the Surveys to Parent and Parent's counsel.

             8.      Lease-Related Materials.  Prior to the Closing, the
Company will obtain, with respect to each parcel of Leased Real Property other
than the executive offices listed as items 5 through 8 on Schedule 7.8B, the
following documents, in such forms as Acquisition may reasonably request:  (i)

and memoranda of lease in recordable form from the lessor and/or sublessor(s)
thereof, and (ii) non-disturbance agreements from the lender(s) of any such
lessor and/or sublessor(s).

             9.      Costs and Expenses.  All costs and expenses incurred
pursuant to this Section 6.6 of this Agreement shall be the responsibility of
the Parent and shall not be Transaction Costs for any purposes of this
Agreement.

into, the Company will deliver to Acquisition a true and correct copy of any
written Contract (other than any Excludable Contract), and a complete and

(other than any Excludable Contract), which is entered into by the Company
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, whether or not
Parent's consent to the entry into such Contract is required pursuant to
Section 6.1 or Section 6.2.

             11.     HSR Act.  Each party will use reasonable best efforts to
prepare and, at such time as Acquisition designates, file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the _FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the _DOJ"), any materials and information
required to be filed with or provided to the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Parent
shall cause Acquisition to pay the filing fees associated with any such filing.
Parent, Acquisition and Company each will promptly supply any additional
information which reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC or the
DOJ.  Parent, Acquisition and Company each will take all such actions and will
file and use reasonable best efforts to have declared effective or approved,
all documents and notifications with any governmental or regulatory bodies, as
may be necessary or may reasonably be requested under federal antitrust laws
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                  TERMINATION

                 32.      Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

                 33.      by mutual written agreement of the Company and
Parent;

                 34.      by either the Company or Parent if (i) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated by
February 15, 1997 (the  Termination Date") or (ii) there has been a material
misrepresentation or breach on the part of the other party in the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, or (iii) events
have occurred which have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to
the terminating party's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (unless such terminating party's willful breach of this Agreement has
caused the condition to be unsatisfied);

                 35.      by the Company, by written notice to Parent, on any
date determined for the Closing in accordance with Section 5.1(a) if each
condition set forth in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 has been satisfied (or will
be satisfied by the delivery of documents or actions taken by the parties at
the Closing) or waived in writing on such date and Parent has nonetheless
refused to consummate the Closing Transactions; and

                 36.      by Parent, by written notice to the Company, on any
date determined for the Closing in accordance with Section 5.1(a) if each
condition set forth in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 has been satisfied (or will
be satisfied by the delivery of documents or actions taken by the parties at
the Closing) or waived in writing on such date and the Company has nonetheless
refused to consummate the Closing Transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent may not rely on the failure of any
condition precedent set forth in Section 5.2 to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by Parent's failure to act in good faith or a breach of or failure
to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the Company
may not rely on the failure of any condition precedent set forth in Section 5.3
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the Company's failure to act in
good faith or a breach of or failure to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other obligations in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                 37.      Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement is
terminated as provided in Section 9.1, then this Agreement will forthwith
become void and there will be no liability on the part of any Party to any
other Party or any other Person in respect thereof; provided that

                 38.      the obligations of the parties described in Sections
6.6(d), 9.2(d), 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 will survive any such termination,

                 39.      no such termination will relieve Parent from
liability for any misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination,
and

                 40.      no such termination of this Agreement will relieve
the Company from liability for any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
prior to such termination.

                 41.      if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section

payable by the Parent pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) of this Agreement shall

                 42.      Press Releases and Announcements.  Except for any
public disclosure which any Party in good faith believes is required by any
Legal Requirement (in which case, if practicable, the disclosing Party will
give the other Parties an opportunity to review and comment upon such
disclosure before it is made):

                 43.      prior to the Closing, no press releases related to
this Agreement or any Closing Transaction will be issued or made without the
mutual approval of the Company and Parent; and

                 44.      after the Closing, the Investors will not make any

the Surviving Corporation, this Agreement or any Closing Transaction without
the Surviving Corporation's consent.

fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel,
investment bankers, accountants, brokers or other representatives and

thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

<PAGE>   33





                 47.      bylaw provisions, articles of incorporation
provisions, or other agreements indemnifying present or former directors and
officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who serve or served as such at or
prior to the Effective Time and former, present or future fiduciaries of any

                 49.      Tax Treatment.  The Parties agree that for federal
and state tax purposes they will treat the Merger as a sale of the Common Stock
by the Stockholders to the Parent.

the Parties to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or for breach thereof,
the Party obtaining a final nonappealable judgment in its favor shall be
entitled to an award of its reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses
incurred in prosecuting or defending such action, as the case may be.

                 51.      Specific Performance.  The Parties agree that the
assets and business of the Company as a going concern constitute unique
property.  There is no adequate remedy at law for the damage which any Party
might sustain for failure of the other Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and accordingly, each Party shall be entitled,
at its option, to the remedy of specific performance to enforce the
consummation of the transactions described in this Agreement.

                 52.      Severance Policy.  Any Person who is an employee of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with
the Surviving Corporation is terminated by the Surviving Corporation on or
prior to December 31, 1997 shall receive severance benefits from the Surviving
Corporation which shall be not less than those calculated in accordance with
the policies of the Company as in effect on December 1, 1996 and described in
the Schedules attached to this Agreement.

representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall terminate at the
Effective Time and shall have no further force or effect, and shall not be
relied upon by any person, in any manner or for any reason, after the Effective
Time and the Parties shall have no liability or obligation of any kind with
respect to such representations and warranties from and after the Effective
Time.

                 54.      Amendment and Waiver.  This Agreement may only be
amended if such amendment is set forth in writing executed by the Company, the
Parent, and the Surviving Corporation (if so existing at such time) before or
after the Approval Date, but after the Approval Date, no amendment may be made
which materially adversely affects the Stockholders without prior approval of
the requisite Stockholders.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall
be binding unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party against
whom such waiver is to be enforced.  No failure by any Party to insist upon the
strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof
will constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty,
agreement or condition.

                 55.      Notices.  All notices, demands and other
communications given or delivered under this Agreement will be in writing and

hereof in any way.

                 61.      Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one

express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties
