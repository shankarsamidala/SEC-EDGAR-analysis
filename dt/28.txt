<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Nature of Operations</B>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (&#147;Allis-Chalmers&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or &#147;us&#148;) is a
multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico, and internationally, primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We operate in six sectors of the
oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling; Directional
Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel. The principal operating
costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment,
insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On October&nbsp;25, 2006 our Board of Directors approved the transfer of the listing of our common stock
from the American Stock Exchange (&#147;AMEX&#148;) to the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;). Our common
stock continued to trade on the AMEX under the symbol &#147;ALY&#148; until the transfer was completed on
March&nbsp;22, 2007, at which time we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol &#147;ALY&#148;.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Basis of Presentation</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year&#146;s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 1 &#151; NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes &#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 </I>(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January&nbsp;1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax
benefits. For United States federal tax purposes, our tax returns for
the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for examination by the
tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination
for the tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax
purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years remain open for examination
by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten
years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements </I>(&#147;SFAS 157&#148;), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;159, <I>The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities </I>(&#147;SFAS 159&#148;), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No.&nbsp;159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity&#146;s
first fiscal year that begins after November&nbsp;15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 2 &#151; STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No.&nbsp;123. We adopted SFAS
No.&nbsp;123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first three months of 2007 and 2006 based on our historical
experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our net income for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $453,000
and $0.9&nbsp;million, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. As of March
31, 2007 there is $623,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option
grants. We expect approximately $609,000 to be recognized over the remainder of 2007,
approximately $14,000 to be recognized in 2008.

is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had

that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;18, 2006 and August&nbsp;14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0&nbsp;million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January&nbsp;15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty
Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, and DLS Drilling, Logistics &#038; Services Corporation, or DLS, to
repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provides for a
$25.0&nbsp;million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January&nbsp;2010. Our January&nbsp;2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January&nbsp;2006
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0&nbsp;million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18&nbsp;months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January&nbsp;29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Oil &#038; Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0&nbsp;million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0&nbsp;million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5&nbsp;years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.9% and 7.0% at March&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amount due as of March&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31,
2006 were $6.7&nbsp;million and $7.3&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2&nbsp;million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5&nbsp;million as a result of the settlement of a

statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This report contains

For more information on forward-looking statements please refer to the section
entitled&#147;Forward-Looking Statements&#148; on page 27.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview of Our Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico and internationally primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We currently operate in six
sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling;
Directional Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. The demand for drilling
services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and
natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil
and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the &#147;rig count,&#148; is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the United
States increased from 862 as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 to 1,747 on April&nbsp;30, 2007 according to the Baker
Hughes rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of
December&nbsp;31, 2002 to 740 on April&nbsp;30, 2007, which accounted for 32.8% and 42.3% of the total U.S.
rig count, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Cyclical Nature of Equipment Rental and Services Industry</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. The most critical factor in assessing the
outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and
demand for natural gas. The peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other
cyclical industries. This is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand
and corresponding price increases. As demand increases, producers raise their prices. The price
escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. The increased capital
expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment
companies. The increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which
historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Demand for our services has been strong throughout 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, due to high oil
and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs for natural gas as
compared to other energy sources. Management believes the current market fundamentals are
indicative of a favorable long-term trend of activity in our markets. However, these factors could
be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and demand for oil and
natural gas products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Results of Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2006, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Oil &#038; Gas Rental Services,
Inc., or OGR. We report the operations of OGR in our Rental Services segment. In April&nbsp;2006, we
acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers. We report the
operations of Rogers in our Tubular Services segment. In August&nbsp;2006, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics &#038; Services Corporation, or DLS, and in December&nbsp;2006,
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Tanus Argentina S.A., or Tanus. We report the
operations of DLS and Tanus in our International Drilling segment. In October&nbsp;2006, we acquired
all of the outstanding stock of Petro-Rentals, Incorporated, or Petro Rentals. We report the
operations of Petro Rentals in our Production Services segment. We consolidated the results of
these acquisitions from the day they were acquired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical
results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Comparison of Three Months Ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 were $135.9&nbsp;million, an increase of 183.7%
compared to $47.9&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments due to acquisitions completed in 2006, the investment in new capital
equipment, increased utilization of our rental equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new
operating locations. The most significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS
on August&nbsp;14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, International
Drilling. Revenues also increased significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR
acquisition on December&nbsp;18, 2006 and increased utilization of our rental equipment. Revenues for
our Production Services segment increased due to the acquisition of Petro-Rentals on October&nbsp;17,
2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our Tubular Services
segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the acquisition of Rogers as
of April&nbsp;3, 2006, along with improved market conditions. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues
increased in the 2007 period compared to the 2006 period due to improved pricing for directional
drilling and the purchase of additional down-hole motors and measurement-while-drilling tools, or
MWD, tools which increased our capacity and market presence. Revenues increased at our
Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment, principally new
compressor packages.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our gross margin for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 increased 180.3% to $46.5&nbsp;million, or 34.2%
of revenues, compared to $16.6&nbsp;million, or 34.6%, of revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,
2006. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business
segments. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower
gross margin that DLS achieves in the international drilling segment. The lower margin from DLS
was partly offset by the acquisition of OGR on December&nbsp;18, 2006, in the high margin rental
services business, increased utilization of our rental equipment and the improved pricing for our
services generally. Also, contributing to our gross profit margin was the purchase of additional
MWD tools, the acquisition of Rogers and Petro Rentals, and the addition of two coil tubing units
in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in
depreciation expense of 254.8% to $11.8&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $3.3
million for the first quarter of 2006. The increase is due to additional depreciable assets
resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues consists
principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our
equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit
as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">General and administrative expense was $14.0&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $7.3
million for the first quarter of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due to the
additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
accounting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal
control processes, costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate
accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative
expenses were 10.3% in the first quarter of 2007 compared to 15.3% in the first quarter of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment, </I>effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Therefore, we recorded an expense
of $453,000 and $0.9&nbsp;million related to stock options for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The amount of option expense recorded in general and administrative expense
was $391,000 for the first quarter of 2007 and $859,000 for the first quarter of 2006 with the
balance being recorded as a direct cost.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amortization expense was $1.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $607,000 in the
first quarter of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of
intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income from operations for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 totaled $31.0&nbsp;million, a 259.3%
increase over income from operations of $8.6&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and
administrative expenses and amortization. Our income from operations as a percentage of revenues
increased to 22.8% for the first quarter of 2007 from 18.0% for the first quarter of 2006, due
principally to the decrease in general, administrative and amortization expenses as a percentage of
revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our net interest expense was $12.8&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $3.6&nbsp;million
for the first quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased in the first quarter of 2007 due to our
increased debt at a higher average interest rate. In January of 2007 we issued $250.0&nbsp;million of
senior notes bearing interest at 8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to complete the
OGR acquisition and for working capital. The bridge loan was outstanding until January&nbsp;29, 2007
and had an average interest rate of 10.6%. In August of 2006 we issued an additional $95.0&nbsp;million
of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the acquisition of DLS. Interest
expense for the first quarter of 2007 includes the write-off of deferred financing fees of $1.2
million related to the repayment of the bridge loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our provision for income taxes for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 was $6.2&nbsp;million, or 33.9% of
our net income before income taxes, compared to $607,000, or 12.1% of our net income before income
taxes for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. The increase in income taxes is attributable to
our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The increase in our effective tax
rate is primarily attributable to our operations in Argentina which had an effective tax rate of
32.4% and the release of the valuation allowance against income taxes in United States in the
fourth quarter of 2006, which has resulted in deferred tax expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had net income of $12.2&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 175.0%, compared
to net income of $4.4&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were $20.5
million, an increase of 28.6% from the $15.9&nbsp;million in revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31,
2006. Income from operations increased 64.5% to $4.3&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2007 from
$2.6&nbsp;million for the comparable 2006 period. The improved results for this segment are due to
improved pricing for directional and horizontal drilling and the purchase of an additional six MWD
tools. Our increased operating expenses as a result of the addition of operations and personnel
were more than offset by the growth in revenues and improved pricing for our services.

an increase of 52.1% from the $9.5&nbsp;million in revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006.
Revenues from domestic operations increased to $12.6&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007 from $8.0
million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Rogers. Revenues from
operations in Mexico were $1.8&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2007 and $1.5&nbsp;million for the first
quarter of 2006. Income from operations increased 72.5% to $3.2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of
2007 from $1.9&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in this segment&#146;s operating
income was due to our increased revenues from domestic operations.

income from operations of $2.2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006. Our Underbalanced Drilling
revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2007 increased compared to the first quarter

to the increase in payroll costs and benefits for additional management, accounting and

increased franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares and increased audit fees and
professional services related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort.

Net income for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 was $12.2&nbsp;million. Non-cash expenses totaled
$15.8&nbsp;million during the first three months of 2007 consisting of $13.3&nbsp;million of depreciation and
amortization, $1.5&nbsp;million for deferred taxes related to timing differences, $1.2&nbsp;million for the

$13.4&nbsp;million in cash, principally due to an increase of $22.0&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.8&nbsp;million in inventory, a decrease of $3.2&nbsp;million in accrued interest, offset in
part by a decrease in other current assets of $7.3&nbsp;million, an increase of $3.4&nbsp;million in accounts
payable and an increase of $2.1&nbsp;million in accrued expenses. Accounts receivable increased
primarily due to the increase in our revenues in the first three months of 2007. Other inventory
increased primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the demands of increased activity
levels. The decrease in accrued interest relates to the semi-annual payment of interest on our
9.0% senior notes issued in 2006 in January&nbsp;2007. The decrease in other current assets primarily
relates to the collection of the working capital adjustment of the OGR acquisition for
approximately $7.1&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses can be attributed to additional expenses related to higher activity levels.

decrease of $11.0&nbsp;million in an accrued expense, offset in part by an increase of $2.8&nbsp;million in
accrued interest. Accounts receivable increased from the December&nbsp;31, 2005 level, due to the
increase in our revenues in the first three months of 2006, which is primarily attributable to the
Specialty acquisition. Inventory increased primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the
demands of our increased activity levels. The decrease in accrued expenses can be attributed to
accrued bonuses of Specialty that we paid in connection with the acquisition. The increase in
accrued interest relates to the interest on our 9.0% senior notes that is only paid semi-annually.

performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which
in turn are affected by our customers&#146; expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development,
and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where
we operate. We will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide
funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we may require
additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable

value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007, and

instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No.&nbsp;159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, regarding our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements. Although such forward-looking statements reflect our good faith
judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us.
Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and
actual outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Further information about the risks and uncertainties that may impact
us are described under &#147;Item&nbsp;1A&#151;Risk Factors&#148; in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006. You should read those sections carefully. You should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. We
undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance occurring after the date of this quarterly report or currently unknown facts
or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange risks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Interest Rate Risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable
rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. We are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in
interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans carrying variable interest rates
with an outstanding balance of $6.7&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value
because of their highly liquid short-term nature. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, we had $64.2&nbsp;million
invested in short-term investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have designated the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international
locations as we contract with customers, purchase equipment and finance capital using the U.S.
dollar. Local currency transaction gains and losses, arising from remeasurement of certain assets
and liabilities denominated in local currency, are included in our consolidated statements of
income. We conduct business in Mexico through our Mexican partner, Matyep. This business exposes
us to foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, we provide for payment in U.S. dollars.
However, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50% of any loss
suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the Mexican peso between the date of
invoicing and the date of payment. To date, such payments have not been material in amount.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e)
and 15d &#150; 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these
officers have concluded that, as of March&nbsp;31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules and
forms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting:

and warranties in the Loan Documents, each Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees to make
revolving loans (each such loan a &#147;<B><I>Revolving Loan</I></B>&#148;) to Borrower from time to time on any Business
Day during the period from the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date to the Maturity Date, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share
of one or more Revolving Loan Borrowings not to exceed, when aggregated with the Outstanding Amount
of the L/C Obligations, such Lender&#146;s Revolving Commitment. Revolving Loan Borrowings may be
repaid and reborrowed from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents; <I>provided that</I>, each such Revolving Loan Borrowing must occur on a Business Day and no
later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Revolving Loans may be Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; <I>provided, however, </I>all Revolving
Loan Borrowings made on the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans.</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Revolving Loans.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Each Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from one interest rate Type to the
other, and each continuation of Revolving Loans as the same interest rate Type shall be made upon
the Borrower&#146;s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.
Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00&nbsp;a.m., New York
time, three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and one Business Day prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Base Rate Loans. Each such telephonic notice must
be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by an authorized officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000
or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.
Each Borrowing Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i)&nbsp;whether the Borrower is
requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Loans from one interest rate Type to the other,
or a continuation of Revolving Loans as the same interest rate Type, (ii)&nbsp;the requested date of the
Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii)
the principal amount of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (v)&nbsp;the interest
rate Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans are to be
converted, and (vi)&nbsp;if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If
the Borrower fails to specify the interest rate Type for a Revolving Loan in a Borrowing Notice or
if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the
applicable Revolving Loans shall be made or continued as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any
such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest
Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such
Borrowing Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an
Interest Period of one month.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Following receipt of a Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding </DIV>

Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of such Lender&#146;s Pro
Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the

liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused
by the L/C Issuer&#146;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer&#146;s willful failure to

on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity
or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a

Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations

contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or

or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall ever be entitled to contract for, charge,
take, reserve, receive, or apply, as interest on all or any part of the Obligations, any amount in
excess of the Maximum Rate, and, if any Lender ever does so, then such excess shall be deemed a
partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such and any remaining excess shall be
refunded to the Borrower. In determining if the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the Borrower and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, (a)&nbsp;treat
all Borrowings as but a single extension of credit (and the Lenders and the Borrower agree that
such is the case and that provision herein for multiple Borrowings is for convenience only), (b)
characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (c)
exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations.
However, if the Obligations are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full
contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof
exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Lenders shall refund such excess, and, in such event, the Lenders
shall not, to the extent permitted by Law, be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for
contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount.
To the extent the Laws of the State of Texas are applicable for purposes of determining the

revolving credit loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts), does not apply to the
Obligations.

to Collateral, nor shall it be under any duty whatsoever to anyone except Debtor to account

Debtor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Secured Party the proxy and
