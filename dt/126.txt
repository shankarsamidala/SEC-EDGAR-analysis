    forth in its Annual Report to Stockholders and its Report on Form 10-K
    filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Users of financial
    information produced for interim periods are encouraged to refer to the

    recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated
    financial condition, results of operations, and changes in financial
    position and stockholders' equity of Anacomp and its subsidiaries for

3.  In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
    (FAS 109).  Under FAS 109, the Company recognizes income taxes under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The liability method
    measures the expected tax impact of future taxable income or deductions
    resulting from differences in the tax and financial reporting bases of
    assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and the
    expected tax impact of carryforwards for tax purposes.  A valuation
    allowance is to be recorded against those tax assets when it is "more
    likely than not" that the benefit will not be realized.

    FAS 109 was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 1994.  The Company
    recorded a deferred tax asset of $95 million representing the federal and
    state tax NOLs and tax credits.  The Company also recorded a valuation
    allowance of $60 million reducing the deferred tax asset to a net $35
    million.

    Recognition of the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance caused
    adjustments to the following financial statement components:

    In the future, the federal provision for income taxes reflected in the
    consolidated statement of operations will generally not require a cash
    payout to the extent the Company has NOLs.  The cash savings from the
    utilization of NOLs will be reported as a reduction of the deferred tax
    asset recorded under the guidelines of FAS 109.

    The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 and
    October 1, 1993 are as follows:

    At December 31, 1993 the Company had NOLs of approximately $220 million
    available to offset future taxable income.  An additional $34 million is
    available in future periods as accrued expenses become deductible.  The
    Company also has tax credit carryforwards of $3 million available to reduce
    future tax liabilities, including $1 million of preacquisition tax credits.
    The NOLs expire commencing in 1995 ($15 million) with remaining amounts in
    various periods through 2007.  The tax credit carryforwards expire
    substantially in 1997.

    The adoption of FAS 109 reduced goodwill amortization expense by
    $193 thousand during the three month period ended December 31, 1993.
    Accordingly, income from continuing operations and net income were
    increased by the same amount.  There was no effect on earnings per common
    and common equivalent share.

    If FAS 109 had been adopted beginning October 1, 1992, the following
    proforma results would have been reported for the three month period ended

    Income from continuing operations..........  $  2,135        $  1,862

    Earnings per common and common
      equivalent share.........................       .03             .21
</TABLE>

4. The computation of earnings per common and common equivalent share is based
    upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period plus (in periods in which they have a dilutive effect) the effect of
    common shares contingently issuable, primarily from stock options and
    exercise of warrants.

    The fully diluted per share computation reflects the effect of common
    shares contingently issuable upon the exercise of warrants in periods in
    which such exercise would cause dilution.  Fully diluted earnings per share
    also reflect additional dilution related to stock options due to the use of
    the market price at the end of the period, when higher than the average
    price for the period.

    Fully diluted earnings per share are the same as primary earnings per share
    for the periods presented.

5. Effective January 3, 1994, the Company purchased the computer output
   micrographics business of 14 data centers operated by National Business
   Systems for $14.8 million using equal amounts of common stock and cash.

Total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 1994 were essentially level
with the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 after consideration of the foreign
exchange translation impact of approximately $2 million.  COM systems revenues,
however, were up $2.3 million, or 16%, over the prior year on strong XFP
shipments.  Micrographics service and maintenance service revenues were each up
3%.  Micrographic supplies revenues were off $6.8 million, or 13% principally
due to decreased duplicate film and reader printer sales in the OEM channels.

Service revenues generated a gross profit margin of 32% in the first quarter up
from 31% in the prior year first quarter.  Equipment and supply sales generated
a gross profit margin of 30% compared to 29% in the prior year.  The improved
margins result largely from the cost reduction efforts launched in the third
quarter of fiscal year 1993.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 16% of total revenues
in both periods.

The first quarter financial statements reflect the Company's adoption of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
December 31, 1993 Balance Sheet includes a $34,667,000 deferred tax asset and
the Consolidated Statements of Operations include a $8,000,000 one time
adjustment reflecting the cumulative effect on prior years.

Working capital amounted to $35.5 million at December 31, 1993 compared to
$30.9 million at September 30, 1993.  As disclosed in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, net cash used in operating activities improved $7.4
in the first quarter of fiscal year 1994 compared to the first quarter of
fiscal 1993, primarily due to reductions in working capital.  Net cash used in
financing activities was reduced $22.3 million dollars reflecting lower
paydowns on the Company's revolving line of credit and resulting in the year to
year increase in cash balances of $21.0 million.  The Company believes that
operating cash flow in 1994 will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for
capital expenditures, debt repayments, and other obligations.
