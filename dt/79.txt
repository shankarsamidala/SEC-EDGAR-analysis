(a)           BASIS OF PRESENTATION
              The consolidated  financial  statements have been prepared by AT&T
              Corp.  (AT&T)  pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the
              Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) and, in the opinion of
              management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement
              of the consolidated results of operations,  financial position and
              cash flows for each period presented. The consolidated results for
              interim periods are not necessarily  indicative of results for the
              full year.  These financial  results should be read in conjunction
              with AT&T's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999,  filed
              on March 27,  2000,  which  include the  financial  statements  of
              Liberty Media Group for the year ended  December 31, 1999,  AT&T's
              Form 10-Q for the quarter  ended March 31, 2000,  (which  includes
              the  financial  results of Liberty  Media  Group for this  period,
              attached as an exhibit  thereto) and the  financial  statements of
              Liberty  Media Group and AT&T  Wireless  Group for the quarter and
              year-to-date  periods  ended June 30,  2000,  included as Exhibits
              99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to this AT&T quarterly report on Form
              10-Q.

              During the second quarter,  AT&T created a new class of stock when
              it completed an initial  public  offering of 360 million shares of
              AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at a price of $29.50 per share.
              This stock is designed to track the performance of AT&T's wireless
              services  business  and  represented  a  15.6%  interest  in  that
              business.  AT&T  retained  the  remaining  84.4%  interest in AT&T
              Wireless Group. In addition to AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock,
              AT&T has two other  classes of stock,  Liberty  Media  Group (LMG)
              tracking stock and AT&T common stock. Liberty Media Group tracking
              stock is  intended  to reflect the  performance  of Liberty  Media
              Group. AT&T common stock is intended to reflect the performance of
              all other  businesses  of AT&T,  referred to as AT&T Common  Stock
              Group, including AT&T's retained interest in AT&T Wireless Group.

              The earnings  attributable  to AT&T Wireless Group represent 15.6%
              of the  earnings  from  April 27,  2000,  the date of the  initial
              public offering,  through June 30, 2000. The remaining earnings of
              AT&T's  wireless  services  business  are included in the earnings
              attributable to AT&T Common Stock Group.  Similarly,  the earnings
              or losses  related to LMG are excluded from earnings  available to
              AT&T Common Stock Group.

              The  Board  of  Directors  of  Liberty  Media  Group   declared  a
              two-for-one  stock split of Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock,
              paid on June 9, 2000. At the AT&T Corp.  annual meeting on May 24,
              2000,  shareowners approved an amendment to increase the number of
              authorized  shares of Class A Liberty Media Stock from 2.5 billion
              to 4 billion,  and to increase the number of Class B Liberty Media
              Stock from 250 million to 400 million. All references to number of
              shares and per share  information  for Liberty  Media Group in the
              consolidated  financial  statements  have been adjusted to reflect
              the stock split on a retroactive basis.

              We have reclassified  certain prior period amounts to conform with
              our current presentation.


(b)           MERGERS

              MERGER WITH MEDIAONE GROUP, INC. (MEDIAONE)
              On June 15, 2000,  AT&T completed a merger with MediaOne in a cash
              and stock transaction valued at approximately $56 billion.  In the
              aggregate,  each share of MediaOne  stock received 0.95 of a share
              of AT&T common stock and $36.27 per share in cash,  consisting  of
              $30.85 per share as stipulated  in the merger  agreement and $5.42
              per share based on AT&T's stock price  preceding  the merger being
              below  a  predetermined  amount.  AT&T  issued  approximately  606
              million shares of common stock, of which  approximately 60 million
              were  treasury  shares.  The total shares had an aggregate  market
              value of approximately $21 billion. In addition, the cash payments
              totaled  approximately $24 billion and AT&T assumed debt and other
              obligations of approximately $11 billion.

              The  merger  was  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method  of
              accounting, accordingly the results of MediaOne have been included
              in the financial results of AT&T since the date of acquisition.

              The operating results of MediaOne, which are part of our Broadband
              segment,  have  been  included  in the  accompanying  consolidated
              financial  statements at their  preliminary fair value at June 15,
              2000.  Approximately  $19  billion  of the  purchase  price of $56
              billion  was  attributed  to  agreements   with  local   franchise
              authorities  that allow access to homes in our  broadband  service
              areas   ("franchise   costs")   and  is  being   amortized   on  a
              straight-line  basis  over  40  years.  Also  included  in the $56
              billion  purchase price was  approximately  $28 billion related to
              nonconsolidated investments,  including investments in Time Warner
              Entertainment and Vodaphone Group,  plc,  approximately $6 billion
              related  to  property,  plant  and  equipment,  approximately  $10
              billion  attributable  to  MediaOne  debt,  and  approximately  $1
              billion of minority  interest  in Centaur  Funding.  The  purchase
              resulted in  preliminary  goodwill of $16 billion,  which is being
              amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over 40 years.  We may make
              refinements  to the  allocation  of the  purchase  price in future
              periods as the related fair value appraisals of certain assets and
              liabilities are finalized.

              MERGER WITH TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, INC. (TCI)
              In March 1999,  AT&T  completed a merger  with TCI,  renamed  AT&T
              Broadband  (Broadband),  in an  all-stock  transaction  valued  at
              approximately $52 billion.  The merger was accounted for under the
              purchase  method of accounting  and,  accordingly,  the results of
              Broadband  have been included  with the financial  results of AT&T
              since the acquisition.

              In connection  with the closing,  AT&T issued a separate  tracking
              stock  designed to reflect  the  economic  performance  of Liberty
              Media  Group  (LMG),   TCI's  former  programming  and  technology
              investment business.

              AT&T does not have a controlling  financial interest for financial
              accounting  purposes in LMG;  therefore,  our investment in LMG is
              accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  in  the   accompanying
              consolidated financial statements. The amounts attributable to LMG
              are  reflected as separate line items  "Equity  earnings  (losses)
              from Liberty Media Group" and  "Investment  in Liberty Media Group
              and related  receivables,  net," in the accompanying  consolidated
              financial statements.

              PRO FORMA RESULTS
              Following is a summary of the pro forma  results of AT&T as if the
              mergers  with  MediaOne  and TCI had closed  effective  January 1,

(c)           NET RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
              During the second quarter of 1999, we recorded  restructuring  and
              other charges that netted to a pretax  benefit of $29. The benefit
              included a $68 net gain  primarily  related to the exit of certain
              joint  ventures that would have  competed with Concert,  our joint
              venture with British  Telecommunications  plc (BT).  Also included
              was an $11 gain from the  settlement of pension  obligations  from
              AT&T's   voluntary   retirement   incentive   program.   Partially
              offsetting  these  gains  was a $50  pretax  charge  related  to a
              contribution  agreement  entered  into  by  Broadband  to  satisfy
              certain  liabilities of  Phoenixstar,  Inc.  (formerly  PrimeStar,
              Inc.).

              Net  restructuring and other charges for the six months ended June
              30, 2000, totaled $773. The charge included restructuring and exit
              costs of $682 relating to actions  across  several of our business
              units.  These  actions  were  primarily  driven  by the  company's
              continuing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs by $2
              billion by the end of the year.  Also  recorded  in the six months
              ended  June 30,  2000,  was a $91 charge  related to the  mandated
              disposition of AT&T  Communications  (U.K.) Ltd., which would have
              competed directly with Concert.

              The charge included cash  termination  benefits of $458 associated
              with  the  involuntary   separation  of  about  6,200   employees.
              Approximately   one-half  of  the   individuals   were  management
              employees and one-half were nonmanagement  employees.  Over 35% of
              the affected  employees  have left their  positions as of June 30,
              2000,  and the remaining  employees  will leave the company in the
              second half of the year.

              We  also  recorded  $62  of  network  lease  and  other   contract
              termination  costs  associated with penalties  incurred as part of
              notifying vendors of the termination of these contracts during the
              first quarter of 2000.

              The  following  table  displays  the  activity and balances of the
              restructuring  reserve  account from January 1, 2000,  to June 30,

              Deductions  reflect  cash  payments  of $253  related to  employee
              separations  and noncash  utilization  of $57. The cash outlay was
              primarily funded through cash from operations. Noncash utilization
              included deferred severance primarily related to executives.

              Also included in  restructuring  and exit costs for the six months
              ended  June  30,  2000,  was  $144 of  benefit  curtailment  costs
              associated with employee  separations as part of these exit plans.
              We also recorded an asset impairment  charge of $18 related to the
              write-down of unrecoverable  assets in certain businesses in which
              the carrying value is no longer supported by future cash flows.

              As a  result  of our  merger  with  MediaOne  and as  part  of our
              objective to benefit from the synergies  created by the merger, we
              will record further  charges for exit and separation  plans in the
              second half of the year.

              Net  restructuring and other charges for the six months ended June
              30, 1999,  totaled $702. The charge  included a pretax  in-process
              research  and  development  charge  of  $594  related  to the  TCI
              acquisition,  a $128  pretax net charge  primarily  related to the
              exit of certain joint  ventures that would have competed  directly
              with Concert and a $50 pretax  charge  related to the  Phoenixstar
              agreement  noted above.  These charges were partially  offset by a
              $70 pretax gain related to the  settlement of pension  obligations
              for former  employees  who accepted  AT&T's  voluntary  retirement
              incentive program offer.

(d)           EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE AND POTENTIAL COMMON SHARE

              Basic earnings per share (EPS) for AT&T Common Stock Group for the
              three and  six-month  periods  ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,  were
              computed by dividing  earnings  attributable  to AT&T Common Stock
              Group  shareowners by the  weighted-average  number of AT&T common
              shares outstanding during the period.

              Diluted EPS for AT&T Common  Stock Group was  computed by dividing
              earnings  attributable  to AT&T Common  Stock  Group  shareowners,
              adjusted for the conversion of securities, by the weighted-average
              number of AT&T common shares and dilutive  potential common shares
              outstanding  during  the  period,   assuming   conversion  of  the
              potential common shares at the beginning of the periods presented.

              convertible  debt  securities of a  subsidiary,  stock options and
              other  performance  awards  have  been  included  in  the  diluted
              calculation  of  weighted-average  shares to the  extent  that the
              assumed  issuance  of such  shares  would have been  dilutive,  as
              illustrated  below.  The convertible  quarterly  income  preferred
              securities   were   antidilutive   and  were   excluded  from  the
              computation of diluted EPS. The dividends on these securities have
              an after-tax impact to quarterly  earnings of  approximately  $40.
              Assuming the conversion of these  securities,  the dividends would
              no  longer  be  included  as a  reduction  to net  income  and the
              securities would convert into 66.667 million shares of AT&T common
              stock.

              A  reconciliation  of the income and share  components for diluted
              EPS  calculations  with  respect to AT&T Common  Stock Group is as
              follows:

              Basic EPS for AT&T Wireless  Group for the period from the date of
              the initial public offering through June 30, 2000, was computed by
              dividing  the  income   attributable   to  AT&T   Wireless   Group
              shareowners by the  weighted-average  number of shares outstanding
              of  AT&T  Wireless  Group  of 360  million.  Potentially  dilutive
              securities  consisted of  approximately  70 million stock options,
              which were antidilutive at June 30, 2000.

              Basic EPS for LMG was  computed by dividing  the  earnings  (loss)
              attributable to LMG shareowners by the weighted-average  number of
              shares outstanding of LMG of 2,576 million and 2,528 million,  for
              the three months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and
              2,570  million and 2,500 million for the six months ended June 30,
              2000  and  from the date of  acquisition  through  June 30,  1999,
              respectively.

              Potentially  dilutive  securities,  including  fixed and nonvested
              performance awards and stock options,  have not been factored into
              the dilutive  calculations because past history has indicated that
              these  contracts  are  generally  settled  in cash.  There were 95
              million and 108 million of these potentially  dilutive  securities
              outstanding at June 30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The diluted
              earnings per share calculation for the second quarter of 2000 does
              include approximately one million warrants outstanding at June 30,
              2000, which were assumed in a recent acquisition.  Since LMG had a
              loss in the quarter and  year-to-date  periods of 1999, the impact
              of any potential shares would have been antidilutive.

(e)           RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
              AT&T has various  related  party  transactions  with  Concert as a
              result of the closure of the global venture in early January.

              Included in revenue in the three and six-month  periods ended June
              30, 2000, are $284 and $550,  respectively,  for services provided
              to Concert.

              Included in access and other connection expenses for the three and
              six-month  periods  ended June 30, 2000,  are charges from Concert
              representing costs incurred on our behalf to connect calls made to
              foreign  countries  (international  settlements) and costs paid by
              AT&T to Concert for distributing  Concert  products  totaling $581
              and $1,160, respectively.

              During the first  quarter of 2000,  AT&T  loaned  $1.0  billion to
              Concert which is included within  investments and related advances
              in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets.  Interest income
              of $17 and $30 was recognized for the three and six-month  periods
              ended June 30, 2000, respectively.

              Included in accounts  receivable and accounts  payable at June 30,
              2000, are $1,064 and $1,138, respectively, related to transactions
              with Concert.

(f)           LONG-TERM DEBT

              EXCHANGEABLE NOTES

              During  1999 and 1998,  MediaOne  issued  debt  (the  Exchangeable
              Notes) which is mandatorily  redeemable at MediaOne's  option into
              (i) Vodafone American Depository Receipts (ADRs) held by MediaOne,
              (ii)  the cash  equivalent,  or  (iii) a  combination  of cash and
              Vodafone ADRs. The maturity value of the Exchangeable Notes varies
              based upon the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR.

              Following is a summary of the  Exchangeable  Notes  outstanding by
              year of issue:

              The  redemption  formula  for the  1999  Exchangeable  Notes is as
              follows:

              (a)     If the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR is greater than
                      or  equal  to  $51.2563, each  1999  Exchangeable  Note is
                      equivalent to 0.8475 of a Vodafone ADR;

              (b)     If the fair market value of a Vodafone ADR is less than or
                      equal  to  $43.4375,  each   1999  Exchangeable  Note   is
                      equivalent to one Vodafone ADR; or

              (c)     If the fair market  value of  a Vodafone ADR  is less than
                      $51.2563  but greater  than $43.4375 per share,  each 1999
                      Exchangeable  Note  is  equivalent  to  a  fraction  of  a
                      Vodafone  ADR equal to (i)  $43.4375  divided  by (ii) the
                      fair market value of one Vodafone ADR.

              The number of Vodafone  ADRs to be  exchanged at maturity for each
              1998  Exchangeable  Note will be based upon a redemption  value of
              $9.00 in cash plus 2 1/2 times the fair market value of a Vodafone
              ADR (the Maturity Price), as follows:

              (a)     If the  Maturity Price is greater than or equal  to $71.75
                      per share, each  1998 Exchangeable  Note is equivalent  to
                      0.8101 of the Maturity Price;

              (b)     If the Maturity Price is less than or equal to $58.125 per
                      share, each  1998 Exchangeable  Note is equivalent  to the
                      Maturity Price; or

              (c)     If the  Maturity Price is  less than $71.75 per  share but
                      greater than  $58.125  per share, each  1998  Exchangeable
                      Note is equivalent to $58.125.

              The  Exchangeable  Notes are being  accounted  for as indexed debt
              instruments since the maturity value of the Exchangeable  Notes is
              dependent  upon the fair market value of the  underlying  Vodafone
              ADRs. For the 1999 debt issuance,  the market risk of a decline in
              value of Vodafone ADRs below $43.4375 per share on 26.0 million of
              the  148.3  million  Vodafone  ADRs  held  by  MediaOne  has  been
              eliminated. In addition,  MediaOne has limited the market gains it
              may earn to 15.25% of the fair market  value in excess of $51.2563
              per  share  on 26.0  million  Vodafone  ADRs.  For the  1998  debt
              issuance,  the market risk of a decline in value of Vodafone  ADRs
              below  $19.65  per  share on 72.5  million  of the  148.3  million
              Vodafone ADRs held by MediaOne has been  eliminated.  In addition,
              MediaOne has limited the market gains it may earn to approximately
              19% of the fair market value in excess of $25.10 per share on 72.5
              million Vodafone ADRs.

              Since  the  Vodafone  ADRs  are a  cost  method  investment  being
              accounted for as  "available-for-sale"  securities under Statement
              of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for
              Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," changes in the
              maturity  value of the  Exchangeable  Notes are being  recorded as
              unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, within other comprehensive
              income as a component of shareowners' equity.

              The  Exchangeable  Notes are  unsecured  obligations  of MediaOne,
              ranking  equally in right of payment with all other  unsecured and
              unsubordinated obligations of MediaOne.

              FLOATING RATE DEBT

              Two subsidiaries of MediaOne, MediaOne SPC IV and MediaOne SPC VI,
              entered into a series of purchased and written options on Vodafone
              ADRs  contributed  to them by MediaOne  and issued  floating  rate
              debt. The carrying value of debt outstanding at June 30, 2000, was
              $1,739,  which pays  interest  at  three-month  London  Inter-Bank
              Offering  Rate  (LIBOR)  plus  0.5%.  This debt  matures  in equal
              quarterly  installments  beginning in 2003 and ending in 2005. The
              assets of  MediaOne  SPC IV,  which  are  primarily  29.1  million
              Vodafone ADRs, are only available to pay the creditors of MediaOne
              SPC IV.  Likewise,  the  assets  of  MediaOne  SPC VI,  which  are
              primarily  18.0 million  Vodafone  ADRs, are only available to pay
              the creditors of MediaOne SPC VI.

              OF AN AT&T SUBSIDIARY

              Certain  subsidiary  trusts of MediaOne (the MediaOne  Trusts) had
              preferred securities outstanding at June 30, 2000, as follows:

              MediaOne Finance III             9.04%      2038         503

              Total                                                 $1,043

              The MediaOne Trusts exist for the exclusive purpose of issuing the
              Trust Preferred Securities and investing the proceeds thereof into
              Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Notes (the  Subordinated  Debt
              Securities)  of  MediaOne  Group  Funding,   Inc,  a  wholly-owned
              subsidiary of MediaOne.  The Subordinated Debt Securities have the
              same  interest  rate  and  maturity  date as the  Trust  Preferred
              Securities to which they relate.  The Subordinated Debt Securities
              are fully and unconditionally  guaranteed by MediaOne.  All of the
              Subordinated  Debt  Securities  are  redeemable by MediaOne  Group
              Funding,  Inc.  or MediaOne  at a  redemption  price of $25.00 per
              security, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon redemption of the
              Subordinated Debt Securities,  the Trust Preferred Securities will
              be mandatorily  redeemable,  at a price of $25.00 per share,  plus
              accrued and unpaid distributions. The 9.30% and 7.96% Subordinated
              Debt Securities are redeemable after September 11, 2000. The 9.50%
              and  8.25%  Subordinated  Debt  Securities  are  redeemable  after
              October 29,  2001.  The 9.04%  Subordinated  Debt  Securities  are
              redeemable after October 28, 2003. The Trust Preferred  Securities
              are   recorded   within   long-term   debt  in  the   accompanying
              consolidated balance sheets.

(g)           FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

              COLLARS
              Two subsidiaries of MediaOne, MediaOne SPC IV and MediaOne SPC VI,
              entered   into  a  series  of   purchased   and  written   options
              (collectively the collars) on Vodafone ADRs contributed to them by
              MediaOne  and issued  floating  rate debt.  The collars  have been
              designated  and  are  effective  as a  hedge  of the  market  risk
              associated  with the  investment in Vodafone ADRs. The collars are
              therefore  carried at intrinsic  value,  with unrealized  gains or
              losses,  net of tax,  being  recorded  within other  comprehensive
              income as a component of  shareowners'  equity,  together with any
              change in the fair value of the Vodafone ADRs.

              At the  expiration of the MediaOne SPC IV collar,  we will receive
              cash  if  the  market  value  of  a  Vodafone  ADR  is  less  than
              approximately $34.00 per share,  effectively  eliminating downside
              risk on the stock  below  $34.00  per  share.  Conversely,  if the
              market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is  greater  than  approximately
              $49.00 per share,  we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
              offset by the corresponding  increase in the value of the Vodafone
              ADR. This collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in
              2005.

              At the  expiration of the MediaOne SPC VI collar,  we will receive
              cash  if  the  market  value  of  a  Vodafone  ADR  is  less  than
              approximately $40.00 per share,  effectively  eliminating downside
              risk on the stock  below  $40.00  per  share.  Conversely,  if the
              market  value of a  Vodafone  ADR is  greater  than  approximately
              $58.00 per share,  we will be required to pay cash,  which will be
              offset by the corresponding  increase in the value of the Vodafone
              ADR. This collar expires quarterly beginning in 2003 and ending in
              2005.

              INTEREST RATE SWAPS
              In  connection  with the floating rate debt issued by MediaOne SPC
              IV and VI,  interest  rate  swaps  were  entered  into to swap the
              floating  rate debt to fixed rate debt.  The  interest  rate swaps
              have the same maturities as the debt and mature in equal quarterly
              installments  beginning  in 2003  and  ending  in  2005.  MediaOne
              prepaid  the  fixed  interest   payments   pursuant  to  the  swap
              agreements;  the costs of which were deferred and are amortized as
              adjustments to the interest  expense over the term of the debt. As
              a result of the swaps and related  amortization,  MediaOne expects
              to have a fixed  effective  interest rate of 5.91% on the MediaOne
              SPC IV debt and 6.02% on the MediaOne SPC VI debt. The unamortized
              prepaid  interest rate swap balance was  approximately  $475 as of
              June 30, 2000.

              LETTERS OF CREDIT
              At June 30, 2000,  we had letters of credit of $685.  The increase
              from December 31, 1999, was primarily related to letters of credit
              to support  subsidiary  debt as well as letters of credit MediaOne
              had entered into prior to the merger.

(h)           MINORITY INTEREST IN CENTAUR FUNDING CORPORATION
              Centaur Funding Corporation  (Centaur),  a subsidiary of MediaOne,
              issued  three   series  of   preferred   shares  prior  to  AT&T's
              acquisition  of  MediaOne.  Centaur was created for the  principal
              purpose of raising  capital  through  the  issuance  of  preferred
              shares and investing  those proceeds into notes issued by MediaOne
              SPC II, a subsidiary of MediaOne.  Principal and interest payments
              from the notes are  expected to be Centaur's  principal  source of
              funds to make  dividend and  redemption  payments on the preferred
              shares. In addition,  the dividend and certain redemption payments
              on the  preferred  shares will be  determined  by reference to the
              dividend  and  redemption  activity  of  the  preferred  stock  of
              AirTouch  Communications,  Inc.  (ATI Shares) held by MediaOne SPC
              II.  Payments on the preferred  shares are neither  guaranteed nor
              secured by MediaOne or AT&T.  The assets of MediaOne SPC II, which
              includes the ATI shares,  are only  available to pay the creditors
              of MediaOne SPC II.

              These  securities  remained  outstanding  at  June  30,  2000,  as
              follows:

                               Dividend Rate    Maturity Date    Carrying Amount

              Series A         Variable         None             $  100

              The Auction Market Preference Shares, Series A, have a liquidation
              value  of $250  thousand  per  share  and  dividends  are  payable
              quarterly  when  declared by Centaur's  Board of Directors  out of
              funds legally available.

              The  9.08%  Cumulative   Preference  Shares,   Series  B,  have  a
              liquidation  value of $1  thousand  per  share and  dividends  are
              payable  quarterly in arrears when declared by Centaur's  Board of
              Directors out of funds legally available.  In addition,  dividends
              may be declared  and paid only to the extent that  dividends  have
              been declared and paid on the ATI shares.

              The Preference  Shares,  Series C, have a liquidation  value of $1
              thousand per share at maturity.  The value of the Series C will be
              accreted  to  reach  its  liquidation  value  upon  maturity.  The
              preferred  shares issued by Centaur are recorded  within  Minority
              Interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

              TCI Securities:
              Prior  to  the   consummation  of  the  TCI  merger,   TCI  issued

              trusts  that  held  subordinated  debt  securities  of  TCI.  AT&T
              provides a full and  unconditional  guarantee  on the  outstanding

              MediaOne Securities:

              mandatorily   redeemable   exchangeable   notes  and   mandatorily
              redeemable  preferred  securities  through  subsidiary trusts that
              held subordinated debt securities of MediaOne.  Subsequent to June
              30,  2000,  AT&T  provided a full and  unconditional  guarantee on
              these outstanding securities issued by MediaOne. At June 30, 2000,

              guaranteed securities remained outstanding. Following is a summary
              of the  results  of  MediaOne  which  have  been  included  in the
              financial  results of AT&T since the date of  acquisition  on June

(j)           SEGMENT REPORTING
              AT&T's  results are  segmented  according to the way we manage our
              business:  Business Services, Consumer Services, Wireless Services
              and Broadband.  Our existing  segments reflect certain  managerial
              changes  since the  publication  of our 1999 annual  results.  All
              prior period  results have been restated to reflect these changes.
              In addition,  2000 results  reflect the  acquisition  of MediaOne,
              included in the Broadband segment, from the June 15, 2000, date of
              acquisition and the impact of assets and businesses contributed to
              Concert, which were included in 1999 results.

              Reflecting the dynamics of our business,  we  continuously  review
              our management model and structure, which may result in additional
              adjustments to our operating segments in the future.

(k)           NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
              In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
              issued SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and
              Hedging  Activities."  Among other  provisions,  it requires  that
              entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
              in  the   statement  of  financial   position  and  measure  those
              instruments at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes
              in the fair values of those  derivatives  would be  accounted  for
              depending  on the use of the  derivative  and whether it qualifies
              for hedge  accounting.  The  effective  date for this standard was
              delayed via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective  date for
              SFAS No.  133 is now for  fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,
              2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is  encouraged  and  retroactive
              application is prohibited.  For AT&T, this means that the standard
              must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001.

              In June  2000,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  138,  "Accounting  for
              Certain Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" as
              an   amendment   to  SFAS  No.  133.   This   statement   provides
              clarification with regard to certain  implementation  issues under
              SFAS  No.  133 on  specific  types  of  hedges.  We are  currently
              assessing  the impact of SFAS Nos. 133 and 138 on AT&T,  including
              an  assessment  of the  impact  resulting  from  our  merger  with
              MediaOne.

              In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  issued
              Staff  Accounting   Bulletin  No.  101  (SAB  No.  101),  "Revenue
              Recognition in Financial  Statements." The SEC delayed the date by
              which  registrants  must  apply  the  accounting  and  disclosures
              described in SAB No. 101 until the fourth  quarter of 2000. We are
              currently  assessing  the impact of SAB No. 101 on our  results of
              operations.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW
AT&T Corporation (AT&T) is among the world's communications  leaders,  providing
voice, data and video telecommunications services to large and small businesses,
consumers and government  agencies.  We provide domestic and international  long
distance, regional, local and wireless communications services, cable television
and Internet communications services. We also provide directory and calling-card
services to support our communications business.

On June 15, 2000, AT&T completed a merger with MediaOne Group,  Inc.  (MediaOne)
in a cash and stock  transaction  valued at  approximately  $56 billion.  In the
aggregate,  each share of MediaOne received 0.95 of a share of AT&T common stock
and $36.27 per share in cash,  consisting  of $30.85 per share as  stipulated in
the merger  agreement and $5.42 per share based on AT&T's stock price  preceding
the merger being below a predetermined  amount.  AT&T issued  approximately  606
million  shares of AT&T common  stock,  of which  approximately  60 million were
treasury  shares.  The merger with MediaOne was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting,  accordingly  the operating  results of MediaOne have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition.  The results of MediaOne are included within the Broadband segment.
Periods  prior to the  merger  were not  restated  to  include  the  results  of
MediaOne.

On April 27,  2000,  AT&T  completed an initial  public  offering of 360 million
shares of AT&T Wireless  Group tracking  stock.  This stock is designed to track
the economic  performance of AT&T's wireless services business and represented a
15.6% interest in that business.  AT&T retained the remaining  84.4% interest in
AT&T  Wireless  Group.  In  connection  with our first  quarter 1999 merger with
Tele-Communications, Inc., (TCI) renamed AT&T Broadband (Broadband), we issued a
separate  tracking  stock to reflect the economic  performance  of Liberty Media
Group  (LMG),   Broadband's   former   programming  and  technology   investment
businesses.  All other  businesses  of AT&T  comprise  AT&T Common  Stock Group,
including  AT&T's  retained  interest  in  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  the  economic
performance of which is represented by AT&T common stock.

The consolidated  results of AT&T include AT&T Wireless Group in its entirety on
a fully consolidated  basis. We do not have a controlling  financial interest in
Liberty Media Group for financial accounting purposes;  therefore, our ownership
in LMG is reflected as an  investment  accounted  for under the equity method in
the AT&T consolidated financial statements.

Earnings  attributable  to AT&T Wireless Group  represent  15.6% of the earnings
from April 27, 2000, the date of the initial public  offering,  through June 30,
2000. The remaining  earnings of AT&T's wireless  services business are included
in the earnings attributable to AT&T Common Stock Group. Similarly, the earnings
or losses related to LMG are excluded from the earnings available to AT&T Common
Stock Group.

Ownership of shares of AT&T common stock,  AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock or
Liberty Media Group tracking stock does not represent a direct legal interest in
the assets and  liabilities of any of these groups,  but an ownership of AT&T in
total. Each of these shares  represents an interest in the economic  performance
of each of these groups.

On January 5, 2000,  AT&T and  British  Telecommunications,  plc (BT)  announced
financial closure of Concert, their global communications joint venture. Concert
began  operations  as  a  leading  global  telecommunications  company,  serving
multinational  business customers,  international  carriers and Internet service
providers worldwide, providing them with voice, data and Internet services. AT&T
contributed all of its international  gateway-to-gateway assets and the economic
value of approximately 270 multinational  customers. In addition, we contributed
our international settlement business (revenue and expenses) to Concert. Results
for 2000 reflect the impact of these contributions.

The  discussion  and  analysis  that  follows  provides  information  management
believes is relevant to an assessment and  understanding of AT&T's  consolidated
results of operations  and cash flows for the three and six-month  periods ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, and financial condition as of June 30, 2000 and December
31, 1999.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Except  for  the  historical   statements  and  discussions   contained  herein,
statements herein constitute "forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and  Section  21E of the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934,  including   statements   concerning  future  operating
performance,  AT&T's  share  of new and  existing  markets,  AT&T's  short-  and
long-term  revenue and earnings growth rates,  and general industry growth rates
and AT&T's performance relative thereto.  These forward-looking  statements rely
on a number of assumptions concerning future events,  including the adoption and
implementation  of balanced and effective  rules and  regulations by the Federal
Communications  Commission (FCC) and the state public regulatory  agencies,  and
AT&T's ability to achieve a significant market penetration in new markets. These
forward-looking  statements are subject to a number of  uncertainties  and other
factors,  many of which are  outside  AT&T's  control  that could  cause  actual
results to differ materially from such statements.  AT&T disclaims any intention
or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking  statements,  whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Total revenue                       $16,221   $15,752    $32,122   $29,869

Revenue  increased 3.0% in the second quarter of 2000,  compared with the second
quarter  of  1999.  Revenue  for the  quarter  was  negatively  impacted  by the
formation of Concert, our global venture with BT, and positively impacted by the
acquisition  of  MediaOne.  Revenue  increased  7.5% in the first  half of 2000,
compared with the first half of 1999.  Revenue for the six months was positively
impacted by the acquisitions of TCI, the IBM Global Network (renamed AT&T Global
Network  Services,  or AGNS) and MediaOne,  and was  negatively  impacted by the
formation of Concert.  Normalized revenue, which adjusts for the acquisitions of
MediaOne,  TCI, adjusted for all closed cable  partnerships,  and AGNS,  various
divestments  of   international   businesses,   and  the  impact  of  businesses
contributed  to Concert,  increased 4.5% in the second quarter of 2000, and 5.2%
for the six months ended June 30, 2000,  compared with the respective periods in
1999.  These increases were led by Wireless  Services,  Business  Services,  and
Broadband, partially offset by declines in Consumer Services.

Effective July 1, 2000, the Federal  Communications  Commission (FCC) eliminated
the  per-line  charges  AT&T  pays  for  residential  and  single-line  business
customers.  Since AT&T bills its customers for these charges, the elimination of
the charge will negatively impact revenue in the second half of 2000,  primarily
in the Consumer Services business.

companies   to  connect   calls  made  to   foreign   countries   (international
settlements). As result of the commencement of operations of Concert, all of our
international  settlements  are  incurred by Concert.  In  addition,  all of our
foreign billed  revenue is now earned by Concert.  The amount charged by Concert
in 2000 is lower  than  interconnection  expense  incurred  in 1999,  since AT&T
recorded these transactions within revenue and expense,  as applicable.  Concert
bills us a net expense comprised of international  settlement  (interconnection)
expense and foreign billed revenue.  Partially offsetting the decline were costs
incurred related to Concert products that AT&T now sells to its customers.

Also partially  offsetting the decrease were higher access and other  connection
expenses  associated with  connecting  domestic calls on the facilities of other
service providers.  These costs rose primarily due to increased per-line charges
(Primary  Interexchange  Carrier Charges),  Universal Service Fund contributions
and local connectivity charges as well as volume increases,  partially offset by
mandated reductions in per-minute access costs, more efficient network usage and
the sale of ACC International.

Effective  July  1,  2000,  per-line  charges  AT&T  pays  for  residential  and
single-line business customers were eliminated by the FCC.  Accordingly,  access
and other connection charges will decrease in the second half of 2000.

Costs of services and products       $4,116    $3,835     $8,031    $6,728

Costs of services and  products  increased  7.3% in the second  quarter of 2000,
compared with the second quarter of 1999, and was impacted by our acquisition of
MediaOne and the formation of Concert in 2000,  as well as our 1999  acquisition
of AGNS.  Excluding  these  items,  costs of  services  and  products  increased
slightly due to higher costs  associated  with our growing  wireless  subscriber
base and  wireless  network  as well as  increased  costs to  support  growth in
outsourcing  contracts.  Also contributing to the increase were higher Broadband
programming  costs  principally  due to rate  increases.  These  increases  were
partially offset by continued cost control initiatives.

Costs of  services  and  products  increased  19.4% in the  first  half of 2000,
compared with the first half of 1999,  largely due to our  acquisitions  of TCI,
MediaOne,  and AGNS, partially offset by the impact of Concert.  Excluding these
items,  costs of services  and products  increased  slightly due to higher costs
associated with our growing  wireless  subscriber base and wireless  network and
increased costs to support growth in outsourcing contracts. These increases were
partially  offset  by  cost  control  initiatives  and  a  lower  provision  for
uncollectible receivables in Consumer and Business Services.

Selling,  general and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  decreased  10.1% in the
second quarter of 2000,  compared with the second quarter of 1999.  Increases to
second  quarter  2000  SG&A  expenses  as a  result  of the  MediaOne  and  AGNS
acquisitions were essentially  offset by the impact of the formation of Concert.
The  decrease  was  primarily  the result of cost  control  initiatives  such as
headcount reductions, and a larger pension credit in 2000, primarily driven by a
higher pension trust asset base resulting  from  increased  investment  returns.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with
our growing wireless subscriber base.

One  acquisitions as well as the formation of Concert,  SG&A expenses  decreased
approximately  6%, compared with the first six months of 1999. This decrease was
primarily  the  result  of  cost  control   initiatives,   including   headcount
reductions,  and a larger pension credit in 2000,  primarily  driven by a higher
pension trust asset base  resulting  from increased  investment  returns.  These
decreases were partially  offset by an increase in expenses  associated with our
growing wireless subscriber base and our other growth businesses.

Depreciation  and  other  amortization  expenses  increased  9.8% in the  second
quarter of 2000,  compared with the second quarter of 1999.  Increases to second
quarter 2000  depreciation  and other  amortization  expenses as a result of the
MediaOne  and AGNS  acquisitions  were  essentially  offset by the impact of the
formation of Concert.  For the first six months of 2000,  depreciation and other

1999. Excluding the impact of the TCI, AGNS and MediaOne acquisitions as well as
the formation of Concert, depreciation and other amortization expenses increased
approximately  10% for the six months  ended June 30,  2000.  These  quarter and
year-to-date  increases were due to the increased  asset base resulting from the
continued infrastructure investment.  Capital expenditures were $3.6 billion for
the quarter ended June 30, 2000, bringing  year-to-date  capital expenditures to
$6.5 billion.  We continue to focus the vast majority of our capital spending on

Amortization  of goodwill,  franchise  costs,  and other  purchased  intangibles
increased 15.6% in the second quarter of 2000,  compared with the second quarter
of 1999. The increase was largely  attributable  to the  acquisitions of AGNS in

amortization  of  goodwill,  franchise  costs  and other  purchased  intangibles
increased 44.2% compared with the first six months of 1999, largely attributable
to the acquisitions of TCI and AGNS in 1999 and MediaOne in 2000.

AT&T  also  has  amortization  of  goodwill   associated  with   nonconsolidated

During the second  quarter of 2000,  no  restructuring  and other  charges  were
recorded.  For the  second  quarter  of 1999,  such  charges  netted to a pretax
benefit of $29  million.  The  benefit  included a $68  million  pretax net gain
primarily related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would have competed
directly  with Concert.  Also  included was an $11 million  pretax gain from the
settlement of pension  obligations  from AT&T's voluntary  retirement  incentive
program offer.  Partially offsetting these gains was a $50 million pretax charge
related to a contribution agreement entered into by Broadband to satisfy certain
liabilities of Phoenixstar, Inc. (formerly Primestar, Inc.).

Net  restructuring  and other  charges for the six months  ended June 30,  2000,
totaled  $773  million,  which had an  approximate  $0.14 impact on earnings per
diluted share. The charge included  restructuring and exit costs of $682 million
relating to actions  across many of our business  units and  includes  severance
costs associated with about 6,200 employees. These actions were primarily driven
by the company's continuing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs by
$2 billion by the end of the year.  Also  recorded in the six months  ended June
30, 2000, was a $91 million  charge related to the mandated  disposition of AT&T
Communications (U.K.) Ltd. (Comms U.K.), which would have competed directly with
Concert.

In the first half of 2000,  we also  recorded  $62 million of network  lease and
other contract  termination costs associated with penalties  incurred as part of
notifying   vendors  of  the  termination  of  these  contracts.   Additionally,
restructuring and exit costs included $144 million of benefit  curtailment costs
associated  with  employee  separations  as part of these  exit  plans.  We also
recorded an $18 million asset  impairment  charge  related to the  write-down of
unrecoverable  assets in certain  businesses  in which the carrying  value is no
longer supported by future cash flows.

As a result of our merger with  MediaOne and as part of our objective to benefit
from the synergies  created by this merger,  we will record further  charges for
exit and separation plans in the second half of the year.

Net  restructuring  and other  charges for the six months  ended June 30,  1999,
totaled  $702  million,  which had an  approximate  $0.22 impact on earnings per
diluted share. The charge included a pretax in-process  research and development
charge of $594 million related to the TCI acquisition, a $128 million pretax net
charge  primarily  related to the exit of certain joint ventures that would have
competed  directly with Concert and a $50 million  pretax charge  related to the
Phoenixstar  agreement noted above. These charges were partially offset by a $70
million pretax gain related to the settlement of pension  obligations for former
employees who accepted AT&T's voluntary retirement incentive program offer.

The $594  million  in-process  research and  development  charge  reflected  the
estimated fair value of research and development projects at TCI, as of the date
of the acquisition,  which had not yet reached technological feasibility or that
had no  alternative  future  use.  Although  there are  technological  issues to
overcome  to  successfully   complete  the  acquired  in  process  research  and
development,  we believe we are on track for successful completion. The projects
identified  related to  efforts to offer  voice  over  Internet  Protocol  (IP),
product-integration  efforts for advanced set-top devices,  cost-savings efforts
for cable  telephony  implementation  and  in-process  research and  development
related to At Home  Corporation  (Excite@Home).  We expect to test IP  telephony
equipment  for field  deployment,  begin  field  trials  related to our  product
integration efforts for set-top devices,  and test and deploy devices related to
our telephony cost reductions by the end of 2000.

Equity earnings from Liberty Media Group were $267 million in the second quarter
of 2000,  compared  with losses of $543  million in the  year-ago  quarter.  The
increase was primarily due to a gain associated with the acquisition of Flextech
p.l.c.  (Flextech) by Telewest  Communications  plc  (Telewest)  reflecting  the
difference between the carrying value of LMG's interest in Flextech and the fair
value of the Telewest  securities  received in the merger.  Equity earnings from

losses of $601  million in 1999.  In  addition to the gain  associated  with the
Flextech acquisition, the increase in earnings for the six months ended June 30,
2000,  was also impacted by a gain  associated  with the  acquisition of General
Instrument  Corporation  (General  Instrument)  by  Motorola,   Inc.  (Motorola)
reflecting  the  difference  between  the  carrying  value of LMG's  interest in

entity  owning  certain  cable  systems  and other  assets  for AT&T  stock (Cox
transaction),  which was  tax-free,  and the  benefit  of the  write-off  of the

2000, as a result of margin improvements, and higher other income. The increases
were partially  offset by the second quarter 1999 benefit of a change in the net
operating loss utilization tax rules.

As reported,  diluted EPS  attributable to AT&T Common Stock Group grew 21.6% to
$1.07 in the six months ended June 30, 2000,  compared with the six months ended
June 30, 1999. The increase was primarily due to improved  operating  income,  a
lower  provision  for taxes and higher other  income.  These  improvements  were
partially  offset by higher  average shares  outstanding in 2000  reflecting the
impact of shares issued for the TCI and MediaOne acquisitions.

Included in EPS for the second quarter are the following items:
 ..Losses of $0.05 in the second  quarter of 2000 and $0.04 in the second quarter
  of 1999  reflecting the earnings  impact of our investments in Excite@Home and
  Cablevision.
 ..Net gains on  sales and other of $0.01 in the second quarter of 2000 and $0.02
  in the second quarter of 1999;
 ..A $0.02  benefit in the second  quarter of 1999 from changes in tax rules with
  respect to the utilization of acquired net operating losses.

Included  in EPS for the first  half of 2000 and 1999 are the  following  items:
 ..Net  restructuring  and other charges of  $0.14 in the first  half of 2000 and
  $0.22 in the first half of 1999;
 ..Losses of  $0.12 in the first half of 2000 and $0.06 in the first half of 1999
  reflecting  the  earnings  impact  of  our  investments  in  Excite@Home   and
  Cablevision;
 ..Net gains on sales and  other of $0.23 in the first  half of 2000 and $0.05 in
  the first half of 1999.
 ..A $0.02  benefit in the second  quarter of 1999 from changes in tax rules with
  respect to the utilization of acquired net operating losses.

The total  impact of the these  items was a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.04 and
$0.03 for the second quarter and first half of 2000,  respectively.  These items
had no  impact to  diluted  EPS for the  second  quarter  of 1999 and  decreased
diluted EPS by $0.21 for the first half of 1999.  We quantify  the impact on our
results of our investments in Excite@Home and Cablevision since these businesses
have financial  information publicly available and their results can be reviewed
independently of AT&T's results.

EPS excluding  these items was $0.57 per diluted share in the second  quarter of
2000, an increase of 16.4%,  or $0.08,  over the comparable  prior year quarter.
EPS  excluding  these items was $1.10 per diluted share for the six months ended
June 30, 2000, compared with $1.09 for the same period in 1999.

EPS for Liberty  Media Group was $0.10 per share for the three months ended June
30,  2000,  compared  with a loss of $0.21 per share for the three  months ended
June 30, 1999.  The increase in EPS for the second quarter of 2000, is primarily
due to a gain associated with the acquisition of Flextech by Telewest reflecting
the difference  between the carrying value of LMG's interest in Flextech and the
fair value of the Telewest  securities  received in the merger.  EPS for Liberty
Media Group was $0.47 per share for the first half of 2000, compared with a loss
of $0.24 per share in 1999. The first half of 2000 results include six months of
Liberty Media Group results  compared with four months in 1999,  reflecting  the
March 1999  acquisition of TCI by AT&T. In addition to the gain  associated with
the Flextech acquisition,  the increase in EPS for the six months ended June 30,
2000,  was also impacted by a gain  associated  with the  acquisition of General
Instrument  Corporation  (General  Instrument)  by  Motorola,   Inc.  (Motorola)
reflecting  the  difference  between  the  carrying  value of LMG's  interest in
General Instrument and the fair value of the Motorola securities received in the
merger.

SEGMENT RESULTS

In support of the  services we provide,  we segment our results by the  business
units that support our primary lines of business:  Business  Services,  Consumer
Services,  Wireless  Services and  Broadband.  A fifth  category,  Corporate and
Other,  includes  corporate staff  functions,  the elimination of  inter-segment
business  as well as the  results  of  international  operations  and  ventures.
Although not a segment, we also discuss the results of LMG.

The discussion of segment results includes  revenue;  earnings,  including other
income,  before  interest and taxes (EBIT);  earnings,  including  other income,
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and  amortization,  and minority interest
(EBITDA);  total assets;  and capital  additions.  The  discussion of EBITDA for
Wireless  Services and  Broadband  is modified to exclude  other  income.  Total
assets for each segment  include all assets,  except  intercompany  receivables.
Prepaid pension assets and  corporate-owned  or leased real estate are generally

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

held at the  corporate  level and  therefore  are included in the  Corporate and
Other group. Shared network assets are allocated to the segments and reallocated
each January, based on two years of volumes.  Capital additions for each segment
include capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment,  acquisitions of
licenses, additions to nonconsolidated investments, increases in franchise costs
and additions to internal-use software.

EBIT is the primary  measure used by AT&T's chief  operating  decision makers to
measure  AT&T's  operating  results  and to measure  segment  profitability  and
performance.  AT&T  calculates  EBIT as operating  income plus other income.  In
addition,  management also uses EBITDA as a measure of segment profitability and
performance,  and is  defined as EBIT plus  depreciation  and  amortization  and
minority  interest.  Interest and taxes are not factored into the  profitability
measure used by the chief operating decision makers; therefore, trends for these
items  are  discussed  on a  consolidated  basis.  Management  believes  EBIT is
meaningful to investors  because it is used by AT&T's chief  operating  decision
makers  and  provides a measure  of return on total  capitalization.  We believe
EBITDA is meaningful to investors as a measure of each  segment's  liquidity and
is utilized by our chief operating decision makers. In addition, we believe that
both EBIT and EBITDA allow  investors a means to evaluate the financial  results
of each segment in relation to AT&T.  Our  calculation of EBIT and EBITDA may or
may not be consistent  with the  calculation  of these  measures by other public
companies.  EBIT and EBITDA should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
to  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  measures of income as a
measure of performance or to cash flows from operating,  investing and financing
activities  as a measure of  liquidity.  In addition,  EBITDA does not take into
account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flow.

Our existing segments reflect certain  managerial  changes since the publication
of our 1999 annual  results.  All prior  period  results  have been  restated to
reflect these changes.

To provide comparability,  we normalize revenue to reflect the impact of certain
1999 and 2000  transactions.  For  example,  when we normalize  for Concert,  we
remove the revenue associated with  businesses/customers  contributed to Concert
from  1999  results.  The  acquisitions  of  TCI,  AGNS,  MediaOne  and  certain
international  divestments are normalized as if those  acquisitions/dispositions
occurred  January 1, 1999.  Finally,  certain  2000  Broadband  cable  swaps are
normalized in 1999 results as if those swaps happened on the corresponding  date
in 1999.

BUSINESS SERVICES
Our Business Services segment offers a variety of global communications services
including long distance, local and data and Internet Protocol (IP) networking to
small and medium-sized  businesses,  large domestic and multinational businesses
and government agencies. Business Services is also a provider of voice, data and
IP transport to service resellers  (wholesale  services).  Also included in this
segment is AT&T  Solutions,  which is composed of the Solutions  outsourcing and
network  management  business unit and the internal AT&T Information  Technology
Services unit.

REVENUE
Business Services revenue increased $383 million, or 5.7%, in the second quarter
of 2000,  and increased  $1,071  million,  or 8.1%,  for the first six months of
2000, compared with the prior year.  Normalized for the 1999 acquisition of AGNS
and the impact of Concert,  revenue  increased 4.0% and 5.0% for the quarter and
year-to-date  periods,  respectively.  The  increases  for both the  quarter and
year-to-date  periods were driven primarily by growth in data/IP and outsourcing
services, partially offset by a decline in voice services.

Normalized  data/IP  services  revenue  grew at a  mid-teens  rate  for both the
quarter and year-to-date  periods led by continued growth in frame relay, IP and
high-speed  private line  services.  IP services,  which  include AT&T  WorldNet
services and Virtual Private Network Services (VPN), grew  approximately 50% for
both the three and  six-month  periods ended June 30, 2000, as compared with the
same periods in 1999. On a combined basis,  packet  services  (frame relay,  ATM
(Asynchronous  Transfer Mode) and IP) grew nearly 50% for the quarter and nearly
45% for the first half of 2000, compared with the same periods in 1999.

AT&T Solutions outsourcing revenue, normalized for the acquisition of AGNS, grew
23.2% in the second  quarter of 2000, and grew 23.9% for the first six months of
2000,  compared with the same periods in the prior year.  These  increases  were
primarily  due to growth from new  contract  signings and add-on  business  from
existing clients. During the quarter, AT&T Solutions signed four new outsourcing
deals with an aggregate  contract value of  approximately  $600 million over the
life of the contract.

Voice revenue,  normalized  for the impact of Concert and the AGNS  acquisition,
was down  slightly  for both the quarter and  year-to-date  periods,  as pricing
declines outpaced  increases in volumes,  which grew at a low-teens rate for the
quarter and a mid-teens rate for the year.  Business  services revenue continues
to shift to higher growth products such as data/IP and outsourcing, resulting in
a decline in long distance voice revenue as a percent of total revenue.  Revenue
associated with 800 business,  for example,  is shifting from voice to IP as the
e-business industry expands.

As a component of voice revenue,  local revenue grew  approximately  20% and 25%
for the quarter  and  year-to-date  periods,  respectively.  Revenue  growth was
negatively  impacted,  in both the  quarter  and  year-to-date  periods,  by the
settlement of public utility  commission  rulings.  AT&T's  integrated  business

local  operations added 300 thousand access lines in the second quarter bringing
total access lines in service as of June 30, 2000, to almost 2.0 million. During
the quarter, we refined the way we count access lines to more accurately reflect
the total number of lines carrying local AT&T Digital Link traffic  through 4ESS
switches.  On-net buildings totaled 5,913 at June 30, 2000, a 4.7% increase over
June 30, 1999.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT  increased  $177  million,  or 12.4%,  in the second  quarter of 2000,  and
increased  $110 million,  or 3.6%, in the first half of 2000,  compared with the
same prior year periods.  EBITDA increased $277 million, or 12.2%, in the second
quarter of 2000, and increased $329 million, or 7.2%, in the first half of 2000,
compared  with the same prior  year  periods.  Excluding  a first  quarter  2000
restructuring  charge of $93 million,  EBIT increased 6.7% and EBITDA  increased
9.2% in the first half of 2000,  compared  with the same  periods  of 1999.  The
quarterly  and  year-to-date  increases  were  primarily  due to revenue  growth
combined with continued cost  reductions,  partially offset by the impact of the
customers  contributed to Concert. The earnings impact of our equity interest in
Concert is reported within Corporate and Other.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  decreased $277 million,  or 16.6%,  to $1,392 million in the
second  quarter of 2000 compared with the second  quarter of 1999.  The decrease
was primarily  driven by reduced capital  expenditures on plant,  property,  and
equipment  associated with long distance voice services.  However, for the first
half of 2000,  capital  additions  increased  $71  million,  or 2.7%,  to $2,652
million  compared with the first half of 1999. The increase was primarily driven
by additions to plant, property and equipment for our local network and AGNS.

Total assets  increased  $559 million,  or 1.7%, to $32,569  million at June 30,
2000,  compared with December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily  driven by an
increase  in  accounts  receivable  due to  higher  revenue  in our  outsourcing
business and timing of cash  receipts.  In  addition,  increases in internal use
software  contributed to the increase in assets.  These increases were partially
offset  by a  decrease  in plant,  property,  and  equipment  as a result of the
contribution  of assets to Concert  combined with  depreciation  for the period,
offset in part by capital expenditures.

CONSUMER SERVICES
Our Consumer Services segment provides a variety of any-distance  communications
services  including  long  distance,  local toll  (intrastate  calls outside the
immediate local area) and Internet access to residential customers. In addition,
Consumer Services provides transaction services such as prepaid calling-card and
operator-handled  calling  services.  Local  phone  service is also  provided in
certain areas.

REVENUE

Consumer  Services  revenue  decreased  9.0% in the second  quarter of 2000, and
declined  8.3% for the first  half of 2000,  compared  with the same  periods in
1999. Normalized for the impact of Concert, revenue decreased 7.2% in the second
quarter  and  declined  6.4% for the  first  half of the  year as long  distance
calling volumes  continued to decline at a high  single-digit  rate during these
periods.  These results reflect the ongoing  competitive  nature of the consumer
long distance  industry,  which has resulted in pricing  pressures and a loss of
market share.  Also negatively  impacting  revenue was product  substitution and
market migration away from direct dial wireline and calling card services to the
rapidly  growing  wireless  services.  We  expect  competition  to  continue  to
negatively impact Consumer Services revenue.  Also,  revenue growth for Consumer
Services will be negatively impacted by the elimination of per-line charges that
AT&T pays for  residential  customers  since  AT&T  bills  these  charges to its
customers.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT was up 0.5%  and  EBITDA  was  down  2.0% in the  second  quarter  of 2000,
compared  with the same  period of 1999.  For the first  half of the year,  EBIT
decreased 3.3% and EBITDA decreased 5.3%, compared with the same period in 1999.
EBIT and EBITDA  continue to be  negatively  impacted by the decline in revenue,
however reflecting our cost control initiatives, EBIT and EBITA margins continue
to  improve.  The EBIT  margin was 37.1% and the EBITDA  margin was 39.9% in the
second  quarter  of 2000,  compared  with an EBIT  margin of 33.6% and an EBITDA
margin  of 37.0%  for the same  period in 1999.  EBIT and  EBITDA  include a $96
million  restructuring  charge  for the first half of 2000,  and  include a $153
million  gain on the sale of Language  Line  Services in the first half of 1999.
Excluding these items,  the EBIT and EBITDA margins improved to 36.5% and 39.4%,
respectively,  for the  first  half of 2000,  compared  with  32.3%  and  35.8%,
respectively,  for the same period in 1999,  due  primarily  to our cost control
initiatives.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital additions  declined $46 million,  or 38.4%, to $74 million in the second
quarter of 2000, compared with the second quarter of 1999. For the first half of
2000, capital additions decreased $80 million, or 38.3%, compared with the first
half of 1999.  These  decreases  were  primarily  attributable  to lower capital
expenditures   associated   with  our  consumer  long   distance   business  and
internal-use software.

Total assets  decreased  $978 million,  or 15.6%,  to $5,301 million at June 30,
2000, compared with December 31, 1999,  primarily due to a decrease in property,
plant  and  equipment  as a result  of the  contribution  of  certain  assets to
Concert,  coupled  with  depreciation  expense  during the period.  In addition,
accounts receivable declined as a result of lower revenue.

WIRELESS SERVICES
Our  Wireless  Services  segment  offers  wireless  voice and data  services and
products  to  customers  in our 850  megahertz  (cellular)  and  1900  megahertz
(Personal  Communications  Services,  or PCS)  markets.  Wireless  Services also
includes certain  interests in partnerships and affiliates that provide wireless
services  in the United  States  and  internationally,  aviation  communications
services, and fixed wireless. Fixed wireless provides high-speed Internet access
and  any-distance  voice services using wireless  technology to residential  and
small business customers.

REVENUE
Wireless Services revenue increased $599 million, or 31.9%, to $2,477 million in
the second quarter of 2000,  compared with the first quarter of 1999,  including
growth in services revenue of 32.7% to $2,240 million.  Revenue increased $1,235
million,  or 35.9%,  to $4,675 million in the first half of 2000,  compared with
the first half of 1999,  including growth in services revenue of 38.3% to $4,232
million.  Total  revenue grew 29.4% for the quarter and 31.1% for the first half
of the year,  adjusted to exclude Vanguard  Cellular  Systems,  Inc., for months
prior  to May  2000  to  correlate  results  with  1999,  due to  the  May  1999
acquisition of Vanguard.  The growth reflects the continued successful execution
of AT&T's  wireless  strategy  of  targeting  and  retaining  specific  customer
segments,  expanding  the  national  wireless  footprint,  focusing  on  digital
service,  and  offering  simple rate plans.  This has resulted in an increase in
consolidated  subscribers  and an increase in average  monthly  revenue per user
(ARPU).  Equipment  revenue grew 25.2% to $237 million in the second  quarter of
2000,  and grew 16.6% to $443 million for the first half of 2000,  compared with
the respective prior year periods.

AT&T continues to experience strong growth in wireless subscribers. Consolidated
subscribers  grew to 11.7 million at June 30, 2000,  representing an increase of
33.8%  over  the  prior  year  quarter,   including  approximately  1.2  million
subscribers associated with the completed acquisitions of our remaining interest
in CMT Partners (which owned wireless  properties in the San Francisco Bay area)

and Wireless One Network, L.P. (which owned wireless properties in northwest and
southwest Florida). Net consolidated wireless subscriber additions in the second
quarter  totaled  532,000,  a 14.2% increase over the prior year quarter.  Total
subscribers,  including  partnership  markets  in  which  AT&T  does  not  own a
controlling interest, were nearly 14 million at the end of the second quarter, a
22.3% increase over the prior year quarter. This includes  approximately 450,000
subscribers  associated  with the  acquisition of American  Cellular in February
2000.  AT&T's average monthly churn rate in the second quarter of 2000, was 2.7%
compared with 2.3% in the second  quarter of 1999, and 2.9% in the first quarter
of  2000.  AT&T's  average  monthly  churn  in the  first  half of 2000 was 2.8%
compared with 2.5% in the first half of 1999.

EBIT/EBITDA EXCLUDING OTHER INCOME
EBIT increased $210 million, or 166.2%, to $335 million in the second quarter of
2000,  and increased $372 million to $446 million in the first half of the year,
compared  with the same prior year  periods.  The  increases  were impacted by a
second  quarter 2000 gain of $95 million on the sale of  Celumovil  and a second
quarter 1999 gain of $88 million on the sale of WOOD-TV.  Excluding these gains,
EBIT  improved  $203 million to $240  million for the quarter and improved  $365
million to $351 million for the first half of the year. The improvement for both
periods  was  primarily  the result of revenue  growth and  expense  leveraging,
primarily  off-network  roaming expenses,  as well as higher other income due to
interest income on the initial public offering  proceeds  attributed to Wireless
Group.  The reduction in  off-network  expenses  reflects  continued  efforts to
migrate more minutes onto AT&T's  wireless  network,  as well as  reductions  in
intercarrier  roaming rates.  These were partially offset by increased  customer
acquisition  and customer care costs, as well as higher  information  technology
costs associated with growth in the subscriber base.

EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  increased  $187 million,  or 58.5%,  to $508
million in the second quarter of 2000, and increased $404 million,  or 80.1%, to
$909 million for the first six months of the year,  compared with the same prior
year periods.  The improvement  for both periods was primarily  driven by higher
revenue and an improving cost structure.

OTHER ITEMS
In the second  quarter of 2000,  capital  additions  increased  $694  million to
$1,364 million  compared with the same quarter of 1999. For the first six months
of 2000,  capital additions  increased $1,894 million to $2,754 million compared
with the first six months of 1999.  These  increases  were  primarily  driven by
capital  expenditure on capacity  upgrades and  improvements to network quality.
Also  contributing  to the increase in capital  additions was our  investment in
American Cellular in the first quarter of 2000.

Total assets increased $5,470 million,  or 23.5%, to $28,782 million at June 30,
2000,  compared  with  December 31, 1999.  The increase was primarily due to the
acquisition  of our remaining  interest in CMT Partners and our  acquisition  of
Wireless  One Network,  L.P.,  which  resulted in increases to licensing  costs,
goodwill,  property,  plant and  equipment and other  assets.  In addition,  the
increase  in  property,  plant and  equipment  was also the  result  of  capital
expenditures in support of the continued expansion and build out of our wireless
network, partially offset by depreciation expense for the period.

BROADBAND
Our Broadband  segment offers a variety of services  through our cable broadband
network,  including  traditional  analog video and new services  such as digital
video service, high-speed data service and telephony service.

The results for Broadband include MediaOne since June 15, 2000.  Therefore,  the
three months and six months ended June 30, 2000,  include 2 weeks of  operations
for MediaOne,  while the comparable  periods for 1999 do not include any results
of MediaOne.  In addition,  the first half of 2000 includes a full six months of
TCI  results,  while the first  half of 1999  includes  only four  months of TCI
results reflecting the March 1999 acquisition.

REVENUE
Broadband's  revenue increased $237 million, or 15.9%, for the second quarter of
2000, and increased $1,290 million,  or 65.0%, for the six months ended June 30,
2000,  compared with the same periods of last year.  The increase in revenue was
primarily  due  to  the  inclusion  of  MediaOne   results  since  the  date  of
acquisition,  a basic cable rate  increase,  higher  revenue  from new  services
(digital video,  high-speed data and telephony) and higher advertising  revenue.
These increases were partially offset by the impact of net dispositions of cable
properties.  In addition,  revenue for the six months  ended June 30, 2000,  was
impacted by the acquisition of TCI in March of 1999. Revenue, normalized for the
MediaOne  acquisition and adjusted for the net disposition of cable  properties,
increased  10.5% in the second  quarter of 2000 compared with the second quarter
of 1999.  Revenue for the first half of 2000, on this same basis and  normalized
for the TCI  acquisition,  increased  9.4%  compared  with the same  prior  year
period.

Broadband  ended  the  second  quarter  of 2000 with 16.1  million  basic  cable
customers,  passing  approximately  27.9  million  homes,  more than 2.2 million
digital-video  customers,  approximately 689,000 high-speed data customers,  and
provided telephony service to nearly 224,000 customers.

EBIT/EBITDA EXCLUDING OTHER INCOME
EBIT was a deficit of $542 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2000, compared
with a deficit of $526 million in 1999.  Excluding  the impact of our  ownership
interest in Cablevision and Excite@Home in both periods,  certain gains in 2000,
and  restructuring  and other  charges in 1999,  EBIT for the second  quarter of
2000, was a deficit of $194 million, a 16.5% improvement over the same period of
1999. This increase was due to higher revenue,  lower stock appreciation  rights
expense and increased  gains on sales of businesses and  investments,  partially
offset by higher expenses associated with high-speed data and telephony services
as well as increased programming and depreciation  expenses.  In addition,  EBIT
was  negatively  impacted by  MediaOne.  EBIT for the six months  ended June 30,
2000, was a deficit of $553 million compared with a deficit of $1,187 million in
1999.  Excluding  the  impact  of our  ownership  interest  in  Cablevision  and

Excite@Home in both periods,  certain gains in 2000 and  restructuring and other
charges in 2000 and 1999,  EBIT was a deficit of $273 million for the first half
of 2000,  compared  with a deficit of $224 million for the first half 1999.  The
decrease  was  due to  higher  expenses  associated  with  high-speed  data  and
telephony services as well as increased  programming and depreciation  expenses.
Offsetting  these  decreases to EBIT was higher  revenue and increased  gains on
sales of businesses and investments.

EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  for the second  quarter was $389 million,  an
increase of 46.6%  compared with the second quarter of 1999.  EBITDA,  excluding
other income,  for the six months ended June 30, 2000, was $739 million compared
with a deficit of $126 million for the same period of 1999.  Excluding  the 2000
and 1999  restructuring  and other  charges,  EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,
increased  23.4% in the second quarter of 2000, and increased 45.1% in the first
half of 2000.  These  increases are due to higher  revenue and the impact of the
MediaOne  acquisition,  partially  offset by  higher  expenses  associated  with
high-speed data and telephony  services as well as increased  programming costs.
In addition,  EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  was  favorably  impacted in the
second quarter and first half of 2000 by lower stock appreciation rights expense
and by the inclusion of a full six months of TCI, respectively.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital  additions  were $986 million in the second  quarter of 2000, and $2,330
million for the six months ended June 30, 2000,  comprised  primarily of capital
expenditures  directed towards the launch of new services as well as spending on
the upgrade of cable plants.  Capital  additions also included  contributions to
various  nonconsolidated   investments.  The  significant  increase  in  capital
additions in the first half of 2000,  compared with 1999, reflects the timing of
the TCI acquisition in March of 1999.

Total  assets were  $123,091  million at June 30,  2000,  compared  with $56,536
million at December 31, 1999.  The increase is due to the MediaOne  acquisition,
partially offset by decreased investments and franchise costs as a result of the
exchange of certain cable systems and other assets with Cox for AT&T stock,  and
the disposition of our investment in Lenfest.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

REVENUE
Revenue  for  Corporate  and  Other   primarily   includes  the  elimination  of
inter-segment  revenue of  negative  $185  million (a  decrease  of $11  million
compared  with  second  quarter  of 1999)  and  revenue  from our  international
operations and ventures of $70 million (a decline of $264 million  compared with
the second quarter of 1999). The  international  operations and ventures revenue
decrease  was largely due to the revenue  impact of  businesses  contributed  to
Concert  and due to lower  revenue  associated  with the  divestment  of certain
international  businesses.  Corporate  and  Other  revenue,  normalized  for the
divestments of international businesses and for the impact of Concert, increased
7.4% in the second quarter of 2000, compared with the second quarter of 1999.

For the first half of 2000,  revenue for Corporate and Other primarily  included
the elimination of inter-segment revenue of negative $363 million (a decrease of
$2  million  compared  with  the  first  half of  1999)  and  revenue  from  our
international operations and ventures of $184 million (a decline of $440 million
compared with the first half of 1999). The international operations and ventures
revenue  decrease  was largely due to the impact of  businesses  contributed  to
Concert  and due to lower  revenue  associated  with the  divestment  of certain
international  businesses.  Corporate  and  Other  revenue,  normalized  for the
divestments of international businesses and for the impact of Concert, increased
13.1% in the first half of 2000, compared with the first half of 1999.

EBIT/EBITDA
EBIT for  Corporate  and Other  increased  $132  million to $129  million in the
second  quarter of 2000,  compared with the second  quarter of 1999.  EBITDA for
Corporate and Other increased $149 million to $248 million in the second quarter
of 2000 compared with the second  quarter of 1999.  The increases were primarily
due to a larger  pension  credit in 2000  primarily  driven by a higher  pension
trust asset base resulting from increased  investment  returns,  higher interest
income in 2000 and $31 million of earnings from our equity  interest in Concert.
These   increases  were  partially   offset  by  the  second  quarter  1999  net
restructuring  and other  charge  benefits.  In  addition,  EBIT was  negatively
impacted by increased distributions on trust preferred securities.

EBIT for Corporate  and Other  declined $60 million to a deficit of $517 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2000,  compared with the six months ended June
30, 1999.  EBITDA for Corporate  and Other  improved $19 million to a deficit of
$247  million  for the six months  ended June 30,  2000,  compared  with the six
months  ended June 30, 1999.  Excluding  net  restructuring  charges in 2000 and
1999,  EBIT  increased  $450  million to $51 million and EBITDA  increased  $529
million to $321 million.  The  improvement was primarily due to a larger pension
credit in 2000  primarily  driven by a higher pension trust asset base resulting
from increased  investment returns,  higher interest income in 2000, earnings of
$66 million from our equity  interest in Concert,  cost control  initiatives and
gains in 2000 on the sale of miscellaneous investments.  These improvements were
partially offset by distributions on trust preferred securities.

OTHER ITEMS
Capital additions for corporate and other declined $44 million, or 33.4%, to $87
million,  in the second quarter of 2000, compared with the same quarter of 1999.
For the first six months of 2000,  capital additions  declined $274 million,  or
58.8%, to $192 million  compared with the first six months of 1999. This decline
reflects  decreased  investment in  international  nonconsolidated  subsidiaries
primarily as a result of the  disposition of certain  non-strategic  investments
during 1999.

Total assets  increased $1,717 million during the first half of 2000, to $14,526
million  primarily  due to our  investment  in  Concert,  including  the  assets
contributed by Business Services and Consumer Services.

LIBERTY MEDIA GROUP RESULTS
Liberty  Media Group (LMG)  produces,  acquires and  distributes  entertainment,
educational and informational programming services through all available formats
and  media.  LMG is  also  engaged  in  electronic  retailing  services,  direct
marketing  services,   advertising  sales  relating  to  programming   services,
infomercials and transaction  processing.  Equity earnings (losses) from Liberty
Media Group were $267 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000, and were
$(543) million in the comparable 1999 period.  Equity earnings (losses) from LMG
were $1,209 million for the first half of 2000, compared with $(601) million for
the period from the date of acquisition  through June 30, 1999.  These increases
are primarily due to gains associated with the acquisition of companies that LMG
has an investment in. The gains  represent the  difference  between the carrying
value of LMG's interest in the acquired company and the fair value of securities
received in the merger. In particular,  Flextech was acquired by Telewest in the
second quarter of 2000 and General  Instruments  was acquired by Motorola in the
first quarter of 2000.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1,945 million for the first
six months  ended  June 30,  2000,  compared  with the prior  year  period.  The
increase was primarily driven by a decrease in cash tax payments  resulting from
the first  quarter  1999 tax  payment on the gain on the 1998 sale of  Universal
Card  Services  Inc.  and  an  increase  in   operational   earnings   excluding
depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher accounts receivable.

Net cash used by investing  activities  for the first half of 2000  increased by
$10,477 million compared with the first half of 1999. The increase was primarily
driven by the  increased  acquisitions  in 2000,  particularly  MediaOne and CMT
Partners,  and increased capital expenditures in 2000 primarily  attributable to
growth in Wireless and Broadband,  partially  offset by the contribution of $5.5
billion of cash to LMG in 1999.

During  the  first  half of 2000,  net cash  provided  by  financing  activities
increased by $10,676 million  compared with the first half of 1999. The increase
was primarily due to higher  proceeds  from  issuance of  short-term  debt,  the
proceeds from the initial  public  offering of AT&T Wireless  Group shares and a
decrease in the  purchase of treasury  stock.  These  increases  were  partially
offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of
redeemable  securities  in 1999.  At June 30,  2000,  we had  $25.7  billion  in
short-term  notes  outstanding,  the majority of which was commercial  paper and
debt with an  original  maturity  of one year or less.  We expect to finance the
repayment of this  short-term  debt through a  combination  of other  short-term
borrowings and our long-term borrowing capacity.

Earnings,  including other income,  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization,  and  minority  interest  (EBITDA)  is a measure of our ability to
generate  cash flow and  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  but not as a
substitute for, other measures of financial  performance  reported in accordance
with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  EBITDA was $10,505 million for
the first  half of the year,  an  increase  of 20.1% over the first half of last
year.  The  EBITDA  growth  was  impacted  by gains on sales of  businesses  and
investments,   our   investments  in  Excite@Home   and   Cablevision   and  net
restructuring and other charges.  Excluding these items, EBITDA increased $1,920
million,  or 20.6%,  over the first  half of last year to $11,243  million.  The
improvement  was primarily due to  operational  efficiencies  which  resulted in
higher operating income, and increased other income.

EURO CONVERSION
On January 1, 1999,  certain  members of the European  Union  established  fixed
conversion  rates between their  existing  currencies  and the European  Union's
currency (Euro).  The transition period is anticipated to extend between January
1, 1999,  and July 1, 2002.  We have  assessed the impact of the  conversion  on
information-technology  systems,  currency  exchange rate risk,  derivatives and
other financial instruments,  continuity of material contracts as well as income
tax and accounting issues. We do not expect the conversion during the transition
period to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Total assets increased  $74,158  million,  or 43.8%, to $243,564 million at June
30, 2000,  compared with  December 31, 1999,  primarily due to the impact of the
MediaOne  acquisition.  Other significant activity included AT&T's investment in
Concert,  consisting of $1.7 billion of property, plant and equipment and a loan
of $1.0 billion; increased accounts receivable attributable to transactions with
Concert; and an increase in licenses resulting from wireless acquisitions.

Total liabilities  increased  $41,735 million,  or 50.0%, to $125,123 million at
June 30, 2000,  compared with December 31, 1999,  primarily due to the impact of
the MediaOne acquisition. In addition, $7.7 billion of commercial paper and $5.5
billion of one-year notes were issued in the first half of the year.

Total  shareowners'  equity  increased  $31,236  million,  or 39.6%, to $110,163
million at June 30, 2000,  compared  with  December  31, 1999.  The increase was
primarily  driven  by the  issuance  of  AT&T  common  stock  for  the  MediaOne
acquisition as well the issuance of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock which
generated $10.3 billion in net proceeds.

The ratio of total debt to total capital,  excluding LMG, (debt divided by total
debt and equity of AT&T,  excluding  LMG) was 43.3% at June 30,  2000,  compared
with 44.3% at December 31, 1999. The equity portion of this calculation includes
the  convertible  quarterly  trust  preferred  securities.  The  improvement was
primarily driven by a higher equity base associated with the MediaOne merger and
the AT&T Wireless Group initial public  offering,  largely offset by an increase
in  borrowings  primarily  associated  with the  MediaOne  merger as well as the
issuance of commercial  paper and notes during the first half of 2000.  Included
in debt is approximately  $5.5 billion of notes,  which are exchangeable into or
collateralized  by Vodafone ADRs we own.  Excluding this debt, the ratio of debt
to total capital at June 30, 2000, was 40.8%.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest,  foreign exchange rates,
and  equity  prices.  On a limited  basis we use  certain  derivative  financial

<PAGE>
                                                         AT&T Form 10-Q - Part I

instruments,   including  interest  rate  swaps,  options,  forwards  and  other
derivative contracts to manage these risks. We do not use financial  instruments
for trading or  speculative  purposes.  All  financial  instruments  are used in
accordance with board-approved policies.

Assuming a 10% downward shift in interest rates at June 30, 2000, the fair value
of unhedged debt would have increased by approximately $1.1 billion.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standard  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities."  Among other provisions,  it requires that
entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
qualifies for hedge accounting. The effective date for this standard was delayed
via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The effective date for SFAS No. 133 is now for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
encouraged and retroactive application is prohibited.  For AT&T, this means that
the standard must be adopted no later than January 1, 2001.

In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and Certain  Hedging  Activities"  as an amendment to SFAS No. 133.
This  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
issues  under  SFAS No.  133 on  specific  types  of  hedges.  We are  currently
assessing  the impact of SFAS Nos. 133 and 138 on AT&T,  including an assessment
of the impact resulting from our merger with MediaOne.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101 (SAB No. 101), "Revenue  Recognition in Financial  Statements."
The SEC  delayed the date by which  registrants  must apply the  accounting  and
disclosures  described in SAB No. 101 until the fourth  quarter of 2000.  We are
currently assessing the impact of SAB No. 101 on our results of operations.

                     Notes to Combined Financial Statements
                                  June 30, 2000

(1)      Basis of Presentation

         The accompanying  combined financial statements include the accounts of
         the subsidiaries and assets of AT&T Corp.  ("AT&T") that are attributed
         to Liberty  Media  Group,  as  defined  below.  On March 9, 1999,  AT&T
         acquired  Tele-Communications,  Inc.  ("TCI"),  the former owner of the
         assets attributed to Liberty Media Group, in a merger  transaction (the
         "AT&T  Merger").  The AT&T  Merger  has been  accounted  for  using the
         purchase  method.   Accordingly,   Liberty  Media  Group's  assets  and
         liabilities  have been recorded at their  respective fair market values
         therefor,  creating a new cost basis. For financial  reporting purposes
         the AT&T Merger and related  restructuring  transactions  are deemed to
         have occurred on March 1, 1999. Accordingly, for periods prior to March
         1, 1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed  to Liberty Media Group
         and the related combined financial statements are sometimes referred to
         herein as "Old  Liberty",  and for periods  subsequent  to February 28,
         1999 the assets and  liabilities  attributed to Liberty Media Group and
         the related  combined  financial  statements are sometimes  referred to
         herein as "New Liberty".  The "Company" and "Liberty Media Group" refer
         to both New Liberty and Old Liberty.

         At June 30, 2000,  Liberty  Media Group  consisted  principally  of the
         following:

         o    AT&T's assets and businesses  which provide  programming  services
              including  production,  acquisition and  distribution  through all
              available formats and media of branded entertainment,  educational
              and informational  programming and software,  including multimedia
              products;

         o    AT&T's  assets and  businesses  engaged in  electronic  retailing,
              direct  marketing,   advertising  sales  relating  to  programming
              services, infomercials and transaction processing;

         o    certain of AT&T's interests in technology and Internet businesses;

         o    certain of  AT&T's assets and businesses engaged  in international
              cable, telephony and programming businesses; and,

         o    AT&T's holdings in a class of tracking stock of Sprint Corporation
              (the "Sprint PCS Group Stock").

         All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
         eliminated.  The combined  financial  statements of Liberty Media Group
         are presented for purposes of additional  analysis of the  consolidated
         financial  statements  of AT&T and should be read in  conjunction  with
         such consolidated financial statements.

         The accompanying  interim combined  financial  statements are unaudited
         but, in the opinion of management,  reflect all adjustments (consisting
         of normal recurring  accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the
         results for such  periods.  The results of  operations  for any interim
         period are not  necessarily  indicative  of results  for the full year.
         These combined financial  statements should be read in conjunction with
         the combined  financial  statements  and notes  thereto  included as an
         exhibit to AT&T's  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31,
         1999.

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements  and the reported
         amounts of revenue and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
         results could differ from those estimates.

         Effective June 9, 2000,  AT&T issued stock dividends to holders of AT&T
         Liberty  Media  Group  tracking  stock (the  "Liberty  Dividend").  The
         Liberty  Dividend  consisted of one share of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group
         tracking stock for every one share of AT&T Liberty Media Group tracking
         stock  owned.  The Liberty  Dividend has been treated as a stock split,
         and  accordingly,  all share  amounts have been restated to reflect the
         Liberty Dividend.

         Certain prior period amounts have been  reclassified for  comparability
         with the 2000 presentation.

         of these  shares  can be  accomplished  only if  there  is a change  to
         existing  regulations or if Liberty Media Group obtains permission from
         the FCC. If the exchange of subsidiary stock into USAI common stock was
         completed at June 30, 2000, Liberty Media Group would own 153.4 million
         shares or approximately  21% (on a fully-diluted  basis) of USAI common
         stock.  USAI's  common  stock  reported a closing  price of $21-5/8 per

         Media Group  recognized  a $649  million  gain  (excluding  related tax
         expense of $227 million) on the  acquisition  during the second quarter
         of 2000 based on the  difference  between the carrying value of Liberty
         Media  Group's  interest in Flextech and the fair value of the Telewest
         shares received. At June 30, 2000, Liberty Media Group indirectly owned
         724 million of the issued and  outstanding  Telewest  ordinary  shares.

         On March 1, 1999,  United Video Satellite Group,  Inc. ("UVSG") and The
         News Corporation Limited ("News Corp.") completed a transaction whereby
         UVSG  acquired  News  Corp.'s TV Guide  properties,  creating a broader
         platform  for  offering  television  guide  services to  consumers  and
         advertisers,  and UVSG was renamed TV Guide. News Corp.  received total
         consideration  of $1.9  billion  including  $800  million  in cash,  45
         million shares of TV Guide's Class A common stock and 75 million shares
         of TV Guide's  Class B common  stock valued at an average of $9.325 per
         share.  In  addition,  News Corp.  purchased  approximately  13 million
         additional  shares of TV Guide's  Class A common stock for $129 million
         in order to equalize its ownership with that of Liberty Media Group. As
         a result of these transactions,  and another  transaction  completed on
         the same date,  News Corp,  Liberty  Media Group and TV Guide's  public
         stockholders own on an economic basis  approximately  44%, 44% and 12%,
         respectively, of TV Guide. Following such transactions,  News Corp. and
         Liberty Media Group each have  approximately 49% of the voting power of
         TV Guide's  outstanding  stock.  In connection  with the increase in TV
         Guide's  equity,  net of dilution of Liberty  Media  Group's  ownership
         interest in TV Guide,  Liberty  Media Group  recognized  a gain of $372
         million (before deducting deferred income taxes of $147 million).

         The Class A common  stock of TV Guide is publicly  traded.  At June 30,
         2000,  Liberty  Media Group held 58 million  shares of TV Guide Class A
         common  stock and 75 million  shares of TV Guide Class B common  stock.

         Guide Class A common stock.  TV Guide's Class A common stock reported a
         closing price of $34.25 per share on June 30, 2000.

         approximate 11% economic ownership interest representing an approximate
         37%  voting  interest  in  UnitedGlobalCom.  UnitedGlobalCom's  Class A
         common stock  reported a closing  price of $46.75 per share on June 30,
         2000.  Liberty Media Group owns 9.9 million  shares of  UnitedGlobalCom
         Class B common  stock,  which stock is  convertible,  on a  one-for-one
         basis, into UnitedGlobalCom Class A common stock.

         The $13 billion  aggregate  excess of Liberty Media  Group's  aggregate
         carrying   amount  in  its   affiliates   over  Liberty  Media  Group's

         On January 5,  2000,  Motorola  completed  the  acquisition  of General
         Instrument  Corporation  ("General  Instrument")  through  a merger  of
         General  Instrument with a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola.  In the
         merger,  each outstanding share of General  Instrument common stock was
         converted  into the right to receive  1.725  shares (as  adjusted for a
         subsequent  stock split) of Motorola  common stock.  In connection with
         the merger  Liberty Media Group received 54 million shares (as adjusted
         for a  subsequent  stock  split) and  warrants  to  purchase 37 million
         shares (as adjusted for a  subsequent  stock split) of Motorola  common
         stock in exchange for its holdings in General Instrument. Liberty Media
         Group recognized a $2.2 billion gain (excluding  related tax expense of
         $883  million)  on such  transaction  during the first  quarter of 2000
         based on the  difference  between the carrying  value of Liberty  Media
         Group's  interest  in  General  Instrument  and the  fair  value of the
         Motorola securities received.

         Liberty  Media  Group's  right to exercise  warrants  to purchase  18.4
         million  shares (as adjusted for a subsequent  stock split) of Motorola
         common  stock is  subject  to AT&T  satisfying  the terms of a purchase
         commitment  in 2000.  AT&T has agreed to pay Liberty  Media Group $4.78
         (as adjusted  for a subsequent  stock split) for each warrant that does
         not vest as a result of the purchase commitment not being met.

         Group's  investments  in   available-for-sale   securities  and  others
         aggregated  $30.9  billion  and  $29.2  billion  at June  30,  2000 and
         December  31,  1999,  respectively.   No  independent  appraisals  were
         conducted for those assets.

(5)      Acquisitions

         On January 14, 2000,  Liberty Media Group  completed its acquisition of
         Associated  Group pursuant to a merger  agreement  among AT&T,  Liberty
         Media Group and  Associated  Group.  Under the merger  agreement,  each
         share of  Associated  Group's  Class A common  stock and Class B common
         stock  was  converted  into  0.49634  shares of AT&T  common  stock and
         2.41422  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty  Media  Group  tracking  stock.
         Prior  to the  merger,  Associated  Group's  primary  assets  were  (1)
         approximately   19.7  million   shares  of  AT&T  common   stock,   (2)
         approximately  46.8 million  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group
         tracking stock, (3)  approximately  10.6 million shares of AT&T Class B
         Liberty Media Group  tracking  stock,  (4)  approximately  21.4 million
         shares of common stock,  representing  approximately a 40% interest, of
         Teligent,  and (5) all of the  outstanding  shares of  common  stock of
         TruePosition,  Inc.,  which  provides  location  services  for wireless
         carriers and users  designed to determine  the location of any wireless
         transmitter,   including  cellular  and  PCS  telephones.   Immediately
         following  the  completion  of  the  merger,  all  of  the  assets  and
         businesses of Associated Group were transferred to Liberty Media Group.
         All of the shares of AT&T  common  stock,  AT&T  Class A Liberty  Media
         Group  tracking  stock and AT&T Class B Liberty  Media  Group  tracking
         stock previously held by Associated Group were retired by AT&T.

         The acquisition of Associated Group was accounted for as a purchase and
         the $17  million  excess of the fair value of the net  assets  acquired
         over the purchase price is being  amortized over ten years. As a result
         of the issuance of AT&T Liberty Media Group tracking stock,  net of the
         shares of AT&T  Liberty  Media Group  tracking  stock  acquired in this
         transaction,  Liberty Media Group  recorded a $778 million  increase to
         combined equity.

         On March 16, 2000,  Liberty Media Group  purchased  shares of preferred
         stock in TCI  Satellite  Entertainment,  Inc.  ("TSAT") in exchange for
         Liberty  Media Group's  economic  interest in  approximately  5 million
         shares of Sprint PCS Group Stock, valued at $300 million. Liberty Media
         Group received 150,000 shares of TSAT Series A 12% Cumulative Preferred
         Stock and  150,000  shares of TSAT Series B 8%  Cumulative  Convertible
         Voting  Preferred  Stock.  The Series A  preferred  stock does not have
         voting rights,  while the Series B preferred  stock gives Liberty Media
         Group approximately 85% of the voting power of TSAT. In connection with
         this  transaction,  Liberty  Media Group  realized a $211  million gain
         (before related tax expense of $84 million) during the first quarter of
         2000 based on the  difference  between the cost basis and fair value of
         the economic interest in the Sprint PCS Group Stock exchanged.

         On March 28, 2000,  Liberty Media Group announced that it had completed
         its cash  tender  offer  for the  outstanding  common  stock of  Ascent
         Entertainment  Group,  Inc.  ("Ascent") at a price of $15.25 per share.
         Approximately  85% of the outstanding  shares of common stock of Ascent
         were tendered in the offer and Liberty  Media Group paid  approximately
         $385  million.  On June 8, 2000,  Liberty  Media  Group  completed  its
         acquisition  of 100% of Ascent  for an  additional  $67  million.  Such
         transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the $283 million excess
         of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
         being amortized over 20 years.

         On April 10, 2000,  Liberty Media Group acquired all of the outstanding
         common  stock of Four Media  Company  ("Four  Media") in  exchange  for
         approximately $123 million,  6.4 million shares of AT&T Class A Liberty
         Media  Group  tracking  stock and a warrant to  purchase  approximately
         700,000 shares of AT&T Class A Liberty Media Group tracking stock at an
         exercise price of $23 per share. The acquisition was accounted for as a
         purchase.  In  connection  with this  acquisition,  Liberty Media Group
         recorded  a $145  million  increase  to  combined  equity  and the $307
         million  excess of the  purchase  price  over the fair value of the net
         assets acquired is being  amortized over 20 years.  Four Media provides
         technical and creative  services to owners,  producers and distributors
         of  television  programming,  feature  films  and  other  entertainment
         products both domestically and internationally.

         On June 9, 2000, Liberty Media Group acquired a controlling interest in
         The Todd-AO  Corporation  ("Todd-AO"),  consisting of approximately 6.5
         million shares of Class B Common Stock of Todd-AO,  representing 60% of
         the  equity  and  approximately  94% of the  voting  power  of  Todd-AO
         outstanding   immediately  prior  to  the  closing,   in  exchange  for
         approximately  5.4 million  shares of AT&T Class A Liberty  Media Group
         tracking stock.  The  acquisition  was accounted for as a purchase.  In
         connection with this  acquisition,  Liberty Media Group recorded a $101
         million  increase to combined  equity and the $94 million excess of the
         purchase price over the fair value of the net assets  acquired is being
         amortized over 20 years.  Todd-AO  provides sound,  video and ancillary
         post  production  and  distribution  services to the motion picture and
         television industries in the United States and Europe.

         Immediately  following the closing of such  transaction,  Liberty Media
         Group  contributed  to Todd-AO 100% of the capital stock of Four Media,
         in exchange for approximately 16.6 million shares of the Class B Common
         Stock of Todd-AO increasing Liberty Media Group's ownership interest in
         Todd-AO to approximately 84% of the equity and approximately 98% of the
         voting power of Todd-AO outstanding immediately following the closing.

         Following  Liberty  Media  Group's  acquisition  of  Todd-AO,  and  the
         contribution by Liberty Media Group to Todd-AO of Liberty Media Group's
         ownership in Four Media,  Todd-AO changed its name to Liberty  Livewire
         Corporation.

<FN>
         (a)      On February 2, 2000,  Liberty  Media Group  received  net cash
                  proceeds of  approximately  $983  million from the issuance of
                  8-1/4% Senior  Debentures due 2030. The senior debentures have
                  an aggregate  principal amount of $1 billion.  Interest on the
                  senior  debentures  is payable  on  February 1 and August 1 of
                  each year.

         (b)      On  February 10, 2000,  Liberty Media Group  received net cash
                  proceeds of $735  million  from the  issuance of $750  million
                  principal amount of 3-3/4% Senior Exchangeable  Debentures due
                  2030. On March 8, 2000,  Liberty Media Group received net cash
                  proceeds of $59 million from the issuance of an additional $60
                  million   principal  amount  of  3-3/4%  Senior   Exchangeable
                  Debentures  due 2030.  Each debenture has a $1,000 face amount
                  and is  exchangeable  at the holder's  option for the value of
                  16.7764 shares of Sprint PCS Group Stock.  This amount will be
                  paid only in cash until the later of February 15, 2002 and the
                  date the direct  and  indirect  ownership  level of Sprint PCS
                  Group  Stock  owned  by  Liberty  Media  Group  falls  below a
                  designated  level,  after  which,  at  Liberty  Media  Group's
                  election,  Liberty  Media  Group  may pay the  amount in cash,
                  Sprint PCS Group Stock or a combination  thereof.  Interest on
                  these  exchangeable  debentures  is payable on February 15 and
                  August  15  of  each  year.   The   carrying   amount  of  the
                  exchangeable debentures in excess of the principal amount (the
                  "Contingent  Portion)  is  based  on  the  fair  value  of the
                  underlying Sprint PCS Group Stock. The increase or decrease in
                  the  Contingent  Portion  is  recorded  as  an  adjustment  to
                  interest  expense in the combined  statement of operations and
                  comprehensive earnings.

         (c)      On January 7, 2000, a trust, which holds Liberty Media Group's
                  investment  in  Sprint,  entered  into  agreements  to loan 18
                  million shares of Sprint PCS Group Stock to a third party,  as
                  Agent.  The  obligation  to return  those shares is secured by
                  cash  collateral  equal  to 100% of the  market  value of that
                  stock.  During the period of the loan,  which is terminable by
                  either  party  at  any  time,  the  cash  collateral  is to be
                  marked-to-market  daily. The trust, for the benefit of Liberty
                  Media Group,  has the use of 80% of the cash  collateral  plus
                  any interest  earned  thereon during the term of the loan, and
                  is  required  to pay a rebate fee equal to the  Federal  funds
                  rate  less 30  basis  points  to the  borrower  of the  loaned
                  shares.  The cash  collateral of $423 million at June 30, 2000
                  included  $205 million of  restricted  cash. At June 30, 2000,
                  Liberty  Media  Group had  utilized  $603  million of the cash
                  collateral under the securities lending agreement.
</FN>
</TABLE>
         At June 30, 2000, Liberty Media Group had approximately $236 million in
         unused  lines of credit  under  its bank  credit  facilities.  The bank
         credit facilities of Liberty Media Group generally contain  restrictive
         covenants which require, among other things, the maintenance of certain
         financial  ratios,  and include  limitations  on  indebtedness,  liens,
         encumbrances,  acquisitions,  dispositions,  guarantees  and dividends.
         Liberty Media Group was in compliance  with its debt  covenants at June
         30, 2000. Additionally, Liberty Media Group pays fees ranging from .15%
         to .375%  per annum on the  average  unborrowed  portions  of the total
         amounts available for borrowings under bank credit facilities.

         Based on quoted market prices,  the fair value of Liberty Media Group's
         debt at June 30, 2000 is as follows (amounts in millions):

                 Senior notes of parent company                    $      720
                 Senior debentures of parent company                    1,392
                 Senior exchangeable debentures of
                   parent company                                       2,134
                 Senior notes of attributed subsidiary                    183

         Liberty Media Group believes that the carrying  amount of the remainder
         of its debt approximated its fair value at June 30, 2000.

(7)      Combined Equity

         AT&T Liberty Media Group Tracking Stock

         In conjunction with a stock repurchase program or similar  transaction,
         the  issuer  may  elect to sell put  options  on it own  common  stock.
         Proceeds  from any sales of puts with  respect  to AT&T  Liberty  Media
         Group  tracking  stock is reflected as an increase to combined  equity,
         and an amount equal to the maximum  redemption  amount under  unexpired
         put options  with  respect to such  tracking  stock is  reflected as an
         "Obligation to redeem AT&T Liberty Media Group  tracking  stock" in the
         accompanying combined balance sheets.

         During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2000,  pursuant  to a stock
         repurchase program, 400,000 shares of AT&T Liberty Media Group tracking
         stock were purchased at an aggregate cost of $9 million. Such amount is
         reflected as a decrease to combined equity in the accompanying combined
         financial statements.

         Stock Issuances of Subsidiary

         During  the six months  ended  June 30,  2000,  Liberty  Digital,  Inc.
         ("Liberty  Digital") issued  approximately 4.2 million shares of common
         stock in  connection  with  certain  acquisitions  and the  exercise of
         certain  employee  stock  options.  In connection  with the increase in
         Liberty Digital's equity,  net of the dilution of Liberty Media Group's
         interest in Liberty  Digital,  that resulted from such stock issuances,
         Liberty  Media  Group  recorded a $169  million  increase  to  combined
         equity.

         Transactions with Officers and Directors

         Prior to the AT&T Merger, a limited liability company owned by Dr. John
         C.  Malone  (Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Liberty  Media  Corporation)
         acquired,  from certain attributed subsidiaries of Liberty Media Group,
         for $17 million,  working cattle ranches located in Wyoming. No gain or
         loss was recognized on such acquisition. The purchase price was paid by
         such limited  liability  company in the form of a 12-month  note in the
         amount of $17 million having an interest rate of 7%. Such note was paid
         in March 2000.

         In connection with the AT&T Merger, Liberty Media Group paid two of its
         directors and one other individual, all three of whom were directors of
         TCI, an aggregate of $12 million for  services  rendered in  connection
         with the AT&T Merger.  Such amount is included in  operating,  selling,
         general and  administrative  expenses for the two months ended February
         28, 1999 in the  accompanying  combined  statements of  operations  and
         comprehensive earnings.

         Transactions with AT&T

         Certain AT&T corporate general and administrative  costs are charged to
         Liberty Media Group based on the cost of services provided.  Management
         believes this  allocation  method is reasonable.  During the six months
         ended June 30,  2000,  the four months  ended June 30, 1999 and the two
         months ended  February  28, 1999  Liberty  Media Group was charged less
         than $1 million, less than $1 million and $2 million,  respectively, in
         corporate  general and  administrative  costs by AT&T.  These costs are
         included in operating,  selling, general and administrative expenses in
         the accompanying  combined  statements of operations and  comprehensive
         earnings.

         Certain  subsidiaries  attributed to Liberty Media Group produce and/or
         distribute   programming  and  other  services  to  cable  distribution
         operators  (including AT&T) and others.  Charges to AT&T are based upon
         customary  rates  charged to others.  Amounts  included  in revenue for
         services  provided  to AT&T  were $111  million,  $71  million  and $43
         million for the six months ended June 30, 2000,  the four months ending
         June 30,  1999 and the two  month  period  ending  February  28,  1999,
         respectively.

         Subsidiaries  of  Liberty  Media  Group  lease  satellite   transponder
         facilities from a subsidiary of AT&T. Charges for such arrangements and
         other related operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2000
         and the four months ended June 30, 1999  aggregated  $9 million and $10
         million,  respectively,  and are included in operating  expenses in the
         accompanying   combined  statements  of  operations  and  comprehensive
         earnings.

                                   (continued)

         Liberty Media Group makes marketing  support payments to AT&T.  Charges
         by AT&T for such  arrangements were $1 million for the six months ended
         June 30,  2000 and less  than $1  million  for each of the four  months
         ended June 30, 1999 and the two months ended February 28, 1999.

         A certain  subsidiary  attributed  to  Liberty  Media  Group  purchases
         programming  services from AT&T. The charges,  which approximate AT&T's
         cost and are based on the aggregate number of subscribers served by the
         subsidiary, aggregated $4 million, $2 million and $1 million during the
         six months ended June 30, 2000, the four months ended June 30, 1999 and
         the two months ended February 28, 1999, respectively,  and are included
         in  operating  expenses  in the  accompanying  combined  statements  of
         operations and comprehensive earnings.

         During the quarter  ended June 30, 2000, a subsidiary  of Liberty Media
         Group entered into an agreement for AT&T to provide  dedicated  hosting
         services to the  subsidiary.  As of June 30, 2000, no amounts have been
         paid to AT&T for such services.

         Due to Related Parties

         The  amounts  included  in  "Due  to  related   parties"   represent  a
         non-interest  bearing  intercompany  account which includes  income tax
         allocations  that are to be  settled  at some  future  date.  All other
         amounts included in the  intercompany  account are to be settled within
         thirty days following notification.

(8)      Commitments and Contingencies

         Starz  Encore  Group  LLC  ("Starz  Encore  Group")   provides  premium
         programming  distributed  by cable,  direct  satellite,  TVRO and other
         distributors  throughout  the  United  States.  Starz  Encore  Group is
         obligated to pay fees for the rights to exhibit  certain films that are
         released  by  various  producers  through  2017  (the  "Film  Licensing
         Obligations").  Based  on  customer  levels  at June  30,  2000,  these
         agreements  require minimum  payments  aggregating  approximately  $1.2
         billion.  The aggregate amount of the Film Licensing  Obligations under
         these license agreements is not currently estimable because such amount
         is dependent upon the number of qualifying films released  theatrically
         by certain  motion picture  studios as well as the domestic  theatrical
         exhibition   receipts  upon  the  release  of  such  qualifying  films.
         Nevertheless,  required  aggregate  payments  under the Film  Licensing
         Obligations could prove to be significant.

         Liberty  Media  Group has  guaranteed  various  loans,  notes  payable,
         letters of credit and other obligations (the "Guaranteed  Obligations")
         of certain  affiliates.  At June 30, 2000, the  Guaranteed  Obligations
         aggregated approximately $774 million.  Currently,  Liberty Media Group
         is not certain of the  likelihood  of being  required to perform  under
         such guarantees.

         Pursuant  to a final  judgment  (the  "Final  Judgment")  agreed  to by
         Liberty Media  Corporation,  AT&T and the United  States  Department of
         Justice  (the  "DOJ")  on  December  31,  1998,   Liberty  Media  Group
         transferred  all of its  beneficially  owned  securities  (the  "Sprint
         Securities") of Sprint to a trustee (the  "Trustee")  prior to the AT&T
         Merger.  The Final  Judgment,  which was  entered by the United  States
         District  Court  for the  District  of  Columbia  on August  23,  1999,
         requires  the  Trustee,  on or before  May 23,  2002,  to  dispose of a
         portion of the Sprint  Securities  sufficient  to cause  Liberty  Media
         Group to beneficially own no more than 10% of the outstanding  Series 1
         PCS Stock of Sprint on a fully diluted basis on such date. On or before
         May 23,  2004,  the  Trustee  must divest the  remainder  of the Sprint
         Securities beneficially owned by Liberty Media Group.

         The Final Judgment requires that the Trustee vote the Sprint Securities
         beneficially  owned by Liberty  Media Group in the same  proportion  as
         other  holders of Sprint's  PCS Group Stock so long as such  securities
         are  held  by  the  trust.   The  Final  Judgment  also  prohibits  the
         acquisition  by Liberty  Media Group of additional  Sprint  Securities,
         with certain exceptions, without the prior written consent of the DOJ.

         Liberty  Media Group  leases  business  offices,  has entered into pole
         rental and  transponder  lease  agreements  and uses certain  equipment
         under lease arrangements.

         Liberty  Media  Group  has  contingent  liabilities  related  to  legal
         proceedings  and  other  matters  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of
         business.  Although it is reasonably  possible  Liberty Media Group may
         incur losses upon  conclusion of such matters,  an estimate of any loss
         or range of loss cannot be made.  In the opinion of  management,  it is
         expected  that amounts,  if any,  which may be required to satisfy such
         contingencies  will not be material  in  relation  to the  accompanying
         combined financial statements.

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                              (Dollars in Millions)
                                   (Unaudited)


(a)      BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         Background

         On April 27, 2000,  AT&T completed an initial public offering of 15.6%,
         or 360 million shares,  of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an
         initial  public  offering  price of $29.50  per  share.  This  stock is
         designed  to  track  the  performance  of  AT&T's   wireless   services
         businesses.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock  issued  in the
         initial  public  offering  reflected  only a  portion  of the  economic
         interest  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group.  AT&T  retained  the  remaining
         interest in the economic  performance of the AT&T Wireless Group in the
         form of an inter-group  interest which represented an 84.4% interest as
         of the date of the initial public offering and at June 30, 2000.

         Basis of Presentation

         The AT&T Wireless  Group is a fully  integrated  business unit of AT&T.
         There  are  differences  between  the  results  reported  for the  AT&T
         Wireless Group and the AT&T wireless  segment results reported by AT&T,
         for periods  prior to the initial  public  offering.  The AT&T Wireless
         Group   includes  the  results  of  its  mobility  and  fixed  wireless
         businesses,  as well as its international  operations,  which primarily
         include the  earnings or losses  associated  with equity  interests  in
         international wireless  communications  ventures and partnerships.  The
         combined  financial  statements  reflect  the  results  of  operations,
         financial  position,  changes  in  equity  and  cash  flows of the AT&T
         Wireless  Group  as if it  were  a  separate  entity  for  all  periods
         presented.   The  financial   information   included   herein  may  not
         necessarily  reflect  the  combined  results of  operations,  financial
         position,  changes in equity and cash flows of the AT&T Wireless  Group
         had  it  been  a  separate,   stand-alone  entity  during  the  periods
         presented.  Additionally,  the combined results for the interim periods
         presented are not necessarily  indicative of results for the full year.
         The combined financial  statements of the AT&T Wireless Group should be
         read in conjunction  with AT&T's  registration  statement filed on Form
         S-3 dated February 2, 2000, including the prospectus filed on April 27,
         2000, related to the initial public offering of the AT&T Wireless Group
         tracking stock. In addition, these combined financial statements should
         be read in  conjunction  with  AT&T's  Form  10-K  for the  year  ended
         December 31, 1999 and AT&T's Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
         2000, and June 30, 2000.

         The combined financial statements of the AT&T Wireless Group conform to
         generally  accepted  accounting  principles.   The  combined  financial
         statements  reflect  the  assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses
         directly   attributable   to  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group,  as  well  as
         allocations deemed reasonable by management,  to present the results of
         operations,  financial  position  and cash  flows of the AT&T  Wireless
         Group on a stand-alone  basis. The allocation  methodologies  have been
         described within the notes to the combined  financial  statements where
         appropriate.
<PAGE>
         The initial  public  offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock
         resulted  in  net  proceeds  to  AT&T,  after  deducting  underwriter's
         discount  and  related  fees  and  expenses,  of  $10.3  billion.  AT&T
         attributed  $7.0 billion of the net proceeds to the AT&T Wireless Group
         in the form of an intercompany note receivable which is included in the
         accompanying  combined  balance  sheet  as of June 30,  2000,  as "Note
         receivable from AT&T". Changes in the note receivable reflect transfers
         between  the AT&T  Wireless  Group and AT&T  subsequent  to the initial
         public offering,  primarily to fund acquisitions and capital expansion.
         Interest on the note  receivable is  calculated  based upon the average
         daily  balance  outstanding  at a rate  equal to the one  month  London
         InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) minus 6 basis points, a rate designed to
         be equivalent  to the rate the AT&T Wireless  Group would receive if it
         were a stand-alone entity.

         Prior to the initial public offering, the capital structure of the AT&T
         Wireless  Group had been assumed based upon AT&T's  historical  capital
         ratio  adjusted  for certain  items.  This  resulted in $3.4 billion in
         intercompany  indebtedness at December 31, 1999, paying annual interest
         at 7.25%. In addition, as of December 31, 1999, the AT&T Wireless Group
         had issued and  outstanding,  $1.0 billion of 9%  cumulative  preferred
         stock to AT&T that,  subject to the approval of the AT&T Wireless Group
         capital stock committee, is redeemable at the option of AT&T. On May 1,
         2000,  following the initial public offering of the AT&T Wireless Group
         tracking stock,  $2.0 billion of the AT&T Wireless Group's  outstanding
         intercompany  indebtedness to AT&T was recapitalized into an additional
         $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred stock. In conjunction with the
         recapitalization,  the  remaining  long  term  debt due to AT&T of $1.8
         billion was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest
         at a fixed rate of 8.1% per annum.  The interest rate is designed to be
         substantially  equivalent  to the interest  rate that the AT&T Wireless
         Group would be able to obtain from third parties,  including the public
         markets, as a non-affiliate of AT&T without the benefit of any guaranty
         by AT&T.

         Changes  in  combined  equity  prior  to the  initial  public  offering
         represented  net transfers to or from AT&T,  after giving effect to the
         net income or loss of the AT&T  Wireless  Group during the period,  and
         were assumed to be settled in cash.  AT&T's capital  contributions  for
         purchase  business   combinations  and  initial  investments  in  joint
         ventures and  partnerships  which AT&T  attributed to the AT&T Wireless
         Group have been  treated as noncash  transactions  prior to the initial
         public offering.

(b)      RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) issued
         Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (SAB) No.  101,  "Revenue  Recognition  in
         Financial  Statements".  SAB  No.  101  provides  guidance  on  revenue
         recognition,  including  service  activation  fees, and certain related
         costs,  which  requires  adoption  by the  end  of  fiscal  year  2000.
         Management  is  currently  assessing  the  impact of SAB No. 101 to the
         combined  results of  operations  and  financial  position  of the AT&T
         Wireless Group.
<PAGE>
         In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued
         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting
         for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities".   Among  other
         provisions,  it requires that entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as
         either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and
         measure those  instruments  at fair value.  Gains and losses  resulting
         from changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be accounted
         for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for
         hedge  accounting.  The effective date of this standard was delayed via
         the  issuance of SFAS No. 137. The  effective  date for SFAS No. 133 is
         now for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15, 2000,  though  earlier
         adoption is encouraged and retroactive  application is prohibited.  For
         the AT&T Wireless  Group,  this means that the standard must be adopted
         no later than January 1, 2001.  Management does not expect the adoption
         of this  standard  will have a  material  impact  on the AT&T  Wireless
         Group's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

         In June 2000,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  138,  "Accounting  for Certain
         Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" as an amendment
         to SFAS No. 133. This statement  provides  clarification with regard to
         certain  implementation  issues under SFAS No. 133 on specific types of
         hedges.  It is not  expected  to have a  material  impact  on the  AT&T
         Wireless  Group's  results of  operations,  financial  position or cash
         flows.

(c)      ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

         On June 19, 2000, the AT&T Wireless Group  announced that it had signed
         definitive  agreements to acquire wireless systems in the San Francisco
         Bay Area,  San Diego and Houston for $3.3 billion in cash.  On June 29,
         2000,  the AT&T Wireless  Group  completed the  acquisition of Vodafone
         Airtouch  plc's 50%  partnership  interest  in CMT  Partners  (Bay Area
         Properties),  which holds controlling interest in five Bay Area markets
         including San Francisco and San Jose, for approximately $1.8 billion in
         cash,  thereby giving the AT&T Wireless Group a 100% ownership interest
         in this  partnership.  The  transaction was recorded under the purchase
         method of accounting.  The excess of aggregate  purchase price over the
         fair value of net  tangible  assets  acquired,  based on a  preliminary
         allocation,  totaled $1,457,  and has been assigned to licensing costs,
         goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  and is being  amortized  over
         periods of five to 40 years. We may make  refinements to the allocation
         of the  purchase  price in future  periods  as the  related  fair value
         appraisals of certain assets and  liabilities  are finalized.  Prior to
         consummation  of  this  transaction,  the  AT&T  Wireless  Group's  50%
         ownership  interest  in CMT  Partners  was  accounted  for as an equity
         investment.  Accordingly,  as a  result  of the  transaction,  $190 was
         reclassified from investments to goodwill on the accompanying  combined
         balance sheet.  The  transactions  related to the Houston and San Diego
         markets  have been  approved by the boards of directors of AT&T and the
         selling entities,  however,  are subject to certain federal  regulatory
         approvals,  which  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  expects  will  result  in
         ownership adjustments in an existing Houston market. These transactions
         are expected to close by the end of 2000.

         On June 1, 2000, the AT&T Wireless Group  completed its  acquisition of
         the assets of Wireless One Network,  L.P.,  for  approximately  $850 in
         cash,  acquiring  wireless systems in northwest and southwest  Florida.
         The  transaction  was recorded under the purchase method of accounting.
         Accordingly,  the operating results of Wireless One Network, L.P., have
         been included in the accompanying  combined financial  statements since
         the date of  acquisition.  The excess of aggregate  purchase price over

<PAGE>

         the fair value of net tangible assets acquired,  based on a preliminary
         allocation,  totaled  $780 and has been  assigned to  licensing  costs,
         goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  and is being  amortized  over
         periods of five to 40 years. We may make  refinements to the allocation
         of the  purchase  price in future  periods  as the  related  fair value
         appraisals of certain assets and liabilities are finalized.

         On  February  28,  2000,  AT&T and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation
         (Dobson) acquired American Cellular  Corporation  (American  Cellular),
         through  a  joint  venture,   for  approximately  $2.4  billion.   AT&T
         contributed  its  interest  in the joint  venture to the AT&T  Wireless
         Group as of the date of the  acquisition.  The  acquisition  was funded
         with  non-recourse  bank  debt by the  joint  venture  and cash  equity
         contributions  of  approximately  $400 from  each of the two  partners.
         Dobson is responsible  for day-to-day  management of the joint venture,
         which is equally  owned and jointly  controlled  by Dobson and the AT&T
         Wireless  Group.  Accordingly,  this  investment is accounted for as an
         equity  method  investment  in  the  accompanying   combined  financial
         statements.

         On February 29, 2000, TeleCorp PCS, Inc. announced that it had signed a
         definitive  merger  agreement  with  Tritel,  Inc.  as  part  of  stock
         transaction valued at approximately $5.3 billion. Pursuant to the terms
         of the agreement,  each company will merge with a separate newly formed
         subsidiary  of a new holding  company that will be named  TeleCorp PCS,
         Inc. upon  consummation  of the  transaction.  The AT&T Wireless  Group
         currently  holds equity  interests in each of TeleCorp and Tritel which
         are both  affiliates of the AT&T Wireless Group. In connection with the
         merger,  the AT&T Wireless Group will  contribute to TeleCorp rights to
         acquire   additional   wireless   licenses  in   Wisconsin   and  Iowa,
         approximately $20 in cash and extend the term of its network membership
         license agreement to the merged entity or its operating subsidiaries in
         exchange for approximately  $410 of common shares in the newly combined
         company.  This  transaction will bring the AT&T Wireless Group's equity
         stake  in the  combined  TeleCorp  and  Tritel  to  approximately  23%.
         Additionally, in a separate transaction, the AT&T Wireless Group agreed
         to exchange certain wireless  properties and rights to acquire licenses
         in  Wisconsin  and  Iowa  markets,   as  well  as  a  cash  payment  of
         approximately  $80. In return,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group will  receive
         TeleCorp's  Boston  operating  segment,  which includes PCS licenses in
         several New England markets.  The boards of directors of AT&T, TeleCorp
         and  Tritel  have   approved  the   transactions.   Both  the  exchange
         transactions  and the merger  transactions  are  subject to  regulatory
         approval and are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2000.

         In June 2000,  the AT&T Wireless  Group sold its interest in two equity
         investments for cash resulting in pretax gains of approximately $141.

(d)      COMMITMENTS

         In the normal course of business, the AT&T Wireless Group is subject to
         proceedings,  lawsuits  and other  claims.  Such matters are subject to
         many  uncertainties  and outcomes are not  predictable  with assurance.
         Consequently,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group is  unable  to  ascertain  the
         ultimate  aggregate  amount of monetary  liability or financial  impact
         with respect to these matters at June 30, 2000. The AT&T Wireless Group
         also makes routine filings with the Federal  Communications  Commission
         and the state  regulatory  authorities.  These matters could affect the
         operating  results of any one quarter when resolved in future  periods.
         However,  the AT&T Wireless Group believes that after final disposition
         any monetary  liability or financial impact beyond that provided for as
         of June 30,  2000,  would not be  material  to the  combined  financial
         statements.
<PAGE>

         In the second  quarter of 1999,  the AT&T Wireless Group entered into a
         four-year  commitment  to  purchase  $1  billion  in  wireless  network
         equipment.  As of June 30, 2000,  the AT&T Wireless Group had fulfilled
         its commitment.

         The AT&T Wireless  Group has agreements  with other  wireless  carriers
         regarding  subscriber  activity on other  carriers'  wireless  systems.
         These agreements  establish general terms and charges for system usage,
         and in some cases also establish minimum usage requirements.

         The AT&T Wireless Group also has various other purchase commitments for
         materials,  supplies and other items  incidental to the ordinary course
         of  business  which  are  not  significant  individually,  nor  in  the
         aggregate.

(e)      RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         As discussed in Note (a), AT&T has provided  necessary  working capital
         requirements  to the AT&T Wireless  Group through an  attribution  of a
         portion of the initial public offering proceeds,  intercompany debt and
         preferred stock, as well as capital  contributions prior to the initial
         public  offering.  These  amounts  are  reflected  in the  accompanying
         combined balance sheets as "Note receivable from AT&T", "Long-term debt
         due to AT&T" and "Preferred stock held by AT&T".

         Intercompany  interest income on the note receivable from AT&T for each
         of the three and six month  periods  ended June 30, 2000,  totaled $67.
         The  intercompany   interest  income  was  determined  based  upon  the
         methodology  described in Note (a) and is included  within other income
         in the accompanying combined statements of operations.

         Intercompany  debt and  interest  expense  was  assumed  based upon the
         methodology  discussed  in Note (a).  Intercompany  debt was $1,800 and
         $3,400  at  June  30,  2000  and  December   31,  1999,   respectively.
         Intercompany  interest  expense  was $49 and  $55 for the  three  month
         periods ended June 30, 2000, and 1999,  respectively,  of which $34 and
         $20, respectively,  was capitalized.  Intercompany interest expense was
         $121 and $103 for the six month  periods  ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
         respectively, of which $58 and $37, respectively, was capitalized.

         The 9% cumulative preferred stock was $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2000,
         and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 1999.  Dividend  requirements  were
         $33 and $13 for the three month  periods  ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
         respectively,  and $46 and $27 for the six month periods ended June 30,
         2000 and 1999, respectively.

         The  AT&T   Wireless   Group   purchases   long   distance   and  other
         network-related  services  from AT&T at  market-based  prices.  For the
         three month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, these amounts totaled
         $64 and $38,  respectively.  For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and
         1999, these amounts totaled $116 and $72,  respectively.  These amounts
         are reflected within costs of services and products in the accompanying
         combined statements of operations.

         AT&T has  allocated  general  corporate  overhead  expenses,  including
         finance, legal, marketing, use of the AT&T brand, planning and strategy
         and human  resources to the AT&T Wireless  Group,  as well as costs for
         AT&T employees who directly support the AT&T Wireless Group,  amounting
         to $13 and $10 for the three  month  periods  ended  June 30,  2000 and
         1999,  respectively,  and $26 and $20 for the six month  periods  ended
         June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These amounts are included within
         selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  accompanying
         combined statements of operations.
<PAGE>
         Also  included in  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  are
         charges paid to AT&T related to the AT&T Wireless  Group's direct sales
         force who were employees of AT&T, as well as commissions  and marketing
         support  costs  reimbursed  to  AT&T  for  costs  incurred  to  acquire
         customers on our behalf.  These charges  amounted to $7 and $58 for the
         three month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and $67
         and $104 for the six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2000 and  1999,
         respectively.  Effective April 1, 2000, the aforementioned  sales force
         became employees of the AT&T Wireless Group.

         The  AT&T  Wireless  Group  purchases  their  administrative  telephone
         services from AT&T. These amounts are included within selling,  general
         and administrative expenses and totaled $24 and $16 for the three month
         periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and $48 and $31 for
         the six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         The  AT&T  Wireless  Group  sells  receivables  to  AT&T  for  wireless
         customers whose wireless  charges are combined  ("bundled")  with their
         long  distance  charges  into  one  bill.  Accounts  receivable  in the
         accompanying combined balance sheets included $90, as of June 30, 2000,
         and $83, as of December 31, 1999, associated with receivables from AT&T
         for  these  bundled  customers.  Selling,  general  and  administrative
         expenses  included $9 and $7 for the three month periods ended June 30,
         2000 and  1999,  respectively,  and  costs  of  services  and  products
         included $9 and $11 for the three month periods ended June 30, 2000 and
         1999,  respectively,  for the billing and  collection  fees  charged by
         AT&T. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $20 and $16
         for the six month periods  ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,
         and costs of services  and  products  included  $19 and $16 for the six
         month  periods  ended  June 30,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  for the
         billing and collection fees charged by AT&T.

         The  AT&T  Wireless  Group  utilizes  the  AT&T  remittance  processing
         organization to process customer payments into AT&T's lockbox. The AT&T
         Wireless Group paid $5 and $4, to AT&T for  reimbursement  of its costs
         associated  with these  services for the three month periods ended June
         30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The AT&T Wireless Group paid $10 and
         $8,  to AT&T for  reimbursement  of its  costs  associated  with  these
         services  for the six  month  periods  ended  June 30,  2000 and  1999,
         respectively.

(f)      SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         On July 24, 2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group  announced it had signed a
         definitive   agreement   with  SBC   Communications   to  acquire   its
         Indianapolis  wireless  system  for  approximately  $530 in  cash.  The
         transaction  has been  approved by the boards of  directors of AT&T and
         SBC  Communications,   however,  remains  subject  to  certain  federal
         regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2000.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW

On April 27, 2000,  AT&T completed an initial public  offering of 15.6%,  or 360
million  shares,  of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock at an initial public
offering  price of  $29.50  per  share.  This  stock is  designed  to track  the
performance  of AT&T's  wireless  services  businesses.  The AT&T Wireless Group
tracking stock issued in the initial public offering reflected only a portion of
the economic  interest of the AT&T Wireless  Group.  AT&T retained the remaining
interest in the economic  performance  of the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of
an inter-group  interest  which  represented an 84.4% interest as of the date of
the initial public  offering and at June 30, 2000. The results  included  herein
represent the AT&T Wireless Group in its entirety for all periods presented. For
the  portion  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  attributed  to the public
shareholders,  see AT&T's  Form  10-Q.  AT&T  currently  intends to dispose of a
portion of the remaining  interest in the AT&T Wireless Group in the second half
of this year.  Such  disposition  will include a  distribution  in the form of a
dividend  to AT&T  Common  Stock  Group  (which  represents  the results of AT&T
excluding the results  attributable to tracking stocks) shareowners for at least
a portion of such  interest,  but may also include an exchange  offer, a further
sale of the AT&T Wireless  Group tracking  stock or a combination  thereof.  The
method,  timing and sequence of the distribution  options,  which could occur in
stages,  will be based on the AT&T Board of Directors'  assessment of the market
conditions and other circumstances,  as appropriate, with the goal of maximizing
value for all AT&T  shareowners.  Following the  distribution we expect that the
outstanding  shares of the AT&T Wireless  Group tracking stock will reflect 100%
of the economic performance of the AT&T Wireless Group.

The AT&T Wireless  Group is a fully  integrated  business unit of AT&T. The AT&T
Wireless  Group  includes  the  results  of  its  mobility  and  fixed  wireless
businesses, as well as its international operations, which primarily include the
earnings or losses  associated with equity interests in  international  wireless
communications ventures and partnerships.

In June 2000,  the AT&T Wireless  Group closed the  acquisition of the remaining
50%  partnership  interest they previously did not own in CMT Partners (Bay Area
Properties). The Bay Area Properties cover a population base exceeding 7 million
potential  customers  and,  as  of  June  30,  2000,  served  nearly  1  million
subscribers.  The  acquisition of this entity was announced in conjunction  with
the signing of agreements to purchase wireless systems in Houston and San Diego,
which are anticipated to close later this year. The three systems combined cover
a population of approximately 15 million potential customers and, as of June 30,
2000, served more than 1.3 million subscribers.  Also in June, the AT&T Wireless
Group  completed its acquisition of Wireless One Network,  L.P.  (Wireless One).
Wireless  One owns and operates  wireless  systems in  northwest  and  southwest
Florida  covering a population base of 1.6 million  potential  customers and had
approximately  190,000  subscribers as of June 30, 2000. In February 2000,  AT&T
and  Dobson  Communications  Corporation,  through  a  joint  venture,  acquired
American  Cellular  Corporation.  AT&T  contributed  its  interest  in the joint
venture  to the AT&T  Wireless  Group as of the  date of the  acquisition.  This
acquisition  increased the AT&T Wireless  Group's coverage in New York State and
several midwest markets by adding approximately 450,000 subscribers.

COMBINED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 COMPARED WITH THE THREE
AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 1999
Revenue

Total revenue  includes  wireless voice and data services,  the sale of handsets
and accessories,  and revenue  associated with the aviation  communications  and
fixed wireless  operations.  The AT&T Wireless Group records revenue as services
are provided or when the product is sold.  Services revenue  primarily  includes
monthly recurring charges,  airtime and toll usage charges,  and roaming charges
billed to  subscribers  for usage outside of the AT&T Wireless  Group network as
well as  charges  billed to other  wireless  providers  for  roaming on the AT&T
Wireless Group network.

Total revenue  increased 31.9% to $2,477 million,  and increased 35.9% to $4,675
million for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  respectively,
compared  with the  respective  prior year periods.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's
results  include  the  revenue  associated  with  Vanguard  Cellular  since  its
acquisition  on May 3, 1999.  Total  revenue  increased  29.4% and 31.1% for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, respectively, compared with the
same  periods for 1999,  adjusted to exclude  Vanguard  Cellular  for the period
January 2000 to April 2000, to correlate  results with 1999, due to the May 1999
acquisition.

The revenue  increases  were  primarily  due to growth in our mobility  business
revenue,  driven by strong  consolidated  subscriber growth and continued rising
average monthly revenue per user (ARPU). AT&T Digital One Rate service continues
to contribute to the increase in ARPU and subscribers by acquiring and retaining
high  value  customers,  who have a  significantly  higher  ARPU than an average
subscriber.  As of June 30, 2000, the number of  subscribers  using AT&T Digital
One Rate service was 2.4 million,  an increase of 66.2%,  compared with June 30,
1999, of which nearly 73% were new  subscribers  to the AT&T Wireless  Group for
the six months ended June 30, 2000.

Services  revenue for the three month  period  ended June 30,  2000,  was $2,240
million,  an increase of $551 million,  or 32.7%,  compared with the  respective
period in 1999.  Services  revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2000,
was $4,232 million, an increase of $1,171 million,  or 38.3%,  compared with the
respective period in 1999.
<PAGE>
As of June 30,  2000,  the AT&T  Wireless  Group had 11.7  million  consolidated
subscribers,  an increase of 33.8%, compared with the prior year, of which 85.1%
were digital  subscribers,  up from 69.2% as of June 30, 1999. Included in these
figures were nearly 1 million  subscribers  from our acquisition of the Bay Area
Properties  in  June  2000  (which  were  previously   reported  as  partnership
subscribers)  and  approximately  190,000  subscribers  from our  acquisition of
Wireless One in June 2000. Net consolidated wireless subscriber additions in the
second quarter  totaled  532,000,  a 14.2% increase over the prior year quarter.
AT&T Wireless  Group's  average monthly churn rate in the second quarter of 2000
was 2.7%  compared  with 2.3% in the second  quarter of 1999.  The AT&T Wireless
Group's  average  monthly churn in the first half of 2000 was 2.8% compared with
2.5% in the first half of 1999. Total subscribers, including partnership markets
in which the AT&T  Wireless  Group  does not own a  controlling  interest,  were
nearly 14  million at the end of the second  quarter of 2000,  a 22.3%  increase
over the prior year. Ending total  subscribers  included  approximately  450,000
subscribers  associated with the AT&T Wireless  Group's  acquisition of American
Cellular in February 2000.

The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ARPU for the three  months  ended June 30, 2000 was
$71.5,  an increase of $4.9, or 7.7%,  compared with the second quarter of 1999,
and for the six months  ended June 30, 2000 was $69.4,  an increase of $5.7,  or
8.9%,  compared with the first half of 1999.  These increases were primarily due
to  increased  minutes of use per  subscriber,  driven in part by the  continued
success  of AT&T  Digital  One Rate  service.  The AT&T  Wireless  Group's  ARPU
remained  significantly  higher than the wireless  industry  average  during the
quarter and half year ended June 30, 2000, excluding the AT&T Wireless Group.

Equipment  revenue  for the three month  period  ended June 30,  2000,  was $237
million, an increase of $48 million, or 25.2%,  compared with the same period in
1999.  Equipment  revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2000, was $443
million, an increase of $63 million, or 16.6%,  compared with the same period in
1999.  These  increases were primarily due to 30.8% and 29.2% increases in gross
consolidated  subscriber additions in the three and six month periods ended June
30, 2000,  respectively,  compared with the same periods in 1999. As an integral
part of the wireless service  offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group supplies to its
subscribers a selection of handsets at competitive  prices,  which are generally
offered at or below cost.

Costs of services and products

Costs of services and products include the costs to place calls over the network
(including the costs to operate and maintain the AT&T Wireless  Group's  network
as well as  roaming  costs  paid to  other  wireless  providers),  the  costs of
handsets and accessories provided to the AT&T Wireless Group's customers and the
charges paid to connect calls on other networks, including those of AT&T.

Costs of services and products  for the three and six month  periods  ended June
30, 2000,  were $1,205  million and $2,258  million,  respectively.  This was an
increase of $265  million,  or 28.3%,  for the three month period ended June 30,
2000, and $508 million,  or 29.0%, for the six month period ended June 30, 2000,
compared with the same periods in 1999.  These  increases  were due primarily to
increases in the cost of handsets provided to subscribers which was attributable
to a 30.8% and 29.2% increase,  respectively,  in gross subscriber additions for
the three and six month  periods  ended June 30,  2000,  compared  with the same
periods  in the prior  year.  Additionally,  growth in the  subscriber  base and
increased  minutes  of usage  resulted  in an  increase  in the access and other
connection  charges paid to connect calls on other networks,  including AT&T, as
well as the costs to maintain the AT&T Wireless Group's network.

Roaming  expenses  decreased 4.4% for the quarter ended June 30, 2000,  compared
with the same period for 1999,  despite continued growth in off-network  roaming
minutes.  The decrease in roaming expenses was driven primarily by a significant
decrease  in the roaming  rate per minute of usage,  as well as  initiatives  to
aggressively migrate more minutes onto the AT&T Wireless Group's network.
<PAGE>
Selling, general and administrative

Selling,  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2000, were $763 million and $1,513 million, respectively,
compared  with  $614  million  and  $1,178  million  for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 1999.  These  increases  were primarily  attributable  to
higher  marketing and selling costs associated with the increase in consolidated
subscriber additions in the second quarter and first half of 2000, compared with
the respective  periods in 1999. Cost per gross subscriber  addition  (CPGA),
which includes the cost of handset  subsidies  recorded in costs of services and
products in the accompanying combined statement of operations, was $352 and $356
for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000,  compared with $338 and
$345 for the three and six month  periods  ended  June 30,  1999.  In  addition,
growth in the wireless  customer  base  resulted in an increase in customer care
and information technology expenses.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three month period ended June 30,
2000, were $402 million, an increase of $94 million, or 30.5%, compared with the
second quarter of 1999. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the six month
period ended June 30, 2000, were $771 million,  an increase of $187 million,  or
31.9%,  compared with the first half of 1999. These increases primarily resulted
from the growth in the AT&T Wireless  Group's  depreciable  asset base resulting
from  capital  expenditures  to increase the capacity of the network and improve
call quality as well as the acquisition of Vanguard  Cellular in May 1999. Total
capital  expenditures  were $1,291  million and $2,123 million for the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2000.

Other income

Other income primarily includes gains or losses on sales or exchanges of assets,
net equity earnings from investments,  intercompany  interest income on the note
receivable from AT&T, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Other
income for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, was $227 million
and $308 million, respectively. Other income for the three and six month periods
ended June 30,  1999,  was $140  million  and $184  million,  respectively.  The
increase  for the three and six  month  periods  ended  June 30,  2000,  was due
primarily  to  higher  gains on the  sales  of  assets  as well as  intercompany
interest income on the note receivable from AT&T of $67 million,  related to the
attribution  of $7.0  billion of initial  public  offering  proceeds to the AT&T
Wireless  Group.   Partially  offsetting  these  increases,  were  lower  equity
earnings  primarily as a result of increased  losses  associated  with affiliate
investments.

Interest expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest on intercompany debt due to AT&T
less interest  expense  capitalized.  Interest expense for the second quarter of
2000, was $18 million,  a decrease of $20 million,  or 51.6%,  compared with the
second  quarter  of 1999.  Interest  expense  for the first half of 2000 was $69
million,  a decrease of $1  million,  or 1.0%,  compared  with the first half of
1999.  The decrease  for the second  quarter of 2000,  compared  with the second
quarter of 1999, was due to higher levels of capitalized interest as a result of
increased capital  expenditures,  as well as lower levels of average outstanding
debt due to AT&T. The decrease in the average  outstanding  debt due to AT&T was
attributable  to the  recapitalization  of $2.0 billion of long term debt due to
AT&T  into 9%  cumulative  preferred  stock  subsequent  to the  initial  public
offering  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group  tracking  stock.  These  decreases  were
partially offset by a higher rate of interest  charged on the intercompany  debt
in the second quarter of 2000 versus the prior year quarter.  For the six months
ended June 30, 2000,  higher  levels of  outstanding  debt,  as well as a higher
interest rate, offset the increase in capitalized interest.
<PAGE>
Provision for income taxes

The  provision  for income taxes for the three and six month  periods ended June
30, 2000,  was $116 million and $146  million,  respectively,  compared with $43
million and $17 million for the same periods in 1999, respectively. The increase
in the  provision  for income taxes was due to higher income before income taxes
and a higher  effective tax rate.  The effective  income tax rates for the three
and six month  periods  ended June 30, 2000 were 36.9% and 39.3%,  respectively,
<PAGE>
compared with 35.5% and 35.3%, for the same periods in 1999,  respectively.  The
effective income tax rate for each of the 2000 periods presented was impacted by
the  amortization  of  intangibles  and  unutilized  equity  investment  losses,
partially  offset  by a  benefit  due to the  disposition  of an  equity  method
investment. The effective income tax rate for each of the 1999 periods presented
was impacted by the benefit from the change in the valuation allowance and other
estimates,  offset by  unutilized  foreign  equity  losses and  amortization  of
intangibles.

Dividend requirements on preferred stock held by AT&T

At June 30, 2000, and December 31, 1999, the AT&T Wireless Group had outstanding
$3.0 billion and $1.0  billion,  respectively,  of preferred  stock held by AT&T
that pays dividends at 9% per annum.  Intercompany  indebtedness of $2.0 billion
was  recapitalized  into an additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred
stock  following the initial  public  offering.  Dividend  requirements  on this
preferred  stock for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  were
$33 million and $46 million,  respectively, and for the corresponding periods in
1999 were $13 million and $27 million,  respectively, net of amounts recorded in
accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The continued expansion of the AT&T Wireless Group's network, footprint and
service offerings, and the marketing and distribution of its products and
services, will continue to require substantial capital.  The AT&T Wireless Group
has funded its operations by initial public  offering  proceeds  attributed from
AT&T,  intercompany borrowings from AT&T and internally generated funds, as well
as capital contributions from AT&T prior to the initial public offering. Capital
contributions   from  AT&T  prior  to  the  initial  public  offering   included
acquisitions  made by AT&T that have been attributed to the AT&T Wireless Group.
Noncash  capital  contributions  from AT&T to the AT&T Wireless Group related to
acquisitions  and initial  investments  funded by AT&T  totaled $539 million and
$1,662  million  for the six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2000  and  1999,
respectively.

The initial  public  offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking stock resulted
in net proceeds to AT&T after deducting  underwriter's discount and related fees
and expenses of $10.3 billion.  AT&T attributed $7.0 billion of the net proceeds
to the AT&T Wireless Group in the form of an intercompany  note receivable.  Net
transfers to and from the AT&T Wireless Group and AT&T subsequent to the initial
public offering are reflected as changes in the  intercompany  note  receivable.
After the attributed $7.0 billion of initial public offering  proceeds are fully
utilized,  AT&T  intends  to issue  short  term  floating  rate debt to the AT&T
Wireless Group.

On May 1, 2000,  following the initial public offering,  the AT&T Wireless Group
recapitalized $2.0 billion of outstanding intercompany indebtedness to AT&T into
an  additional  $2.0 billion of 9% cumulative  preferred  stock held by AT&T. In
conjunction with the recapitalization,  the AT&T Wireless Group's long term debt
due to AT&T was  recapitalized  to be 10 year term debt that bears interest at a
fixed rate of 8.1% per annum. AT&T has provided  financing at interest rates and
on terms and conditions  that are consistent  with those the AT&T Wireless Group
<PAGE>
would receive as a  stand-alone  entity.  Sources for the AT&T Wireless  Group's
future  financing  requirements  may include the  issuance  of  additional  AT&T
Wireless Group tracking stock and the borrowing of funds.

Financing  activities  for the AT&T  Wireless  Group  are  managed  by AT&T on a
centralized  basis and are  subject  to the  review of the AT&T  Wireless  Group
capital  stock  committee.  Loans from AT&T to any  member of the AT&T  Wireless
Group will be made at interest rates and on other terms and conditions  designed
to be  substantially  equivalent  to the  interest  rates  and  other  terms and
conditions  that the AT&T  Wireless  Group  would be able to obtain  from  third
parties,  including the public markets,  as a non-affiliate  of AT&T without the
benefit of any guaranty by AT&T. This policy  contemplates that these loans will
be made on the basis set forth above  regardless of the interest rates and other
terms and  conditions  on which AT&T may have acquired the funds.  If,  however,
AT&T incurs any fees or charges in order to keep available  funds for use by the
AT&T  Wireless  Group,  those  fees or  charges  will be  allocated  to the AT&T
Wireless Group.

Net cash  provided by  operating  activities  for the six months  ended June 30,
2000, was $223 million,  compared with $277 million for the same period in 1999.
The  decrease in cash  provided by operating  activities  was  primarily  due to
increases  in  inventories  and  accounts  receivable,  as well as a decrease in
accounts  payable,  partially offset by increased income excluding  depreciation
and amortization,  resulting from revenue growth and expense  leveraging for the
first  half of 2000  compared  with the  first  half of 1999.  Net cash  used in
investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2000, was $8,380 million,
compared with $600 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999.  The increase
was due primarily to the issuance of a note receivable  from AT&T,  acquisitions
of the Bay Area Properties and Wireless One, and higher capital  expenditures to
upgrade and increase  network  capacity in existing markets as well as to expand
the national  footprint.  Net cash provided by financing  activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2000, was $8,158  million,  compared with $411 million for
the six months  June 30,  1999.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to  proceeds
attributed  from the initial public offering of the AT&T Wireless Group tracking
stock and increased  transfers from AT&T prior to the initial public offering to
fund acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.

EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  is the  primary  measure  used by the  chief
operating  decision-makers to measure our ability to generate cash flow. EBITDA,
excluding  other  income,  defined as  operating  income plus  depreciation  and
amortization,  may or may not be consistent  with the  calculation of EBITDA for
other public  companies and should not be viewed by investors as an  alternative
to generally accepted accounting principles,  measures of performance or to cash
flows  from  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  as a measure  of
liquidity.

EBITDA,  excluding other income,  for the three and six month periods ended June
30, 2000,  was $509 million and $904 million,  respectively,  compared with $324
million and $513  million for the same  periods in 1999.  These  increases  were
attributable  to  increases  in total  revenue and an  improving  margin as SG&A
expenses  declined as a  percentage  of  revenues,  primarily  for our  mobility
business.

For our mobility business, EBITDA, excluding other income, for the three and six
month  periods  ended  June  30,  2000,  was  $550  million  and  $981  million,
respectively,  compared  with $347 million and $552 million for the same periods
in 1999.

For our fixed wireless business,  EBITDA,  excluding other income, for the three
and six month periods ended June 30, 2000,  was a deficit of $40 million and $74
million, respectively, compared with deficits of $17 million and $32 million for
the same periods in 1999.
<PAGE>
EBITDA,  excluding  other  income,  margins  were 20.5% and 19.3% for the second
quarter and first half of 2000, respectively,  compared with 17.3% and 14.9% for
the second  quarter and first half of, 1999,  respectively.  The  improvement in
EBITDA,  excluding other income, margins in the second quarter and first half of
2000  compared  with the  respective  periods  in 1999 was driven  primarily  by
revenue growth and expense leveraging,  primarily  off-network roaming expenses,
partially offset by increased  customer  acquisition and customer care costs, as
well as  higher  information  technology  costs  associated  with  growth in the
subscriber base.

EBITDA, excluding other income, margins for our mobility business were 22.2% and
21.0% for the second quarter and first half of 2000, respectively, compared with
18.5% and 16.0% for the second quarter and first half of 1999, respectively. The
improvement in EBITDA, excluding other income, margins in the second quarter and
first  half of 2000  compared  with the  respective  periods  in 1999 was driven
primarily by positive  EBITDA,  excluding  other income,  for the 1900 megahertz
markets for the three and six month periods  ended June 30, 2000,  compared with
losses  for the  respective  periods  in  1999,  as well  as  increased  EBITDA,
excluding other income, margins in the 850 megahertz markets.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Total  assets were $32,843  million as of June 30,  2000,  an increase of $9,331
million,  or 39.7%,  compared  with  December  31,  1999.  The  increase was due
primarily to the $7.0 billion of initial public offering proceeds  attributed to
the  AT&T  Wireless  Group  from  AT&T  in  the  form  of an  intercompany  note
receivable,   increases  in  goodwill,  licensing  costs,  property,  plant  and
equipment,  and other assets  associated  with the  acquisitions of the Bay Area
Properties  and Wireless One, and increased  property,  plant and equipment as a
result of significant capital spending in the first half of 2000.  Additionally,
non-consolidated investments increased as a result of the investment in American
Cellular during 2000,  partially  offset by the acquisition of the remaining 50%
interest in CMT Partners, which is now consolidated.

Total  liabilities were $8,310 million as of June 30, 2000, a decrease of $1,185
million,  or 12.5%,  compared with December 31, 1999. The decrease was primarily
due to  the  decrease  in  long  term  debt  due  to  AT&T  resulting  from  the
recapitalization  of the AT&T Wireless  Group  subsequent to the initial  public
offering,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  deferred  income  taxes,  other
long-term  liabilities,  and other current  liabilities.  Deferred incomes taxes
increased due to the deferred tax provision  recognized for the six months ended
June 30, 2000. Other long-term liabilities increased due to proceeds received in
consideration for a long-term leasing arrangement, and other current liabilities
increased due to increased business taxes and operating accruals.

Total  preferred  stock held by AT&T increased to $3.0 billion at June 30, 2000,
from $1.0  billion at December  31, 1999,  due to the  recapitalization  of $2.0
billion of  intercompany  debt into  preferred  stock  subsequent to the initial
public  offering.  Dividends  payable on the preferred stock were paid at 9% per
annum.

Total  equity was $24,522  million as of June 30,  2000,  an increase of $10,525
million,  or 75.2%,  compared with December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily
due to increased  combined  equity  associated  with the  attribution of initial
public  offering  proceeds to the AT&T Wireless  Group, as well as net transfers
from AT&T prior to the initial  public  offering to fund capital  expansion  and
acquisitions, and the additional $2.0 billion of preferred stock issued to AT&T.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December  1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) issued Staff
Accounting   Bulletin   (SAB)  No.  101,   "Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
<PAGE>
Statements".  SAB No. 101 provides  guidance on revenue  recognition,  including
service  activation fees, and certain related costs,  which requires adoption by
the end of fiscal year 2000. Management is currently assessing the impact of SAB
No. 101 to the combined results of operations and financial position of the AT&T
Wireless Group.

In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities".  Among other provisions,  it requires that
entities  recognize  all  derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  in the
<PAGE>
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those  derivatives
would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it
qualifies for hedge accounting.  The effective date of this standard was delayed
via the issuance of SFAS No. 137. The effective date for SFAS No. 133 is now for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  June  15,  2000,  though  earlier  adoption  is
encouraged and  retroactive  application  is  prohibited.  For the AT&T Wireless
Group,  this means that the  standard  must be adopted no later than  January 1,
2001.  Management  does not expect the  adoption  of this  standard  will have a
material impact on the AT&T Wireless  Group's  results of operations,  financial
position or cash flows.

In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and Certain  Hedging  Activities"  as an amendment to SFAS No. 133.
This  statement  provides  clarification  with regard to certain  implementation
issues  under SFAS No. 133 on specific  types of hedges.  It is not  expected to
have a material  impact on the AT&T  Wireless  Group's  results  of  operations,
financial position or cash flows.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On July 24, 2000, the AT&T Wireless  Group  announced it had signed a definitive
agreement with SBC  Communications  to acquire its Indianapolis  wireless system
for approximately $530 million in cash. The transaction has been approved by the
boards of directors of AT&T and SBC Communications,  however, remains subject to
certain  federal  regulatory  approvals  and is  expected to close by the end of
2000.
