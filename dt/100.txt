AMR CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
     been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
     and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of
     the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
     principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
     these financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal
     recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position,
     results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Results of
     operations for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative
     of results of operations for the entire year. The balance sheet at December
     31, 1999 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that
     date. The results of operations, cash flows and net assets for Sabre, Inc.
     (Sabre), AMR Services, AMR Combs and TeleService Resources have been
     reflected in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued
     operations (see Note 6 below), and accordingly, related information
     previously reported in the June 30, 1999 Form 10-Q has been restated. For
     further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
     footnotes thereto included in the AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company)
     Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999.

2.   Accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at June 30, 2000
     and December 31, 1999, was $7.7 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively.
     Accumulated amortization of equipment and property under capital leases at
     June 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999, was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion,
     respectively.

3.   As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included
     in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
     1999, the Miami International Airport Authority is currently remediating
     various environmental conditions at Miami International Airport (Airport)
     and funding the remediation costs through landing fee revenues. Future
     costs of the remediation effort may be borne by carriers operating at the
     Airport, including American Airlines, Inc. (American), a wholly-owned
     subsidiary of the Company, through increased landing fees and/or other
     charges. In addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at
     various other airport and non-airport locations. Management believes, after
     considering a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition of these
     environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the Company's
     consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
     Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on the Company's
     current assessments of the ultimate outcome and, accordingly, could
     increase or decrease as these assessments change.

4.   As of June 30, 2000, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
     aircraft: 69 Boeing 737-800s, 20 Boeing 757-200s, 15 Boeing 777-200IGWs, 87
     Embraer regional jets and 25 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of these
     aircraft extend through 2006. Payments for these aircraft will approximate
     $1.1 billion during the remainder of 2000, $2.3 billion in 2001, $650
     million in 2002 and an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in 2003
     through 2006.

5.   During 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with priceline.com
     Incorporated (priceline) whereby ticket inventory provided by the Company
     may be sold through priceline's e-commerce system. In conjunction with this
     agreement, the Company received warrants to purchase approximately 5.5
     million shares of priceline common stock. In the second quarter of 2000,
     the Company sold these warrants for proceeds of approximately $94 million,
     and recorded a pre-tax gain of $57 million ($36 million after-tax), which
     is included in Miscellaneous - net on the consolidated statements of
     operations.

6.   During the first quarter of 1999, the Company completed the sales of AMR
     Services, AMR Combs and TeleService Resources. As a result of these sales,
     the Company recorded a gain of approximately $64 million, net of income
     taxes of approximately $19 million.

     Effective after the close of business on March 15, 2000, AMR distributed
     0.722652 shares of Sabre Class A common stock for each share of AMR stock
     owned by AMR's shareholders. The record date for the dividend of Sabre
     stock was the close of business on March 1, 2000. In addition, on February
     18, 2000, Sabre paid a special one-time cash dividend of $675 million to
     shareholders of record of Sabre common stock at the close of business on
     February 15, 2000. Based upon its approximate 83 percent interest in Sabre,
     AMR received

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     approximately $559 million of this dividend. These funds will be used for
     general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of aircraft. The
     dividend of AMR's entire ownership interest in Sabre's common stock
     resulted in a reduction to AMR's retained earnings in March of 2000 equal
     to the carrying value of the Company's investment in Sabre on March 15,
     2000, which approximated $581 million. In addition, effective March 15,
     2000, the Company reduced the exercise price and increased the number of
     stock options and awards by approximately 18 million to offset the dilution
     to the holders, which occurred as a result of the spin-off. These changes
     were made to keep the holders in the same economic position as before the
     spin-off. This dilution adjustment was determined in accordance with
     Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 90-9, "Changes to Fixed Employee
     Stock Option Plans as a Result of Equity Restructuring," and accordingly,
     had no impact on earnings.

     The results of operations for Sabre, AMR Services, AMR Combs and
     TeleService Resources have been reflected in the consolidated statements of
     operations as discontinued operations. The net assets of Sabre of
     approximately $1.0 billion were classified in the condensed consolidated
     balance sheet as of December 31, 1999 in other assets. Other summarized
     financial information of the discontinued operations is as follows (in
     millions):

7.   In connection with a secondary offering by Equant N.V. in February 1999,
     the Company sold approximately 923,000 depository certificates for a
     pre-tax gain of $66 million ($37 million after-tax). Of this amount,
     approximately 489,000 depository certificates, or a pre-tax gain of $35
     million, related to depository certificates held by the Company on behalf
     of Sabre and is included in income from discontinued operations on the
     consolidated statements of operations. The remaining $31 million is
     included in Miscellaneous - net on the consolidated statements of
     operations.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999

SUMMARY AMR's income from continuing operations during the second quarter of
2000 was $321 million, or $1.96 per common share diluted, as compared to $216
million, or $1.36 per common share diluted, for the same period in 1999. AMR's
operating income of $517 million increased $103 million compared to the same
period in 1999. AMR's second quarter 2000 results include an approximate $36
million after-tax gain, or $0.21 per common share diluted, related to the sale
of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com
Incorporated (priceline) common stock.

The Company's REVENUES increased $470 million, or 10.4 percent, in the second
quarter of 2000 versus the same period last year. American's PASSENGER REVENUES
increased by 11.6 percent, or $435 million, compared to the second quarter of
1999. American's YIELD (the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile)
of 13.75 cents increased by 6.0 percent compared to the same period in 1999.
Domestic yields increased 5.5 percent from the second quarter of 1999.
International yields increased 7.2 percent, reflecting an increase of 12.3
percent, 9.9 percent and 4.3 percent in Pacific, Europe and Latin American
yields, respectively. The increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong
U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both domestically and
internationally, and a favorable pricing climate.

American's traffic or REVENUE PASSENGER MILES (RPMs) increased 5.3 percent to
30.4 billion miles for the quarter ended June 30, 2000. American's capacity or
AVAILABLE SEAT MILES (ASMs) decreased 0.8 percent to 40.1 billion miles in the
second quarter of 2000. American's domestic traffic increased 4.2 percent on a
capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 7.7 percent
on capacity increases of 3.5 percent. The decrease in domestic capacity was due
primarily to the Company's "More Room Throughout Coach" initiative. The increase
in international traffic was driven by a 10.1 percent increase in traffic to
Europe on capacity growth of 6.4 percent, a 9.7 percent increase in traffic to
the Pacific on a capacity increase of 0.8 percent and a 4.8 percent increase in
traffic to Latin America on capacity growth of 1.8 percent.

The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 8.9 percent, or $367 million.
American's cost per ASM increased 10.0 percent to 10.24 cents. WAGES, SALARIES
AND BENEFITS increased 7.2 percent, or $113 million, primarily due to an
increase in the average number of equivalent employees, contractual wage rate
and seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts and an
increase in the provision for profit-sharing. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense increased
37.0 percent, or $153 million, due to a 33.9 percent increase in the Company's
average price per gallon and a 2.5 percent increase in the Company's fuel
consumption. The increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $110
million recognized during the second quarter of 2000 related to the Company's
fuel hedging program. MAINTENANCE, MATERIALS AND REPAIRS increased $49 million,
or 22.0 percent, due primarily to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance
volumes at the Company's maintenance bases and an approximate $17 million
one-time credit the Company received in the second quarter of 1999. COMMISSIONS
TO AGENTS decreased 8.4 percent, or $25 million, despite an increase of
approximately 11.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit
from the international base commission structure change implemented in October
1999 and a decrease in commissionable transactions.

INTEREST INCOME increased approximately $17 million due primarily to higher
investment balances. INTEREST EXPENSE increased approximately $21 million, or
22.3 percent, due to an increase in long-term debt. INTEREST CAPITALIZED
increased 24.1 percent, or $7 million, due to an increase in purchase deposits
for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS - NET increased approximately $56 million
due primarily to the $57 million gain on sale of the Company's warrants to
purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000 AND 1999

SUMMARY AMR's income from continuing operations for the six months ended June
30, 2000 was $410 million, or $2.58 per common share diluted. This compares with
income from continuing operations of $233 million, or $1.45 per common share
diluted, for the same period in 1999. AMR's operating income of $729 million
increased 58.5 percent, or $269 million, compared to the same period in 1999.
AMR's 2000 results from continuing operations include an approximate $36 million
after-tax gain, or $0.22 per common share diluted, related to the sale of the
Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock.
AMR's 1999 results from continuing operations include a labor disagreement that
disrupted the Company's operations and negatively impacted the Company's 1999
net earnings by an estimated $140 million, or $0.87 per common share diluted,
partially offset by an approximate $19 million after-tax gain, or $0.12 per
common share diluted, related to the sale of a portion of American's holdings in
Equant, N.V. (Equant).

The Company's REVENUES increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 12.2 percent,
during the first six months of 2000 versus the same period last year. American's
PASSENGER REVENUES increased by 12.5 percent, or $885 million. American's YIELD
of 13.84 cents increased by 6.1 percent compared to the same period in 1999.
Domestic yields increased 5.8 percent from the first six months of 1999.
International yields increased 7.1 percent, reflecting an increase of 16.9
percent, 8.6 percent and 4.8 percent in Pacific, Europe and Latin American
yields, respectively. The increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong
U.S. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel both domestically and
internationally, and a favorable pricing climate. In addition, the first quarter
of 1999 includes a schedule disruption which impacted the Company's operations.

American's traffic or REVENUE PASSENGER MILES (RPMs) increased 6.0 percent to
57.4 billion miles for the six months ended June 30, 2000. American's capacity
or AVAILABLE SEAT MILES (ASMs) increased 2.6 percent to 80.1 billion miles in
the first six months of 2000. American's domestic traffic increased 4.8 percent
on capacity growth of 1.1 percent and international traffic increased 8.9
percent on capacity increases of 6.0 percent. The increase in domestic capacity
was due primarily to the addition of new aircraft, mostly offset by the
Company's "More Room Throughout Coach" initiative. The increase in international
traffic was driven by a 16.2 percent increase in traffic to the Pacific on
capacity growth of 5.2 percent, an 11.0 percent increase in traffic to Europe on
a capacity increase of 9.9 percent and a 5.6 percent increase in traffic to
Latin America on capacity growth of 3.2 percent.

AMR Eagle's passenger REVENUES increased 15.5 percent, or $95 million, due
primarily to the acquisition of Business Express, Inc. in March 1999.

Cargo REVENUES increased $38 million, or 12.3 percent, due primarily to a fuel
surcharge implemented in February 2000 and the Company's increase in cargo
capacity from the addition of new aircraft in late 1999 and 2000.

The Company's OPERATING EXPENSES increased 9.5 percent, or $771 million.
American's cost per ASM increased by 6.8 percent to 10.10 cents. WAGES, SALARIES
AND BENEFITS increased $263 million, or 8.7 percent, primarily due to an
increase in the average number of equivalent employees, contractual wage rate
and seniority increases that are built into the Company's labor contracts and an
increase in the provision for profit-sharing. AIRCRAFT FUEL expense increased
46.8 percent, or $357 million, due to a 40.4 percent increase in the Company's
average price per gallon and a 4.9 percent increase in the Company's fuel
consumption. The increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately $232
million recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2000 related to the
Company's fuel hedging program. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION expense increased
$61 million, or 11.7 percent, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft.
MAINTENANCE, MATERIALS AND REPAIRS expense increased 13.1 percent, or $63
million, due primarily to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance volumes
at the Company's maintenance bases and an approximate $17 million one-time
credit the Company received in the second quarter of 1999. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS
decreased 9.6 percent, or $56 million, despite an increase of approximately 12.8
percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the benefit from the
international base commission structure change implemented in October 1999 and a
decrease in commissionable transactions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

INTEREST INCOME increased approximately 61.0 percent, or $25 million, due
primarily to higher investment balances. INTEREST EXPENSE increased
approximately $47 million, or 25.1 percent, due to an increase in long-term
debt. INTEREST CAPITALIZED increased 19.4 percent, or $12 million, due to an
increase in purchase deposits for flight equipment. MISCELLANEOUS - NET
increased approximately 83.3 percent, or $20 million, due primarily to the gain
on sale of the Company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline
common stock in the second quarter of 2000, which resulted in a $57 million
gain. In the first quarter of 1999, the Company recorded an approximate $31
million gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's interest in Equant.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES in the six-month period ended June 30,
2000 was $1.8 billion, an increase of $693 million over the same period in 1999.
This increase resulted primarily from an increase in the air traffic liability
due to higher advanced sales and an increase in income from continuing
operations. Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2000 were $1.9
billion, and included the acquisition of 11 Boeing 777-200IGWs, 12 Boeing
737-800s, 11 Embraer 135 aircraft and five Embraer 145 aircraft. These capital
expenditures were financed with internally generated cash and the $559 million
of cash received from the Sabre dividend, except for the Embraer aircraft
acquisitions which were funded through secured debt agreements.

     As of June 30, 2000, the Company had commitments to acquire the following
aircraft: 69 Boeing 737-800s, 20 Boeing 757-200s, 15 Boeing 777-200IGWs, 87
Embraer regional jets and 25 Bombardier CRJ-700s. Deliveries of these aircraft
extend through 2006. Payments for these aircraft will approximate $1.1 billion
during the remainder of 2000, $2.3 billion in 2001, $650 million in 2002 and an
aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006. The Company
expects to fund its remaining 2000 capital expenditures from the Company's
existing cash and short-term investments, internally generated cash, and new
financing depending upon capital market conditions and the Company's evolving
view of its long-term needs.

OTHER INFORMATION

DALLAS LOVE FIELD

In 1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of Fort Worth and Dallas to
build and operate Dallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW), a bond ordinance was enacted
by both cities (the Bond Ordinance). The Bond Ordinance required both cities to
direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to DFW and was an integral
part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of DFW. In 1979, as
part of a settlement to resolve litigation with Southwest Airlines, the cities
agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the Bond Ordinance at
Dallas' Love Field. Congress enacted the Wright Amendment to prevent the federal
government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. The Wright Amendment
limited interstate operations at Love Field to the four states contiguous to
Texas (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) and prohibited through
ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. In 1997, without the
consent of either city, Congress amended the Wright Amendment by (i) adding
three states (Kansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) to the perimeter and (ii)
removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or
less (the 1997 Amendment).

     In October 1997, the City of Fort Worth filed suit in state district court
against the City of Dallas and others seeking to enforce the Bond Ordinance.
Fort Worth contended that the 1997 Amendment does not preclude the City of
Dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at Love Field
in a manner consistent with the Bond Ordinance and, moreover, that Dallas has an
obligation to do so. American joined in this litigation. On October 15, 1998,
the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of American and Fort
Worth. On May 25, 2000, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals overturned the district
court order and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted by federal law.
American and Fort Worth filed motions asking the Fort Worth Court of Appeals to
reconsider its decision. In the same lawsuit, DFW filed claims alleging that
irrespective of whether the Bond Ordinance was enforceable, the DFW Use
Agreement prohibited American and other DFW signatory airlines from moving any
interstate operations to Love Field.

     Dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking to
have the court declare that, as a matter of law, the 1997 Amendment precludes
the City of Dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at Love Field.
Further, in May 1998, Continental Airlines and Continental Express filed a
lawsuit in Dallas federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the Bond
Ordinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from Love
Field to Cleveland using regional jets. These two federal court lawsuits were
consolidated and stayed.

     In December 1998, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued an order on
the federal law questions concerning the Bond Ordinance, local proprietary
powers, DFW's Use Agreement with DFW carriers such as American, and the Wright
and 1997 Amendments, and concluded that the Bond Ordinance was preempted by
federal law and was therefore not enforceable. The DOT also found that the DFW
Use Agreement did not preclude American from conducting interstate operations at
Love Field. Fort Worth, American and DFW appealed the DOT's order to the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals, and on February 1, 2000, the Fifth Circuit affirmed
the DOT's order in all respects. American, Fort Worth and DFW each filed
petitions for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which
were denied on June 29, 2000. Shortly thereafter, American, Fort Worth and DFW
dismissed all remaining motions and claims in the Texas state court litigation.
Consequently, litigation over the right to provide scheduled passenger
operations at Love Field on aircraft with fewer than 57 seats to destinations
beyond the Wright Amendment perimeter has ended.

     In January 2000, the Department of Justice, at the behest of the DOT, filed
a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas, Dallas Division, against Fort Worth and American seeking to enforce the
DOT's order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operating
under that order.

     On May 1, 2000, American commenced service from Love Field to Chicago and
Los Angeles using terminal space leased from Continental Express on a short-term
basis. American has further announced that it will offer service from Love Field
to New York's LaGuardia airport commencing August 31, 2000. American is seeking
long-term facilities at Love Field from the City of Dallas for its Love Field
operations. As a result of the foregoing, an increase in operations at Love
Field and/or the inability of American to obtain adequate facilities to compete
effectively at Love Field could adversely impact American's business.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION

Two competitors of the Company, UAL Corporation and US Airways Group, Inc.,
recently announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. If
that merger were to be consummated or other significant consolidation were to
occur in the airline industry, conditions and competition in the industry could
be significantly altered. If the Company were involved in a business combination
with a competitor, the financial condition and prospects of the resulting
corporation could be materially different from those of the Company.

                           PART II: OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In connection with its frequent flyer program, American was sued in several
purported class action cases currently pending in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois. In Wolens et al. v. American Airlines, Inc. and Tucker v.
American Airlines, Inc. (hereafter, "Wolens"), plaintiffs seek money damages and
attorneys' fees claiming that a change made to American's AAdvantage program in
May 1988, which limited the number of seats available to participants travelling
on certain awards, breached American's agreement with its AAdvantage members.
(Although the Wolens complaint originally asserted several state law claims,
only the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted the other claims). In
Gutterman et al. v. American Airlines, Inc. (hereafter, "Gutterman"), plaintiffs
also seek money damages and attorneys' fees claiming that the February 1995
increase in the award mileage required to claim a certain AAdvantage travel
award breached the agreement between American and its AAdvantage members. On
June 23, 1998, the court certified the Gutterman case as a class action.

     In February 2000, American and the Wolens and Gutterman plaintiffs reached
a settlement of both lawsuits. Pursuant to the agreement, American and the
plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to consolidate the Wolens and Gutterman
lawsuits for purposes of settlement. Further, American and the Wolens plaintiffs
agreed to ask the court to certify a Wolens class of AAdvantage members who had
at least 35,000 unredeemed AAdvantage miles as of December 31, 1988. In
addition, American and the Gutterman plaintiffs agreed to ask the court to
decertify the existing Gutterman class and to certify a new Gutterman class of
AAdvantage members who as of December 31, 1993 (a) had redeemed 25,000 or 50,000
AAdvantage miles for certain AAdvantage awards and/or (b) had between 4,700 and
24,999 unredeemed miles in his or her account that were earned in 1992 or 1993.
Depending upon certain factors, Wolens and Gutterman class members will be
entitled to receive certificates entitling them to mileage off certain
AAdvantage awards or dollars off certain American fares.

     As part of the settlement, American agreed to pay the Wolens and Gutterman
plaintiffs' attorneys and the cost of administering the settlement, which
amounts were accrued as of December 31, 1999. In consideration for the relief
provided in the settlement agreement, Wolens and Gutterman class members will
release American from all claims arising from any changes that American has made
to the AAdvantage program and reaffirming American's right to make changes to
the AAdvantage program in the future. On May 2, 2000, the court preliminarily
approved the settlement and authorized sending notice of the settlement to class
members. Before the settlement can become effective, the court must give final
approval of the settlement agreement after providing any objectors an
opportunity to be heard.

     On August 7, 1998, a purported class action was filed against American
Airlines in state court in Travis County, Texas (Boon Ins. Agency v. American
Airlines, Inc., et al.) claiming that the $75 reissuance fee for changes to
non-refundable tickets is an unenforceable liquidated damages clause and seeking
a refund of the fee on behalf of passengers who paid it, as well as interest and
attorneys' fees. On September 23, 1998, Continental, Delta, and America West
were added as defendants to the lawsuit. On February 2, 1999, prior to any
discovery being taken and a class being certified, the court granted the
defendants' motion for summary judgment holding that plaintiff's claims are
preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act. Plaintiff has filed an appeal of the
dismissal of the lawsuit. On March 30, 2000, the Texas Court of Appeals in
Austin affirmed the granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment. The
plaintiff is seeking review by the Supreme Court of Texas. American is
vigorously defending all claims against it.

                                     PART II


ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

     On May 20, 1999, several class action lawsuits filed against the Allied
Pilots Association (APA) seeking compensation for passengers and cargo shippers
adversely affected by a labor disagreement that disrupted operations in February
1999 were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas, Dallas Division (In re Allied Pilots Association Class Action
Litigation). Plaintiffs are not seeking to hold American independently liable.
Instead, Plaintiffs named American as a defendant because American has a $45.5
million judgment against the APA. APA filed cross claims against American in one
of the cases now consolidated in the Northern District of Texas alleging that
American must indemnify pilots who put themselves on the sick list. APA also
filed a motion to dismiss all claims against it. A United States District Court
Magistrate recommended that the court dismiss all the claims in the lawsuit,
concluding that certain claims are preempted by federal law and that certain
other claims should be brought in state court, rather than federal court. The
Magistrate's recommendations are pending before the court. On July 24, 2000,
American announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the APA that
would modify the existing labor contract between American and the APA which, if
approved by the APA membership, will resolve among other issues American's $45.5
million judgment against the APA. If this agreement is approved, it may impact
claims against American in this litigation. In the meanwhile, American is
vigorously defending all claims against it.

     On July 26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in November 1999 an
amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc.,
AMR Eagle Holding Corporation, Airlines Reporting Corporation, and the Sabre
Group Holdings, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, Western Division (Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR
Corp., et al.). The lawsuit alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit
memos to American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American and
American Eagle and plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment, and (3)
violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO).
The as yet uncertified class includes all travel agencies who have been or will
be required to pay monies to American for debit memos for fare rules violations
from July 26, 1995 to the present. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from
enforcing the pricing rules in question and to recover the amounts paid for
debit memos, plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. Defendants' motion
to dismiss all claims is pending. American intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit.

     On May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR
Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The lawsuit
alleges that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) by
increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. The Department of Justice seeks to enjoin American
from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on
American to remedy the alleged effects of its past conduct. American intends to
defend the lawsuit vigorously.

     Between May 14, 1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action lawsuits were
filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and AMR Eagle Holding
Corporation in the United States District Court in Wichita, Kansas seeking
treble damages under federal and state antitrust laws, as well as injunctive
relief and attorneys' fees. (King v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et
al.; Team Electric v. AMR Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp.,
et al.). Collectively, these lawsuits allege that American unlawfully
monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline passenger service to and from DFW
by increasing service when new competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching
these new competitors' fares. Two of the suits (Smith and Wright) also allege
that American unlawfully monopolized or attempted to monopolize airline
passenger service to and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate
purchasers, by offering a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions
on the use and availability of certain fares, and by offering override
commissions to travel agents. The suits propose to certify several classes of
consumers, the broadest of which is all persons who purchased tickets for air
travel on American into or out of DFW since 1995 to the present. On November 10,
1999, the District Court stayed all of these actions pending developments in the
case brought by the Department of Justice. As a result, to date no class has
been certified. American intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

     On March 1, 2000, American was served with a federal grand jury subpoena
calling for American to produce documents relating to de-icing operations at DFW
since 1992. American is not able at this time to determine either the full scope
of the grand jury's investigation or American's role in the investigation.
American intends to fully cooperate with the government's investigation.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

The owners of 134,113,443 shares of common stock, or 90 percent of shares
