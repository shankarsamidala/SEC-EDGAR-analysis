  financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the AMR Annual
  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (2002 Form
  10-K). Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003
  presentation.

  The   Company's  Regional  Affiliates  include  two   wholly   owned
  subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive  Airlines,
  Inc.  (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent carriers, Trans
  States  Airlines, Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua Airlines,  Inc.
  (Chautauqua).  For the six months ended June 30, 2002, American  had
  a  fee  per block hour agreement with Chautauqua and  revenue
  prorate  agreements  with  AMR Eagle and  Trans  States.   Effective
  January  1, 2003, American converted the AMR Eagle carriers  from  a
  revenue  prorate agreement to a fee per block hour agreement.   This
  change  does  not  have  any  impact on the  Company's  consolidated
  financial  statements, but has changed the results of the  Company's
  wholly  owned  subsidiaries on an individual  basis.   For  the  six
  months  ended June 30, 2003, American also had fee  per  block
  hour agreements with Trans States and Chautauqua.

2.In  February  2003,  American  asked its  labor  leaders  and  other
  employees  for approximately $1.8 billion in annual savings  through
  a  combination  of changes in wages, benefits and work  rules.   The
  requested  $1.8  billion in savings was divided  by  work  group  as
  follows:   $660  million  -  pilots; $620 million  -  Transportation
  Workers   Union  represented  employees;  $340  million   -   flight
  attendants;  $100 million - management and support  staff;  and  $80
  million  - agents and representatives.  References in this  document
  to   American's  three  major  unions  include:  the  Allied  Pilots
  Association (the APA); the Transportation Workers Union  (the  TWU);
  and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA).

  On   March  31,  2003,  American  announced  that  it  had   reached
  agreements  with its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).   It
  also reported various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-
  unionized  personnel  including officers and other  management  (the
  Management  Reductions).  The anticipated cost savings arising  from
  the  Labor Agreements and the Management Reductions met the targeted
  annual savings of $1.8 billion.

  On  April  24,  2003  and  April 25, 2003, the  three  major  unions
  certified  the  ratification  of  the  Labor  Agreements  with  some
  modifications  (the  Modified  Labor  Agreements).   The   principal
  modifications  were a shorter duration and the ability  to  initiate
  the  process  of re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements  after
  three  years.  Even  with these modifications,  the  Modified  Labor
  Agreements continue to meet the targeted annual savings.

  Of  the  approximately  $1.8  billion in estimated  annual  savings,
  approximately  $1.0  billion relate to wage and  benefit  reductions
  while  the  remaining approximately $.8 billion is  expected  to  be
  accomplished  through changes in work rules, which  will  result  in
  additional  job  reductions.  As a result of  these  additional  job
  reductions,  the  Company incurred $60 million in severance  charges
  in   the   second  quarter  of  2003  (see  Note  5  for  additional
  information). Wage reductions became effective on April 1, 2003  for
  officers  and  May  1,  2003  for all other  employees.   Reductions
  related  to  benefits and work rule changes will be phased  in  over
  time.  In  connection with the changes in wages, benefits  and  work
  rules,  the Company granted approximately 38 million shares  of  AMR
  stock  to  American's employees in the form of stock  options  which
  will vest over a three year period with an exercise price of $5  per
  share  (see Note 12 for additional information).

  In  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of the Modified  Labor
  Agreements,   the   Company  and  American   reached   concessionary
  agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders (see Notes  9  and
  13  for  additional  information) and suppliers  (collectively,  the
  Vendors,  and  the  agreements, the Vendor Agreements).   Generally,
  under  the terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company or  American
  will  receive  the  benefit of lower rates and charges  for  certain
  goods  and  services,  and more favorable rent and  financing  terms
  with  respect  to  certain  of its aircraft.  In  return  for  these
  concessions, the Company anticipates that it will issue - over  time
  -  up to 3.0 million shares of AMR's common stock to Vendors.  As of
  June 30, 2003, approximately 2.2 million shares have been issued  to
  Vendors.

  The  Company's  revenue environment has improved during  the  second
  quarter of 2003 as reflected in improved unit revenues (revenue  per
  available  seat  mile)  in  May  and  June  2003.  Even  with   this
  improvement  however,  the Company's revenues  are  still  depressed
  relative  to historical levels and the Company's recent losses  have
  adversely  affected its financial condition. The  Company  therefore
  needs  to  see  continued improvement in the revenue environment  to
  return it to sustained profitability at acceptable levels.

  To  maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company implements its plan
  to   return  to  sustained  profitability,  the  Company  will  need
  continued  access  to  additional funding,  most  likely  through  a
  combination  of  financings  and  asset  sales.   In  addition,  the
  Company's  ability to return to sustained profitability will  depend
  on  a  number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond  the
  Company's  control.  Among other things, the following factors  have
  had  and/or may have a negative impact on the Company's business and
  financial   results:    the   uncertain   financial   and   business
  environment  the  Company faces, the struggling economy,  high  fuel
  prices  and  the availability of fuel, the residual effects  of  the
  war  in Iraq, conflicts in the Middle East, the residual effects  of
  the  SARS  outbreak, historically low fare levels,  the  competitive
  environment,   uncertainties   with   respect   to   the   Company's
  international operations, changes in its business strategy,  actions
  by  U.S. or foreign government agencies, the possible occurrence  of
  additional  terrorist attacks, or the inability of  the  Company  to
  satisfy  existing  liquidity  requirements  or  other  covenants  in
  certain  of  its  credit arrangements (see Note  13  for  additional
  information).   In   particular,   if   the   revenue    environment
  deteriorates  beyond  normal seasonal  trends,  or  the  Company  is
  unable  to  access  the capital markets or sell assets,  it  may  be
  unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.

3.The  Company  accounts  for its stock-based  compensation  plans  in
  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion   No.   25,
  "Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees" (APB  25)  and  related
  Interpretations.    Under  APB  25,  no  compensation   expense   is

4.In   April   2003,  the  President  signed  the  Emergency   Wartime
  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act, 2003  (the  Act)  which  includes
  aviation-related  assistance provisions. The Act authorized  payment
  of  (i) $100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs
  associated  with  the strengthening of flight deck doors  and  locks
  and  (ii)  $2.3  billion  to reimburse air  carriers  for  increased
  security  costs which was distributed in proportion to  the  amounts
  each  carrier  had paid or collected in passenger security  and  air
  carrier  security fees to the Transportation Security Administration
  as  of  the  Act's  enactment (the Security Fee Reimbursement).   In
  addition, the Act suspends the collection of the passenger  security
  fee  from  June  1,  2003 until October 1, 2003 and  authorizes  the
  extension  of  war-risk  insurance  through  August  31,  2004  (and
  permits  further extensions until December 31, 2004).  The Act  also
  limits   the  total  cash  compensation  for  the  two  most  highly
  compensated  named executive officers in 2002 for certain  airlines,
  including the Company, during the period April 1, 2003 to  April  1,
  2004  to  the amount of salary received by such officers,  or  their
  successors,  in  2002.   A violation of this executive  compensation
  provision would require the carrier to repay the government for  the
  amount  of  the  Security Fee Reimbursement. The  Company  does  not
  anticipate  any  difficulties in complying with this  limitation  on
  executive  compensation and believes the likelihood of repaying  the
  government  for  the  amount of the Security  Fee  Reimbursement  is
  remote.  The  Company's Security Fee Reimbursement was $358  million
  (net  of  payments  to  independent  regional  affiliates)  and  was
  recorded  as  a  reduction to operating expenses during  the  second
  quarter  of  2003. The Company's compensation for the  direct  costs
  associated with strengthening flight deck doors will be recorded  as
  a  reduction  to  capitalized flight equipment as such  amounts  are
  received.

5.During the last two years, as a result of the events of September 11,
  2001 and subsequent related activities, the Company has recorded a
  number of Special charges.  In 2003, the Company recorded additional
  Special charges and other charges as discussed below:

  Aircraft Charges

  In  the  second quarter of 2003, the Company determined that certain
  accruals   for  future  lease  return  and  other  costs,  initially
  recorded  as  a  component of Special charges  in  the  consolidated
  statement  of  operations were no longer necessary.  In  the  second
  quarter  of  2003, the Company recorded a $20 million  reduction  to
  Special charges to finalize these accruals.

  Employee Charges

  In  the  first  quarter of 2003, as a part of its 2002 restructuring
  initiatives,  the Company incurred $25 million in severance  charges
  which  are included in Special charges in the consolidated statement
  of operations.

  The  Company estimates that it will reduce approximately 8,000  jobs
  by  June 2004 in conjunction with the Management Reductions and  the
  Modified  Labor  Agreements discussed in Note 2. This  reduction  in
  workforce,  which  will  affect  all  work  groups  (pilots,  flight
  attendants, mechanics, fleet service clerks, agents, management  and
  support  staff  personnel),  has  been  and  will  continue  to   be
  accomplished  through  various measures,  including  part-time  work
  schedules,   furloughs  in  accordance  with  collective  bargaining
  agreements,  and permanent layoffs.  As a result of  this  reduction
  in  workforce,  during  the  second quarter  of  2003,  the  Company
  recorded  an employee charge of approximately $60 million, primarily
  for  severance related costs, which is included in Special  charges.
  Cash  outlays for the $60 million employee charge will  be  incurred
  over a period of up to twelve months.

  Also  in  conjunction  with the Modified Labor  Agreements  and  the
  Management  Reductions,  during the  second  quarter  of  2003,  the
  Company  reduced its vacation accrual by $85 million to reflect  new
  lower pay scales and maximum vacation caps, which was recorded as  a
  reduction to Special charges.

  In  connection  with  the  Modified Labor  Agreements,  the  Company
  agreed to forgive a $26 million receivable from one its three  major
  unions.  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company  recorded  a
  $26 million Special charge to write-off the receivable.

  In  addition,  as  discussed in Note 6,  the  Company  recognized  a
  curtailment  loss  of  $46 million related to  its  defined  benefit
  pension plans.

  Facility Exit Costs

  In  the  second quarter of 2003, the Company determined that certain
  excess  airport space will not be used by the Company in the future.
  As  a  result, the Company recorded a $45 million charge,  primarily
  related to the fair value of future lease commitments and the write-
  off  of certain prepaid rental amounts.  Cash outlays related to the
  accrual  of  future lease commitments will occur over the  remaining
  lease term, which extends through 2017.

  Other

  On  July  16,  2003, the Company announced that it will  reduce  the
  size  of  its St. Louis hub, effective November 1, 2003,  and  close
  its  St.  Louis reservations office, effective September  15,  2003.
  As  a  result  of these actions, the Company expects to record  some
  additional  charges  in  the  third and  fourth  quarters  of  2003.
  Although the Company cannot estimate the amount of these charges  at
  the  time  of  the  filing of this Form 10-Q, they are  expected  to
  include  employee  severance  and benefits  charges,  facility  exit
  costs and aircraft charges.

6.In the second quarter of 2003, as a result of the Modified Labor
  Agreements and Management Reductions discussed in Note 2, the Company
  remeasured  its  defined  benefit pension  plans.   The  significant
  actuarial  assumptions used for the remeasurement were the  same  as
  those used as of December 31, 2002 except for the discount rate  and
  salary  scale, which were lowered to 6.50 percent, and 2.78  percent
  through   2008  and  3.78  thereafter,  respectively.  In  addition,
  assumptions with respect to interest rates used to discount lump sum
  benefit  payments  available under certain plans  were  updated.  In
  conjunction with the remeasurement, the Company recorded an increase
  in its minimum pension liability, primarily due to changes in discount
  rates, which resulted in an additional charge to stockholders' equity
  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  loss  of  $334  million.
  Furthermore,  as  a result of workforce reductions  related  to  the
  Modified  Labor  Agreements and Management Reductions,  the  Company
  recognized a curtailment loss of $46 million related to its  defined
  benefit  pension  plans, in accordance with Statement  of  Financial
  Accounting  Standards No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements
  and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
  Benefits"  (SFAS 88), which is included in Special  charges  in  the
  consolidated statement of operations.

  The  following  table provides a statement of funded  status  as  of
  April  22,  2003  and  December 31, 2002 for the  Company's  defined
  benefit pension plans (in millions):

7.The  Company has restricted cash and short-term investments  related
  to  projected  workers' compensation obligations and  various  other
  obligations.  As  of June 30, 2003, projected workers'  compensation
  obligations   were  secured  by  restricted  cash   and   short-term
  investments  of  $387  million and various  other  obligations  were
  secured  by  restricted  cash  and short-term  investments  of  $163
  million.  In  the first quarter of 2003, the Company  redeemed  $339
  million  of tax-exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters  of
  credit   secured  by  restricted  cash  and  short-term  investments
  resulting   in  a  reduction  in  restricted  cash  and   short-term
  investments.  Of  the  $339 million of tax-exempt  bonds  that  were
  redeemed,  $253  million  were accounted for  as  operating  leases.
  Payments  to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenue  bonds
  are  generally considered prepaid facility rentals and  will  reduce
  future  operating lease commitments.  The remaining $86  million  of
  tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as  debt  and
  had original maturities in 2014 through 2024.

  As  of  June 30, 2003 the Company had approximately $221 million  in
  fuel  prepayments  and credit card holdback deposits  classified  as
  Other  current assets and Other assets in the condensed consolidated
  balance sheet.

  In  June  2003,  the  Company  sold its  interest  in  Worldspan,  a
  computer  reservations company, for $180 million in cash and  a  $39
  million  promissory note, resulting in a gain of $17  million  which
  is  included in Other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of
  operations.

8.As  of  June  30, 2003, the Company had commitments to  acquire  the
  following aircraft: two Boeing 767-300ERs, 12 Embraer regional  jets
  and  seven  Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate of 74  Embraer
  regional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through 2006;  and
  an  aggregate  of 47 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing  777-200ERs  in
  2006 through 2010.  Future payments for all aircraft, including  the
  estimated  amounts  for  price  escalation,  will  approximate  $407
  million  during the remainder of 2003, $755 million  in  2004,  $711
  million  in  2005 and an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion  in
  2006  through 2010. Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed to provide
  backstop  financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003.   In
  return,  American has granted Boeing a security interest in  certain
  advance  payments  previously made and in certain rights  under  the
  aircraft  purchase  agreement  between  American  and  Boeing.    In
  addition,  the  Company  has  pre-arranged  financing  or   backstop
  financing  for  all  of  its 2003 Embraer  and  Bombardier  aircraft
  deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries.

  As  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
  included  in  the  Company's 2002 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade  County  is
  currently   investigating  and  remediating  various  environmental
  conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the
  remediation  costs through landing fees and various  cost  recovery
  methods.   American  and AMR Eagle have been named  as  potentially
  responsible  parties (PRPs) for the contamination at  MIA.   During
  the  second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against  17
  defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover  its  past
  and  future  cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida  v.  Advance
  Cargo  Services,  Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit  Court).   In
  addition  to  the  17  defendants named in the lawsuit,  243  other
  agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors  to
  the  contamination.   American's and AMR  Eagle's  portion  of  the
  cleanup  costs  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  due  to  various
  factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions  that
  may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be
  recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding
  the  environmental  agencies  that will  ultimately  supervise  the
  remedial  activities  and  the  nature  of  that  supervision.   In
  addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at various
  other  airport and non-airport locations for which it  has  accrued
  $87   million  at  June  30,  2003.   Management  believes,   after
  considering  a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition  of
  these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the
  Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or
  cash flows.  Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on
  the  Company's  current  assessments of the ultimate  outcome  and,
  accordingly,  could  increase  or  decrease  as  these  assessments
  change.

9.As   discussed   in  Note  2,  the  Company  reached  concessionary
  agreements with certain lessors.  The Vendor Agreements with  these
  lessors affected the payments, lease term, and other conditions  of
  certain  leases.  As a result of these changes to the  payment  and
  lease  terms,  30  leases which were previously  accounted  for  as
  operating  leases were converted to capital leases, and  one  lease
  which was previously accounted for as a capital lease was converted
  to  an  operating lease.  The remaining leases did not change  from
  their  original  classification.   The  Company  recorded  the  new
  capital  leases  at the fair value of the respective  assets  being
  leased.  These  changes did not have a significant  effect  on  the
  Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.

  In  addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide  that
  the  Company's  obligations under the related lease revert  to  the
  original terms if certain events occur prior to December 31,  2005,
  including:  (i) an event of default under the related lease  (which
  generally occurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii)  an  event
  of  loss  with respect to the related aircraft, (iii) rejection  by
  the  Company of the lease under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the
  U.S.  Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company's filing  for  bankruptcy
  under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  If any one of these events
  were  to  occur, the Company would be responsible for approximately
  $11 million in additional lease payments as of June 30, 2003.  This
  amount will increase to $230 million prior to the expiration of the
  provision on December 31, 2005.  Such amounts are being treated  as
  contingent rentals and will only be recognized if they become due.

  The  future  minimum lease payments required under  capital  leases,
  together  with  the  present  value of  such  payments,  and  future
  minimum  lease  payments required under operating leases  that  have
  initial  or  remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess  of  one
  year  as  of  June  30, 2003 were as follows (these amounts  reflect
  concessions as a result of the Vendor Agreements):

  At  June 30, 2003, the Company had 261 jet aircraft and 30 turboprop
  aircraft  under  operating  leases  and  99  jet  aircraft  and   55
  turboprop  aircraft  under  capital leases  -  which  includes  both
  operating  and  non-operating aircraft.   The  aircraft  leases  can
  generally be renewed at rates based on fair market value at the  end
  of  the lease term for one to five years.  Some aircraft leases have
  purchase  options  at  or near the end of the  lease  term  at  fair
  market  value,  but generally not to exceed a stated  percentage  of
  the  defined  lessor's cost of the aircraft or  at  a  predetermined
  fixed amount.

10.Accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and property  at  June
  30,  2003  and December 31, 2002 was $8.8 billion and $8.4  billion,
  respectively.   Accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital  leases at June 30, 2003 and December  31,  2002  was
  $1.0 billion and $974 million, respectively.

11.The Company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as
  a  result generated certain net operating losses available to offset
  future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,
  a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the
  Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company
  provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
  likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets
  will not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record a
  valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results
  in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge
  to  Accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the  minimum
  pension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note  6.  The  Company's
  deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased $533 million in 2003,
  to $903 million as of June 30, 2003.

12.In  March  2003,  the Board of Directors of AMR  approved  the
  issuance  of additional shares of AMR common stock to employees  and
  Vendors   in   connection   with  ongoing  negotiations   concerning
  concessions.  The maximum number of shares authorized  for  issuance
  was  30  percent  of  the number of shares of the  Company's  common
  stock  outstanding on March 24, 2003 (156,359,955) or  approximately
  46.9  million shares. From the foregoing authorization, the  Company
  expects  to issue up to 3.0 million shares to Vendors.  As  of  June
  30,  2003,  approximately 2.2 million shares  have  been  issued  to
  Vendors,  from treasury stock, at an average price of $4.81  on  the
  date  of  grant resulting in a re-allocation from Treasury stock  to
  Additional  paid-in capital of $128 million.  Also  in  March  2003,
  the   AMR  Board  of  Directors  adopted  the  2003  Employee  Stock
  Incentive Plan (2003 Plan) to provide equity awards to employees  in
  connection with wage, benefit and work rule concessions.  Under  the
  2003  Plan,  all  American employees are eligible to  receive  stock
  awards  which  may  include  stock  options,  restricted  stock  and
  deferred   stock.   In  April  2003,  the  Company   reached   final
  agreements  with  the  unions representing American  employees  (the
  Modified  Labor  Agreements, see Note 2).  In  connection  with  the
  changes  in  wages,  benefits and work  rules,  the  Modified  Labor
  Agreements provide for the issuance of up to 37.9 million shares  of
  AMR  stock in the form of stock options. Approximately 37.9  million
  stock  options  were granted to employees at an  exercise  price  of
  $5.00  per  share,  which  is equal to the closing  price  of  AMR's
  common stock (NYSE) on April 17, 2003.  These shares will vest  over
  a  three-year  period  and  will expire on  April  17,  2013.  These
  options  were  granted to members of the APA,  the  TWU,  the  APFA,
  agents,   other  non-management  personnel  and  certain  management
  employees.

13.During the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, American  and
  AMR  Eagle  borrowed approximately $641 million under  various  debt
  agreements  which  are secured by aircraft.  These  agreements  have
  effective  interest  rates  which are fixed  or  variable  based  on
  London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread and mature  over
  various  periods  of time through 2019.  As of June  30,  2003,  the
  effective  interest  rate  on these agreements  ranged  up  to  8.81
  percent.

  In  July  2003,  American issued $255 million of enhanced  equipment
  trust  certificates,  secured by aircraft, which  bear  interest  at
  3.86   percent   and  are  repayable  in  semi-annual   installments
  beginning   in  2004,  with  a  final  maturity  in   2010.    These
  obligations are insured by a third party.

  As  part  of  the  Vendor Agreements discussed in Note  2,  American
  entered  into an agreement to transfer 33 Fokker 100 aircraft  (with
  minimal  net  book value as of June 30, 2003) to  a  lender  in  the
  third  quarter  of  2003.   In return,  the  lender  has  agreed  to
  restructure  approximately $130 million in debt related  to  certain
  of  these  aircraft.  In addition, American will provide  shares  of
  AMR  common stock to the lender as discussed in Note 2. However, the
  restructured debt agreement contains certain provisions  that  would
  require  American to repay certain amounts of the original  debt  if
  certain events occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:  (i)  an
  event  of default (which generally occurs only if a payment  default
  occurs),  (ii)  an  event  of  loss  with  respect  to  the  related
  aircraft,  (iii)  rejection by the Company of the  lease  under  the
  provisions  of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code  or  (iv)  the
  Company's  filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of  the  Bankruptcy
  Code.  The  Company  expects to recognize a significant  gain  as  a
  result  of  this  restructuring,  with  the  majority  of  the  gain
  recognized  in  the  third  quarter  of  2003,  and  the   remainder
  recognized  on December 31, 2005, if none of the above  events  have
  occurred.

  American  has  a  fully  drawn  $834 million  credit  facility  that
  expires  December 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain
  lenders  in  such facility entered into a waiver and amendment  that
  (i)  waived,  until  May  15,  2003, the requirement  that  American
  pledge  additional  collateral  to  the  extent  the  value  of  the
  existing  collateral  was  insufficient  under  the  terms  of   the
  facility, (ii) waived American's liquidity covenant for the  quarter
  ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)  modified  the  financial  covenants
  applicable  to subsequent periods, and (iv) increased the applicable
  margin  for advances under the facility.  On May 15, 2003,  American
  pledged  an  additional  30  (non-Section  1110  eligible)  aircraft
  having  an  aggregate  net  book value  as  of  April  30,  2003  of
  approximately  $450  million.  Pursuant to  the  modified  financial
  covenants,  American is required to maintain at least  $1.0  billion
  of   liquidity,  consisting  of  unencumbered  cash  and  short-term
  investments,  for  the second quarter 2003 and  beyond.   While  the
  Company  was  in compliance with the covenant at June 30,  2003,  if
  the  Company is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed  in
  Note  2  or  elsewhere in this Report, it is uncertain  whether  the
  Company  will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement  through
  the expiration of the facility at the end of 2005. Failure to do  so
  or  obtain  a waiver of this requirement would result in  a  default
  under  this  facility  and  would likely trigger  defaults  under  a
  significant number of other debt arrangements.

  In  addition,  the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges  under
  the  facility  has been decreased until the period  ending  December
  31,  2004,  and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio  will
  not  occur until March 31, 2004.  The amendment also provided for  a
  50  basis point increase in the applicable margin over LIBOR,  which
  resulted  in  an effective interest rate (as of June  30,  2003)  of
  4.73  percent.  The interest rate will be reset again  on  September
  17,  2003.   At American's option, interest on the facility  can  be
  calculated  on one of several different bases.  For most borrowings,
  American  would  anticipate  choosing a  floating  rate  based  upon
  LIBOR.

  As   of   June   30,  2003,  AMR  has  issued  guarantees   covering
  approximately  $935 million of American's tax-exempt bond  debt  and
  American  has issued guarantees covering approximately $636  million
  of  AMR's unsecured debt.  In addition, as of June 30, 2003, AMR and
  American have issued guarantees covering approximately $521  million
  of  AMR Eagle's secured debt, and AMR has issued guarantees covering
  an additional $176 million of AMR Eagle's secured debt.

14.Financial  Accounting Standards Board Interpretation  No.  46,
  "Consolidation  of Variable Interest Entities" (Interpretation  46),
  requires  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest  entity  to
  include  the  assets, liabilities, and results of the activities  of
  the   variable   interest  entity  in  its  consolidated   financial
  statements,  as well as disclosure of information about  the  assets
  and   liabilities,  and  the  nature,  purpose  and  activities   of
  consolidated    variable    interest    entities.    In    addition,
  Interpretation  46  requires disclosure  of  information  about  the
  nature,  purpose and activities of unconsolidated variable  interest
  entities   in  which  the  Company  holds  a  significant   variable
  interest.    The  provisions  of  Interpretation  46  are  effective
  immediately   for  any  interests  in  variable  interest   entities
  acquired  after  January  31, 2003 and effective  beginning  in  the
  third  quarter  of 2003 for all variable interests  acquired  before
  February  1,  2003. Special facility revenue bonds have been  issued
  by  certain  municipalities  primarily  to  purchase  equipment  and
  improve   airport  facilities  that  are  leased  by  American   and
  accounted  for as operating leases.  Approximately $2.1  billion  of
  these  bonds  (with  total  future payments  of  approximately  $5.2
  billion  as  of June 30, 2003) are guaranteed by American,  AMR,  or
  both.  The  Company  is  currently evaluating the  applicability  of
  Interpretation  46  to  these  airport lease  arrangements,  certain
  aircraft  lease arrangement and other arrangements, and the possible
  impact  on  its  future  consolidated  results  of  operations   and
  consolidated balance sheet.

  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation   No.   45,
  "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for  Guarantees,
  Including   Indirect   Guarantees   of   Indebtedness   of   Others"
  (Interpretation  45),  requires disclosures in  interim  and  annual
  financial  statements  about obligations  under  certain  guarantees
  issued  by the Company. Furthermore, it requires recognition at  the
  beginning  of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value  of  the
  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee,  with   limited
  exceptions  including:  1) a parent's guarantee  of  a  subsidiary's
  debt  to a third party, and 2) a subsidiary's guarantee of the  debt
  owed to a third party by either its parent or another subsidiary  of
  that  parent.  The  disclosure requirements are effective  for  this
  filing  and  have  been  included  in  Notes  6,  7  and  8  to  the
  consolidated  financial  statements  in  the  2002  Form  10-K.  The
  initial  recognition  and initial measurement  provisions  are  only
  applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or  modified
  after  December 31, 2002.  This interpretation has had no impact  on
  the  Company's  consolidated statement of  operations  or  condensed
  consolidated balance sheets.

15.Effective  January 1, 2002, the Company adopted  Statement  of
  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  142,  "Goodwill  and   Other
  Intangible  Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires  the  Company  to
  test  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible  assets  (for  AMR,
  route  acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize  them.
  In  2002,  the  Company completed an impairment analysis  for  route
  acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142. The analysis did  not
  result  in an impairment charge.  In addition, the Company completed
  an  impairment analysis related to its $1.4 billion of goodwill  and
  determined  the Company's entire goodwill balance was impaired.   In
  arriving  at  this  conclusion, the Company's  net  book  value  was
  determined  to be in excess of the Company's fair value  at  January
  1,  2002,  using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the  fair
  value  determination. The Company determined its fair  value  as  of
  January   1,   2002  using  various  valuation  methods,  ultimately
  utilizing  market  capitalization as the primary indicator  of  fair
  value.   As  a  result,  the Company recorded a  one-time,  non-cash
  charge,  effective  January  1, 2002, of  $988  million  ($6.37  per
  share,  net  of a tax benefit of $363 million) to write-off  all  of
  AMR's  goodwill.   This charge is nonoperational in  nature  and  is
  reflected  as  a  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change  in  the
  consolidated statements of operations.

16.The  Company includes changes in minimum pension  liabilities,
  changes   in   the  fair  value  of  certain  derivative   financial
  instruments  that qualify for hedge accounting and unrealized  gains
  and  losses on available-for-sale securities in comprehensive  loss.
  For  the  three  months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002,  comprehensive
  loss  was  $(417)  million  and $(496)  million,  respectively.   In
  addition,  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2003  and  2002,
  comprehensive  loss  was  $(1,480)  million  and  $(1,984)  million,
  respectively.   The  difference between net loss  and  comprehensive
  loss  is  due  primarily to the adjustment to the Company's  minimum
  pension  liability, as discussed in Note 6, and the  accounting  for
  the  Company's derivative financial instruments under  Statement  of
  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for  Derivative
  Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended (SFAS 133).

  American  enters  into jet fuel, heating oil  and  crude  swap  and
  option  contracts to protect against increases in jet fuel  prices.
  Beginning  in March 2003, the Company revised its hedging  strategy
  and,  in  June 2003, terminated substantially all of its  contracts
  with  maturities beyond March 2004.  During the second  quarter  of
  2003, the termination of these contracts resulted in the collection
  of  approximately $41 million in settlement of the contracts.   The
  gain on these contracts will continue to be deferred in Accumulated
  other comprehensive loss until the time the original underlying jet
  fuel hedged is used.

  At  June 30, 2003, American had fuel hedging agreements with broker-
  dealers  on  approximately  725 million gallons  of  fuel  products,
  which  represented  approximately 29 percent of  its  expected  fuel
  needs  for  the remainder of 2003, approximately 21 percent  of  its
  expected   first  quarter  2004  fuel  needs  and  an  insignificant
  percentage  of its expected fuel needs beyond the first  quarter  of
  2004.   The  fair value of the Company's fuel hedging agreements  at
  June 30, 2003, representing the amount the Company would receive  to

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2003 and 2002

Summary  AMR  Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss  during  the
second quarter of 2003 was $75 million, or $.47 per share, as compared
to  a net loss of $495 million, or $3.19 per share for the same period
in  2002.  AMR's  operating  earnings of $87  million  increased  $688
million  compared  to the same period in 2002.  The  Company's  second
quarter   2003   results  include  $358  million  in   security   cost
reimbursements  received  under  the  Emergency  Wartime  Supplemental
Appropriations  Act,  2003 (the Act) (see  Note  4  to  the  condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information).   AMR's
principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American).

The Company's second quarter 2003 revenues continued to decrease year-
over-year,  but  at a slower rate than its capacity.   In  April,  the
Company's revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the economic
slowdown, the war in Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome  (SARS).  In May and June however, these trends reversed  and
while  capacity  was  down  year-over-year, the  Company  showed  unit
revenue  (passenger  revenue  per available  seat  mile)  improvement.
Overall,  the Company's revenues decreased approximately $184 million,
or 4.1 percent, to $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2003 from the
same period last year.  American's passenger revenues decreased by 5.4
percent, or $203 million, in the second quarter of 2003 as compared to
the same period in 2002.  American's second quarter domestic passenger
revenue per available seat mile (RASM) however, increased 4.0 percent,
to  8.81 cents, on a capacity decrease of 9.6 percent, to 29.0 billion
available  seat  miles (ASMs).  International RASM decreased  to  8.57
cents,  or  1.2 percent, on a capacity decrease of 2.7  percent.   The
decrease  in  international RASM was due to a  20.3  percent  and  1.8
percent  decrease  in  Pacific and Latin American RASM,  respectively,
slightly  offset  by  a 2.4 percent increase in  European  RASM.   The
decrease  in  international capacity was driven by a 9.5 percent,  2.4
percent  and  1.8  percent reduction in Pacific,  European  and  Latin
American ASMs, respectively.

The   Company's   Regional  Affiliates  include   two   wholly   owned
subsidiaries,  American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and  Executive  Airlines,
Inc.  (collectively, AMR Eagle), and two independent  carriers,  Trans
States  Airlines,  Inc. (Trans States) and Chautauqua  Airlines,  Inc.
(Chautauqua).   In  2002,  American had a fee  per  block  hour
agreement  with Chautauqua, and prorate agreements with AMR Eagle  and
Trans  States.   In  2003,  American had  fee  per  block  hour
agreements  with  all  three  carriers. Regional  Affiliates'  traffic
increased  18.0  percent  while capacity increased  20.1  percent,  to
approximately 2.1 billion ASMs. Certain amounts from 2002  related  to
Regional  Affiliates have been reclassified to conform with  the  2003
presentation.

The  Company's  operating expenses decreased  17.1  percent,  or  $872
million.  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased 12.1 percent, or $257
million, primarily due to the Modified Labor Agreements and Management
Reductions discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.   Commissions,  booking  fees  and  credit  card   expense
decreased  16.4 percent, or $51 million, due primarily to the  benefit
from the changes in the commission structure implemented in March 2002
and  a  4.6  percent  decrease  in  passenger  revenues.  Maintenance,
materials  and  repairs decreased 34.4 percent, or  $98  million,  due
primarily  to  a  decrease  in airframe  and  engine  volumes  at  the
Company's  maintenance  bases resulting  from  a  variety  of  factors
including the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to
repair  vendors  and  a  decrease in the number  of  flights;  reduced
aircraft  utilization; and the receipt of certain vendor credits.  The
Company  expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to  increase
as  aircraft  utilization  increases and  the  benefit  from  retiring
aircraft  subsides.  Aircraft rentals decreased $37 million,  or  17.3
percent,  due  primarily  to  concessionary  agreements  with  certain
lessors  and  the  removal of leased aircraft from  service  in  prior
periods.   Food  service decreased 16.1 percent, or $29  million,  due
primarily to reductions in the level of food service.  Other operating
expenses decreased 15.4 percent, or $107 million, due to decreases  in
contract  maintenance work that American performs for other  airlines,
and   decreases  in  travel  and  incidental  costs,  advertising  and
promotion  costs,  insurance, and data processing  expenses.   Special
charges  for  the  second quarter of 2003 include (i)  a  $20  million
aircraft  related credit to finalize prior accruals, (ii) $49  million
in facility exit costs and (iii) $47 million in employee charges.  See
Note  5  to  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements   for
additional  information  regarding Special charges.   U.S.  government
grant includes a $358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement
of security service fees from the U.S. government under the Act.

Other  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $43
million  due to the following: Interest income decreased 55.6 percent,
or  $10  million,  due  primarily to decreasing short-term  investment
balances  and decreases in interest rates.  Interest expense increased
$26 million, or 15.9 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in
the Company's long-term debt.

The  Company has experienced significant cumulative losses  and  as  a
result  generated  certain net operating losses  available  to  offset
future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,
a  valuation allowance was established against the full amount of  the
Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company
provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred  tax  assets
will not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record  a
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results
in  no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge
to  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss resulting from  the  minimum
pension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note 6  to  the  condensed
consolidated financial statements.  The Company's deferred  tax  asset
valuation  allowance increased $150 million in the second  quarter  of
2003, to $903 million as of June 30, 2003.

The  effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30,  2002  was
impacted  by  a  $30  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changed  the  period  for
carrybacks  of net operating losses (NOLs).  This change  allowed  the
Company  to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather  than
two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly
recover  its NOLs.  The extended NOL carryback did however  result  in
the  displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.   These
credits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the
Company, resulting in this charge.

Douglas  DC-9s,  three operating leased McDonnell Douglas  MD-80s,  16
owned  Fokker 100s, ten owned Embraer 145s and 16 capital  leased  and
one owned Saab 340B.

In  2003,  AMR  Eagle  agreed to sell 19 ATR 42  aircraft  to  Federal
Express,  Inc., with deliveries beginning in June 2003 and  ending  in
December 2004.

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2003 and 2002

Summary  AMR Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss for  the  six
months  ended June 30, 2003 was $1.1 billion, or $7.11 per  share,  as
compared  to a net loss of $2.1 billion, or $13.27 per share  for  the
same  period in 2002. The Company's 2003 results include $358  million
in  security cost reimbursements received under the Act (see Note 4 to
the   condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for   additional
information).  The Company's 2002 results include a one-time, non-cash
charge  to  record  the cumulative effect of a change  in  accounting,
effective  January 1, 2002, of $988 million, or $6.37  per  share,  to
write-off  all  of AMR's goodwill upon the adoption  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards Board No.  142  "Goodwill  and  Other
Intangible   Assets"  (see  Note  15  to  the  condensed  consolidated
financial statements).  AMR's operating loss of $782 million decreased
$548 million compared to the same period in 2002.

The  Company's 2003 revenues continued to decrease year-over-year. The
Company's  revenues through April continued to be negatively  impacted
by  the  economic slowdown, the war in Iraq and the outbreak of  SARS.
These trends however, began to reverse in May and June.  Overall,  the
Company's  revenues  decreased  approximately  $227  million,  or  2.6
percent,  to  $8.4  billion  in 2003 from the  same  period  in  2002.
American's  passenger  revenues decreased  by  4.1  percent,  or  $293
million,  in  2003 from the same period in 2002.  American's  domestic
revenue  per available seat mile (RASM) for the six months ended  June
30,  however,  increased 0.4 percent, to 8.62  cents,  on  a  capacity
decrease of 5.9 percent, to 57.7 billion available seat miles  (ASMs).
International  RASM  decreased to 8.50 cents, or  1.9  percent,  on  a
capacity increase of 1.7 percent.  The decrease in international  RASM
was  due  to  a 22.8 percent and 0.8 percent decrease in  Pacific  and
Latin  American  RASM  slightly offset by a 1.4  percent  increase  in
European RASM.  The increase in international capacity was driven by a
16.9  percent  and 3.0 percent increase in Pacific and European  ASMs,
respectively,  slightly  offset by a 1.7 percent  reduction  in  Latin
American ASMs.

In  2002,  American  had  a fixed fee per block  hour  agreement  with
Chautauqua,  and prorate agreements with AMR Eagle and  Trans  States.
In  2003,  American had fixed fee per block hour agreements  with  all
three  carriers.  Regional Affiliates' traffic increased 16.1  percent
in  2003  while capacity increased 17.5 percent, to approximately  4.1
billion ASMs. Certain amounts from 2002 related to Regional Affiliates
have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.

                               -17-

<Page> 20
Other  revenues increased 11.4 percent, or $53 million, due  primarily
to  increases  in  ticket  change fees coupled  with  changes  to  the
Company's  change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases  in
airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increases
in AAdvantage fees.

The  Company's  operating  expenses decreased  7.7  percent,  or  $775
million.  Wages, salaries and benefits decreased 5.7 percent, or  $239
million, primarily due to the Modified Labor Agreements and Management
Reductions discussed in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.  Aircraft  fuel expense increased 16.3  percent,  or  $193
million,  due  primarily  to  a 23.8 percent  increase  in  American's
average price per gallon of fuel. Commissions, booking fees and credit
card expense decreased 18.4 percent, or $116 million, due primarily to
the  benefit  from the changes in the commission structure implemented
in  March  2002  and  a  3.5 percent decrease in  passenger  revenues.
Maintenance,  materials and repairs decreased 24.1  percent,  or  $133
million, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at
the  Company's maintenance bases resulting from a variety  of  factors
including the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to
repair  vendors  and  a  decrease in the number  of  flights;  reduced
aircraft  utilization; and the receipt of certain vendor credits.  The
Company  expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to  increase
as  aircraft  utilization  increases and  the  benefit  from  retiring
aircraft  subsides. Aircraft rentals decreased $73  million,  or  16.6
percent,  due  primarily  to  concessionary  agreements  with  certain
lessors  and  the  removal of leased aircraft from  service  in  prior
periods.   Food  service decreased 14.3 percent, or $50  million,  due
primarily to reductions in the level of food service. Special  charges
for  the  six  months ended June 30, 2003 include (i)  a  $20  million
aircraft  related credit to finalize prior accruals, (ii) $49  million
in facility exit costs and (iii) $72 million in employee charges.  See
Note  5  to  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements   for
additional  information  regarding Special charges.   U.S.  government
grant includes a $358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement
of security service fees from the U.S. government under the Act.

Other  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $83
million  due to the following: Interest income decreased 41.7 percent,
or  $15  million,  due  primarily to decreasing short-term  investment
balances and a decrease in interest rates.  Interest expense increased
$52 million, or 15.8 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in
the  Company's long-term debt. Miscellaneous-net decreased $9 million,
due  to  the  write-down of certain investments held  by  the  Company
during the first quarter of 2003.

The  Company has experienced significant cumulative losses  and  as  a
result  generated  certain net operating losses  available  to  offset
future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,
a  valuation allowance was established against the full amount of  the
Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company
provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred  tax  assets
will not be realized.  During 2003, the Company continued to record  a
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results
in  no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge
to  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss resulting from  the  minimum
pension  liability  adjustment discussed in Note 6  to  the  condensed
consolidated financial statements.  The Company's deferred  tax  asset
valuation allowance increased $533 million in 2003, to $903 million as
of June 30, 2003.

The  effective  tax rate for the six months ended June  30,  2002  was
impacted  by  a  $57  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changed  the  period  for
carrybacks of net operating losses (NOLs).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

In February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and other employees
for approximately $1.8 billion in annual savings through a combination
of  changes  in  wages, benefits and work rules.  The  requested  $1.8
billion in savings was divided by work group as follows:  $660 million
- -  pilots;  $620  million - Transportation Workers  Union  represented
employees; $340 million - flight attendants; $100 million - management
and  support  staff;  and  $80 million - agents  and  representatives.
References in this document to American's three major unions  include:
the  Allied  Pilots Association (the APA); the Transportation  Workers
Union (the TWU); and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants
(the APFA).

On  March  31, 2003, American announced that it had reached agreements
with  its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).  It also reported
various  changes  in  the  pay  plans and benefits  for  non-unionized
personnel  including  officers and other  management  (the  Management
Reductions).   The  anticipated cost savings arising  from  the  Labor
Agreements  and  the  Management Reductions met  the  targeted  annual
savings of $1.8 billion.

On April 24, 2003 and April 25, 2003, the three major unions certified
the  ratification of the Labor Agreements with some modifications (the
Modified  Labor  Agreements).   The  principal  modifications  were  a
shorter  duration  and  the ability to initiate  the  process  of  re-
negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements after three years. Even with
these  modifications, the Modified Labor Agreements continue  to  meet
the targeted annual savings.

                                -19-

<Page> 22
Of  the  approximately  $1.8  billion  in  estimated  annual  savings,
approximately $1.0 billion relate to wage and benefit reductions while
the remaining approximately $.8 billion is expected to be accomplished
through  changes  in work rules, which will result in  additional  job
reductions.   As  a  result of these additional  job  reductions,  the
Company  incurred  $60  million in severance  charges  in  the  second
quarter  of  2003 (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated  financial
statements   for  additional  information).  Wage  reductions   became
effective on April 1, 2003 for officers and May 1, 2003 for all  other
employees.  Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes  will
be  phased in over time. The Company expects total savings from wages,
benefits and work rule changes to be $400 million in the third quarter
of 2003 and $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  In connection
with  the  changes  in  wages, benefits and work  rules,  the  Company
granted  approximately 38 million shares of AMR  stock  to  American's
employees  in the form of stock options which will vest over  a  three
year  period with an exercise price of $5 per share  (see Note  12  to
the   condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for   additional
information).

In  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of  the  Modified  Labor
Agreements, the Company and American reached concessionary  agreements
with  certain  vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers  (collectively,
the  Vendors, and the agreements, the Vendor Agreements).   Generally,
under  the  terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company  or  American
will  receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect
to  certain  of  its  aircraft. In return for these  concessions,  the
Company anticipates that it will issue - over time - up to 3.0 million
shares  of  AMR's  common stock to Vendors.   As  of  June  30,  2003,
approximately 2.2 million shares have been issued to Vendors.   As  of
June  30, 2003, the annual cost savings from the Vendors are estimated
to be nearly $200 million.

The  Company's  revenue  environment has improved  during  the  second
quarter  of  2003 as reflected in improved unit revenues (revenue  per
available  seat mile) in May and June 2003. Even with this improvement
however,  the  Company's  revenues are  still  depressed  relative  to
historical  levels  and  the Company's recent  losses  have  adversely
affected its financial condition. The Company therefore needs  to  see
continued  improvement  in the revenue environment  to  return  it  to
sustained profitability at acceptable levels.

To maintain sufficient liquidity as the Company implements its plan to
return  to  sustained profitability, the Company will  need  continued
access  to  additional funding, most likely through a  combination  of
financings  and  asset sales.  In addition, the Company's  ability  to
return  to  sustained profitability will depend on a  number  of  risk
factors,  many  of  which  are largely beyond the  Company's  control.
Among  other things, the following factors have had and/or may have  a
negative impact on the Company's business and financial results:   the
uncertain  financial and business environment the Company  faces,  the
struggling economy, high fuel prices and the availability of fuel, the
residual effects of the war in Iraq, conflicts in the Middle East, the
residual  effects of the SARS outbreak, historically low fare  levels,
the   competitive  environment,  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the
Company's  international operations, changes in its business strategy,
actions   by  U.S.  or  foreign  government  agencies,  the   possible
occurrence  of additional terrorist attacks, or the inability  of  the
Company  to satisfy existing liquidity requirements or other covenants
in  certain of its credit arrangements. In particular, if the  revenue
environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the Company
is  unable  to access the capital markets or sell assets,  it  may  be
unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.

During 2001 and 2002, the Company raised approximately $8.3 billion of
funding  to finance capital commitments and to fund operating  losses.
The  Company expects that it will need continued access to the capital
markets   until  such  time  as  the  Company  returns  to   sustained
profitability.   The  Company  had  approximately  $1.8   billion   in
unrestricted cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2003.  The
Company   also  had  available  possible  future  financing   sources,
including,  but  not  limited to: (i) a limited amount  of  additional
secured  aircraft debt (after giving effect to the July 2003  enhanced
equipment  trust  certificates transaction described below,  virtually
all  of  the Company's Section 1110-eligible aircraft are encumbered),
(ii) sale-leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft
and  real  estate, (iii) securitization of future operating  receipts,
(iv) unsecured debt, (v) equity and (vi) the potential sale of certain
non-core   assets   (including   the  Company's   interests   in   AMR
Investments).  However, the availability and level of these  financing
sources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the fact that  the
Company  has fewer unencumbered assets available than it  had  in  the
past.  To the extent that the Company's revenues deteriorate and it is
unable  to  access capital markets and raise additional  capital,  the
Company  may  be  unable  to  fund its  obligations  and  sustain  its
operations.

                                 -20-

In July 2003, American issued $255 million of enhanced equipment trust
certificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at 3.86 percent
and  are repayable in semi-annual installments beginning in 2004, with
a  final  maturity in 2010.  These obligations are insured by a  third
party.

The  Company has a significant amount of indebtedness which could have
important consequences, such as (i) limiting the Company's ability  to
obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions  and  general  purposes, (ii) requiring  the  Company  to
dedicate  a  substantial portion of its cash flow from  operations  to
payments on its indebtedness, (iii) making the Company more vulnerable
to  economic  downturns, limiting its ability to withstand competitive
pressures  and  reducing  its flexibility in  responding  to  changing
business  and  economic  conditions, and (iv) limiting  the  Company's
flexibility  in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its  business
and the industry in which it operates.

AMR  and  American's credit ratings are significantly below investment
grade.  In February 2003, Moody's downgraded the senior implied rating
for AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and the
ratings  of  most of American's secured debt. Also in  February  2003,
Standard  & Poor's lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings  for
both  AMR and American, lowered the senior secured and unsecured  debt
ratings  of  AMR,  and  lowered the secured debt rating  of  American.
American's  short-term  rating  was withdrawn.   Ratings  on  most  of
American's  non-enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates   were   also
lowered.   In March 2003, Standard & Poor's further lowered its  long-
term  corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American, lowered  the
senior  secured  and unsecured debt ratings of AMR,  and  lowered  the
secured  debt  rating of American. Ratings on most of American's  non-
enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates  were  also  lowered.   These
previous  reductions have increased the Company's borrowing costs.  On
June  9,  2003,  Moody's affirmed the ratings  of  AMR  and  American,
removed  the ratings from review for possible downgrade, and gave  the
ratings  a  negative  outlook.  On June 20, 2003,  Standard  &  Poor's
raised  its  ratings of AMR and American and removed the ratings  from
CreditWatch. Additional significant reductions in AMR's or  American's
credit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other costs and
further restrict the availability of future financing. In March  2003,
Standard & Poor's removed AMR's common stock from the S&P 500 index.

American  has a fully drawn $834 million credit facility that  expires
December 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain lenders in
such  facility  entered into a waiver and amendment that  (i)  waived,
until  May  15, 2003, the requirement that American pledge  additional
collateral  to  the  extent the value of the existing  collateral  was
insufficient  under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived  American's
liquidity  covenant  for  the  quarter ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)
modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and
(iv)  increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility.
On  May 15, 2003, American pledged an additional 30 (non-Section  1110
eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of April  30,
2003   of  approximately  $450  million.   Pursuant  to  the  modified
financial  covenants, American is required to maintain at  least  $1.0
billion  of  liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short-term
investments,  for  the  second quarter 2003  and  beyond.   While  the
Company was in compliance with the covenant at June 30, 2003,  if  the
Company is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed in Note  2
to  the  condensed consolidated financial statements or  elsewhere  in
this  Report,  it  is uncertain whether the Company will  be  able  to
satisfy  this  liquidity requirement through  the  expiration  of  the
facility  at the end of 2005. Failure to do so or obtain a  waiver  of
this  requirement  would result in a default under this  facility  and
would likely trigger defaults under a significant number of other debt
arrangements.

In  addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges under the
facility has been decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004,
and  the  next  test of such cash flow coverage ratio will  not  occur
until  March  31, 2004.  The amendment also provided for  a  50  basis
point  increase in the applicable margin over London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR), which resulted in an effective interest rate (as of June
30,  2003) of 4.73 percent.  The interest rate will be reset again  on
September  17, 2003.  At American's option, interest on  the  facility
can  be  calculated  on  one  of several different  bases.   For  most
borrowings, American would anticipate choosing a floating  rate  based
upon LIBOR.

In  April 2003, the President signed the Act, which includes aviation-
related assistance provisions. The Act authorized payment of (i)  $100
million  to  compensate air carriers for the direct  costs  associated
with  the  strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii)  $2.3
billion  to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs  which
was distributed in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid  or
collected in passenger security and air carrier security fees  to  the
Transportation Security Administration as of the Act's enactment  (the
Security  Fee  Reimbursement).   In addition,  the  Act  suspends  the
collection  of  the  passenger security fee from June  1,  2003  until
October  1,  2003  and authorizes the extension of war-risk  insurance
through August 31, 2004 (and permits further extensions until December
31,  2004).  The Act also limits the total cash compensation  for  the
two  most  highly  compensated named executive officers  in  2002  for
certain  airlines, including the Company, during the period  April  1,
2003  to  April  1,  2004  to the amount of salary  received  by  such
officers, or their successors, in 2002.  A violation of this executive
compensation  provision  would  require  the  carrier  to  repay   the
government  for  the  amount of the Security  Fee  Reimbursement.  The
Company  does not anticipate any difficulties in complying  with  this
limitation  on  executive compensation and believes the likelihood  of
repaying   the   government  for  the  amount  of  the  Security   Fee
Reimbursement is remote. The Company's Security Fee Reimbursement  was
$358 million (net of payments to independent regional affiliates)  and
was  recorded as a reduction to operating expenses during  the  second
quarter  of  2003.  The Company's compensation for  the  direct  costs
associated with strengthening flight deck doors will be recorded as  a
reduction  to  capitalized  flight  equipment  as  such  amounts   are
received.

The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related  to
projected   workers'  compensation  obligations  and   various   other
obligations of $550 million as of June 30, 2003. In the first  quarter
of  2003,  the Company redeemed $339 million of tax-exempt bonds  that
were  backed  by standby letters of credit secured by restricted  cash
and short-term investments resulting in a reduction in restricted cash
and  short-term  investments. Of the $339 million of tax-exempt  bonds
that  were  redeemed,  $253 million were accounted  for  as  operating
leases.   Payments to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenue
bonds  are  generally  considered prepaid facility  rentals  and  will
reduce  future operating lease commitments. The remaining $86  million
of  tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt and
had original maturities in 2014 through 2024.

As of June 30, 2003 the Company has approximately $221 million in fuel
prepayments  and  credit card holdback deposits  classified  as  Other
current  assets and Other assets in the condensed consolidated balance
sheet.

As  discussed  in  Note  9  to the condensed  consolidated  financial
statements, the Company reached concessionary agreements with certain
lessors.   The  Vendor  Agreements with these  lessors  affected  the
payments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases.   As  a
result  of  these changes to the payment and lease terms,  30  leases
which  were  previously  accounted  for  as  operating  leases   were
converted  to  capital  leases, and one lease  which  was  previously
accounted for as a capital lease was converted to an operating lease.
The   remaining   leases   did  not  change   from   their   original
classification.  The Company recorded the new capital leases  at  the
fair  value of the respective assets being leased. These changes  did
not have a significant effect on the Company's condensed consolidated
balance sheet.

In addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide that the
Company's obligations under the related lease revert to the  original
terms  if certain events occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:
(i)  an  event  of  default under the related lease (which  generally
occurs only if a payment default occurs), (ii) an event of loss  with
respect  to  the related aircraft, (iii) rejection by the Company  of
the  lease  under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code  or (iv) the Company's filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7  of
the  Bankruptcy Code.  If any one of these events were to occur,  the
Company  would  be  responsible  for  approximately  $11  million  in
additional  lease  payments as of June 30, 2003.   This  amount  will
increase to $230 million prior to the expiration of the provision  on
December  31,  2005.  Such amounts are being  treated  as  contingent
rentals and will only be recognized if they become due.

As  part of the Vendor Agreements discussed in Note 2 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements, American entered into an  agreement
to  transfer 33 Fokker 100 aircraft (with minimal net book value as of
June  30, 2003) to a lender in the third quarter of 2003.  In  return,
the  lender  has agreed to restructure approximately $130  million  in
debt related to certain of these aircraft.  In addition, American will
provide shares of AMR common stock to the lender as discussed in  Note
2  to  the  condensed consolidated financial statements. However,  the
restructured  debt  agreement contains certain provisions  that  would
require  American  to repay certain amounts of the  original  debt  if
certain  events  occur prior to December 31, 2005, including:  (i)  an
event  of  default (which generally occurs only if a  payment  default
occurs),  (ii) an event of loss with respect to the related  aircraft,
(iii)  rejection by the Company of the lease under the  provisions  of
Chapter  11  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or (iv) the Company's  filing
for  bankruptcy  under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The  Company
expects  to  recognize  a  significant  gain  as  a  result  of   this
restructuring, with the majority of the gain recognized in  the  third
quarter of 2003, and the remainder recognized on December 31, 2005, if
none of the above events have occurred.

Net  cash  provided  by operating activities in the  six-month  period
ended June 30, 2003 was $384 million, an increase of $339 million over
the  same  period in 2002.  Included in net cash provided by operating
activities  the  first six months of 2003 was the receipt  of  a  $572
million  federal tax refund and the receipt of $358 million  from  the
government  under  the  Act.  Included in net  provided  by  operating
activities  for  the  first six months of 2002 was approximately  $658
million received by the Company as a result of the utilization of  its
2001 NOLs.  Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2003 were
$847 million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing 767-300ERs,
two  Boeing 777-200 ERs, ten Embraer 140s and four Bombardier  CRJ-700
aircraft.  These capital expenditures were financed primarily  through
secured mortgage and debt agreements.

During  the  six-month period ended June 30, 2003,  American  and  AMR
Eagle   borrowed  approximately  $641  million  under   various   debt
agreements  which  are secured by aircraft and other  property.  These
agreements  have effective interest rates which are fixed or  variable
based  on LIBOR plus a spread and mature over various periods of  time
through  2019.   As of June 30, 2003, the effective interest  rate  on
these agreements ranged up to 8.81 percent.

In  June  2003, the Company sold its interest in Worldspan, a computer
reservations  company,  for $180 million in cash  and  a  $39  million
promissory note, resulting in a gain of $17 million which is  included
in Other income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.

As  of  June  30,  2003, the Company had commitments  to  acquire  the
following  aircraft: two Boeing 767-300ERs, 12 Embraer  regional  jets
and  seven  Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003; an aggregate  of  74  Embraer
regional jets and six Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2004 through 2006; and an
aggregate  of  47 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing 777-200ERs  in  2006
through  2010.   Future  payments  for  all  aircraft,  including  the
estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate $407  million
during  the  remainder of 2003, $755 million in 2004, $711 million  in
2005  and  an aggregate of approximately $2.6 billion in 2006  through
2010.  Boeing  Capital  Corporation has  agreed  to  provide  backstop
financing  for  all Boeing aircraft deliveries in  2003.   In  return,
American  has  granted Boeing a security interest in  certain  advance
payments  previously  made and in certain rights  under  the  aircraft
purchase  agreement  between American and Boeing.   In  addition,  the
Company  has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for  all  of
its  2003 Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion  of
its post 2003 deliveries.

Special   facility   revenue  bonds  have  been  issued   by   certain
municipalities  primarily to purchase equipment  and  improve  airport
facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as  operating
leases.  Approximately $2.1 billion of these bonds (with total  future
payments  of  approximately $5.2 billion as  of  June  30,  2003)  are
guaranteed  by American, AMR, or both.  These guarantees can  only  be
invoked  in  the  event American defaults on the lease obligation  and
certain  other remedies are not available.  Approximately $740 million
of  these  special  facility revenue bonds  contain  mandatory  tender
provisions  that require American to repurchase the bonds  at  various
times  through 2008, including $198 million in November 2003. Although
American has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance
that  these  bonds will be successfully remarketed.  Any  payments  to
redeem  or  purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally  be
considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future  operating
lease commitments.

               are guaranteed by AMR and American.
        (2)    Substantially all of the 2003 commitment is supported by
               committed financing.

               the remainder of 2003 are not significant.
        (6)    Amounts are as of June 30, 2003.

In  addition  to  the  commitments summarized above,  the  Company  is
required  to make contributions to its defined benefit pension  plans.
These   contributions   are  required  under   the   minimum   funding
requirements  of the Employee Retirement Pension Plan Income  Security
Act (ERISA). The Company's 2003 minimum required pension contributions
are  approximately  $186  million and  the  Company's  estimated  2004
minimum  required  pension  contributions are  $600  million.  Due  to
uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating
future  required  contributions, such as pension plan benefit  levels,
interest  rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns,  the
Company  is  not  able  to reasonably estimate the  amount  of  future
required  contributions beyond 2004.  However, based  on  the  current
regulatory environment and market conditions, the Company expects  its
2005  minimum  required pension contributions to significantly  exceed
its 2004 minimum required pension contributions.

OTHER INFORMATION

A  provision in the scope clause of American's prior contract with the
Allied Pilots Associations (APA) limited the number of available  seat
miles  (ASMs)  and  block hours that could be flown  under  American's
marketing  code  (AA)  by American's regional  carrier  partners  when
American  pilots are on furlough (the so-called ASM cap).   To  ensure
that  American remained in compliance with the ASM cap,  American  and
American Eagle took several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of ASMs
flown  by  American's wholly-owned commuter air carriers.  As  one  of
those  measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell Executive
Airlines, its San Juan-based subsidiary.

Another  provision in the prior APA contract limited to 67  the  total
number  of regional jets with more than 44 seats that could  be  flown
under  the  AA  code by American's regional carrier partners.  As  AMR
Eagle  continued to accept previously-ordered Bombardier  and  Embraer
regional  jets  this cap would have been reached  in  early  2003.  To
ensure that American remained in compliance with the 67-aircraft  cap,
AMR  Eagle  reached  an  agreement to dispose of  14  Embraer  ERJ-145
aircraft from its fleet.  Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection
carrier,  agreed to acquire these aircraft.   Under the prior contract
between  AA and the APA, Trans States would have had to operate  these
aircraft under its AX code, rather than the AA* code, at its St. Louis
hub.

The   Labor  Agreement  with  the  APA  (one  of  the  Modified  Labor
Agreements),  ratified in April 2003, modified the provisions  in  the
APA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs  to
give  the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.
The limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reduced
and  are  now tied to 110 percent of the size of American's narrowbody
aircraft  fleet.  As a consequence of these modifications,  it  is  no
longer  necessary to use Trans States' AX marketing  code  on  flights
operated by Trans States as the AmericanConnection, and AMR Eagle  has
discontinued its plans to sell Executive Airlines.   In addition,  AMR
Eagle  has  revised  its agreement to dispose of  14  Embraer  ERJ-145
aircraft to include ten rather than 14 aircraft.

The   Company  carries  insurance  for  public  liability,   passenger
liability,  property damage and all-risk coverage for  damage  to  its
aircraft.   As  a  result of the September 11, 2001  events,  aviation
insurers  have significantly reduced the amount of insurance  coverage
available  to  commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other
than  employees  or  passengers  for claims  resulting  from  acts  of
terrorism,  war or similar events (war-risk coverage).   At  the  same
time,  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage  as
well  as  for  aviation insurance in general. The U.S. government  has
provided  commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines  until
August  12,  2003  covering  losses to  employees,  passengers,  third
parties  and  aircraft.  The Company believes this insurance  coverage
will  be extended beyond August 12, 2003 because the Act provides  for
the  insurance  to  remain in place until August  31,  2004,  and  the
Department  of  Transportation has stated its intent  to  do  so.   In
addition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy  until
December  31, 2004, at his discretion. However, there is no  guarantee
that  it  will  be  extended. In the event  the  commercial  insurance
carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available  to
the  Company or significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance,
or  if  the Government fails to renew the war-risk insurance  that  it
provides,  the  Company's  operations and/or  financial  position  and
results of operations would be materially adversely affected.

to a number of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations. The following factors, in  addition
to  other  possible  factors not listed, could  cause  the  Company's
actual  results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions

Except  as  discussed  below, there have been no material  changes  in
market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the Company's  2002  Form
10-K.

The  risk inherent in the Company's fuel related market risk sensitive
instruments  and positions is the potential loss arising from  adverse
changes in the price of fuel.  The sensitivity analysis presented does
not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall
economic  activity, nor does it consider additional actions management
may  take to mitigate the Company's exposure to such changes.   Actual
results may differ.

Aircraft Fuel   The Company's earnings are affected by changes in  the
price  and  availability of aircraft fuel.   In  order  to  provide  a
measure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships
fuel  and  maintains  fuel storage facilities to  support  its  flight
operations.  The  Company also manages the price risk  of  fuel  costs
primarily  by using jet fuel, heating oil, and crude swap  and  option
contracts.  As  of June 30, 2003, the Company had hedged approximately
29  percent  of  its  expected fuel needs for the remainder  of  2003,
approximately 21 percent of its expected first quarter 2004 fuel needs
and  an insignificant percentage of its expected fuel needs beyond the
first  quarter  of 2004, compared to approximately 32 percent  of  its
estimated  2003  fuel requirements, 15 percent of its  estimated  2004
fuel  requirements, and approximately four percent  of  its  estimated
2005 fuel requirements hedged at December 31, 2002. Beginning in March
2003,  the  Company revised its hedging strategy and,  in  June  2003,
terminated  substantially all of its contracts with maturities  beyond
March  2004.  The  Company's reduced credit  rating  has  limited  its
ability  to  enter  into  certain types of fuel  hedge  contracts.   A
further  deterioration of its credit rating or liquidity position  may
negatively  affect the Company's ability to hedge fuel in the  future.
For  additional information see Note 16 to the condensed  consolidated
financial statements.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

An  evaluation  was  performed  under the  supervision  and  with  the
participation  of  the  Company's  management,  including  the   Chief
Executive  Officer  (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer  (CFO),  of  the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's  disclosure
controls as of June 30, 2003.  Based on that evaluation, the Company's
management,  including the CEO and CFO, concluded that  the  Company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  There have been no
significant  changes in the Company's internal controls  or  in  other
factors that could significantly affect internal controls.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American
and  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment;
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The certified class includes all travel agencies
who  have been or will be required to pay money to American for  debit
memos  for  fare rules violations from July 26, 1995 to  the  present.
The  plaintiffs  seek  to enjoin American from enforcing  the  pricing
rules  in  question and to recover the amounts paid for  debit  memos,
plus  treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The Company intends
to  vigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that
the  litigation is without merit, a final adverse court decision could
impose   restrictions  on  the  Company's  relationships  with  travel
agencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of
the  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,
Inc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,
Kansas  (United  States v. AMR Corporation, et  al,  No.  99-1180-JTM,
United  States District Court for the District of Kansas). The lawsuit
alleges   that   American  unlawfully  monopolized  or  attempted   to
monopolize  airline  passenger service to and from  Dallas/Fort  Worth
International Airport (DFW) by increasing service when new competitors
began  flying  to  DFW, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
The  Department of Justice seeks to enjoin American from  engaging  in
the  alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on American  to
remedy  the alleged effects of its past conduct.  On April  27,  2001,
the  U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas granted American's
motion for summary judgment.  On June 26, 2001, the U.S. Department of
Justice  appealed  the  granting  of  American's  motion  for  summary
judgment (United States v. AMR Corporation, et al, No. 01-3203, United
States  District  Court  of Appeals for the  Tenth  Circuit),  and  on
September 23, 2002, the parties presented oral arguments to  the  10th
Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the summary judgment on  July
3,  2003.  It is unknown whether the U. S. Department of Justice  will
seek  a  review of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision by  the
U.S.   Supreme   Court.  A  final  adverse  court  decision   imposing
restrictions on the Company's ability to respond to competitors  would
have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits
were  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (King
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR
Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et
al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).
Collectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying
to  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors' fares.   Two  of  the
suits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from
1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
Department of Justice (see above description).  To date no  class  has
been   certified.   The  Company  intends  to  defend  these  lawsuits
vigorously.   One  or  more  final adverse  court  decisions  imposing
restrictions  on  the Company's ability to respond to  competitors  or
awarding substantial money damages would have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On  May  17,  2002,  the named plaintiffs in Hall, et  al.  v.  United
Airlines, et al., pending in the United States District Court for  the
Eastern  District  of  North  Carolina,  filed  an  amended  complaint
alleging that between 1995 and the present, American and over 15 other
defendant  airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based
travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The  court
granted  class action certification to the plaintiff on September  17,
2002,  defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United
States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any
time   from   October  1,  1997  to  the  present,   issued   tickets,
miscellaneous change orders, or prepaid ticket advices for  travel  on
any  of  the defendant airlines.  The case is stayed as to US  Airways
and  United  Air Lines, since they filed for bankruptcy.  American  is
vigorously defending the lawsuit.  Defendant carriers filed  a  motion
for  summary judgment on December 10, 2002. Trial is set to  begin  on
February  2, 2004. A final adverse court decision awarding substantial
money  damages  or  placing restrictions on the  Company's  commission
policies or practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between  April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003 three lawsuits were  filed  by
travel  agents who have opted out of the Hall class action (above)  to
pursue  their  claims  individually against American  Airlines,  Inc.,
other  airline  defendants, and in one case  against  certain  airline
defendants  and Orbitz LLC.  (Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta  Air  Lines
et. al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of  California - San Francisco (51 individual agencies), Paula  Fausky
d/b/a  Timeless  Travel v. American Airlines, et. al,  in  the  United
States  District  Court  for the Northern  District  of  Ohio  Eastern
Division  (29 agencies) and Swope Travel et al. v. Orbitz et.  al.  in
the  United  States District Court for the Eastern District  of  Texas
Beaumont  Division (6 agencies)).  Collectively, these  lawsuits  seek
damages  and  injunctive  relief alleging  that  the  certain  airline
defendants and Orbitz LLC: (i) conspired to prevent travel agents from
acting as effective competitors in the distribution of airline tickets
to  passengers  in  violation of Section 1 of the Sherman  Act;   (ii)
conspired to monopolize the distribution of common carrier air  travel
between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2 of the
Sherman  Act; and that (iii) between 1995 and the present, the airline
defendants  conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based  travel
agents  in  violation  of Section 1 of the Sherman  Act.  American  is
vigorously  defending these lawsuits. A final adverse  court  decision
awarding  substantial  money damages or placing  restrictions  on  the
Company's distribution practices would have an adverse impact  on  the
Company.

On April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed Albany Travel Co., et al.
v.  Orbitz, LLC, et al., in the United States District Court  for  the
Central  District  of California against American, United  Air  Lines,
Delta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other
defendants:  (i)  conspired to prevent travel agents  from  acting  as
effective  competitors  in  the distribution  of  airline  tickets  to
passengers  in  violation  of  Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act;  and
(ii)  conspired to monopolize the distribution of common  carrier  air
travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2
of the Sherman Act.  The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide
class of travel agents, but no class has yet been certified.  American
is  vigorously  defending  the lawsuit.  On  November  25,  2002,  the
District Court stayed this case pending a judgment in Hall et. al.  v.
United  Airlines,  et. al. (see above description).  A  final  adverse
court   decision  awarding  substantial  money  damages   or   placing
restrictions  on the Company's distribution practices  would  have  an
adverse impact on the Company.

On  April  25, 2002, a Quebec travel agency filed a motion  seeking  a
declaratory  judgment  of  the  Superior  Court  in  Montreal,  Canada
(Voyages  Montambault  (1989)  Inc.  v.  International  Air  Transport
Association,  et al.), that American and the other airline  defendants
owe  a  "fair  and  reasonable commission" to  the  agency,  and  that
American  and the other airline defendants breached alleged  contracts
with  the  agency by adopting policies of not paying base commissions.
The  motion  was  subsequently amended to  add  40  additional  travel
agencies as petitioners.  The current defendants are the International
Air  Transport Association, the Air Transport Association  of  Canada,
Air  Canada,  American, America West Airlines, Delta Air Lines,  Grupo
TACA,   Northwest   Airlines/KLM  Airlines,   United   Airlines,   and
Continental  Airlines.  American is vigorously defending the  lawsuit.
Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit,  a
final  adverse court decision granting declaratory relief could expose
the  Company  to  claims for substantial money damages  or  force  the
Company  to  pay  agency commissions, either of which  would  have  an
adverse impact on the Company.

On May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in Always Travel, et. al. v. Air
Canada,  et.  al.,  pending  in the Federal  Court  of  Canada,  Trial
Division,  Montreal, filed a statement of claim alleging that  between
1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines, and  the
International   Air   Transport  Association   conspired   to   reduce
commissions  paid  to  Canada-based  travel  agents  in  violation  of
Section  45  of  the Competition Act of Canada.  The named  plaintiffs
seek  to  certify  a  nationwide class of travel agents.   Plaintiffs'
motion  for  certification is set for hearing on  September  2,  2003.
American  is vigorously defending the lawsuit.  A final adverse  court
decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the  Company's commission policies would have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On  August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American
Airlines,  Inc.  in the United States District Court for  the  Central
District  of  California,  Western Division  (All  World  Professional
Travel  Services,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.).   The  lawsuit
alleges  that  requiring  travel  agencies  to  pay  debit  memos  for
refunding  tickets after September 11, 2001:  (1) breaches  the  Agent
Reporting  Agreement between American and plaintiff;  (2)  constitutes
unjust  enrichment;  and  (3) violates the  Racketeer  Influenced  and
Corrupt  Organizations  Act of 1970 (RICO).  The  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
moneys  to  American for an "administrative service charge,"  "penalty
fee," or other fee for processing refunds on behalf of passengers  who
were unable to use their tickets in the days immediately following the
resumption of air carrier service after the tragedies on September 11,
2001.   The  plaintiff  seeks to enjoin American from  collecting  the
debit memos and to recover the amounts paid for the debit memos,  plus
treble  damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The Company  intends  to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that the
litigation  is  without merit, a final adverse  court  decision  could
impose   restrictions  on  the  Company's  relationships  with  travel
agencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  August 19, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed, and on  May  7,
2003  an  amended  complaint was filed in the United  States  District
Court   for   the   Southern  District  of  New  York  (Power   Travel
International,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.,  et  al.)  against
American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines,  and
Northwest  Airlines, alleging that American and the  other  defendants
breached  their  contracts with the agency and were unjustly  enriched
when these carriers at various times reduced their base commissions to
zero.   The  as  yet  uncertified class includes all  travel  agencies
accredited   by  the  Airlines  Reporting  Corporation   "whose   base
commissions on airline tickets were unilaterally reduced to  zero  by"
the  defendants.  The case is stayed as to United Air Lines, since  it
filed  for bankruptcy.  American is vigorously defending the  lawsuit.
Although the Company believes that the litigation is without merit,  a
final  adverse  court decision awarding substantial money  damages  or
forcing  the Company to pay agency commissions would have  an  adverse
impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and
remediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami
International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through
landing  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,
Inc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties
(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of
2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future
cleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,
Inc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17
defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were
also  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American's
and  AMR  Eagle's  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably
estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that
will  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and
uncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will
ultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that
supervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

I, Gerard J. Arpey, certify that:

1.   I  have  reviewed  this quarterly report on  Form  10-Q  of  AMR
     Corporation;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
     necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
     under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
     the period covered by this report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
     financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
     material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
     cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
     this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
     responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
     procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
     for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
     disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
     supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
     registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
     us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
     which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  [intentionally omitted]

     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
     controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
     about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as
     of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
     evaluation; and

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
     control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
     most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in
     the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
     reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
     control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
     disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
     over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
     performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
     design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
     are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
     record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
     other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
     internal control over financial reporting.
