AMR CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1.The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting  principles  for interim financial  information  and  the
  instructions  to  Form  10-Q  and  Article  10  of  Regulation  S-X.
  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
  required  by  generally accepted accounting principles for  complete
  financial statements.  In the opinion of management, these financial
  statements  contain all adjustments, consisting of normal  recurring
  accruals and the asset impairment charge as discussed in footnote 8,
  necessary  to  present  fairly the financial  position,  results  of
  operations  and cash flows for the periods indicated. The  Company's
  2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the September  11,
  2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the
  air  transportation industry.  In addition, on April 9, 2001,  Trans
  World  Airlines  LLC  (TWA  LLC, a wholly owned  subsidiary  of  AMR
  Corporation) purchased substantially all of the assets  and  assumed
  certain liabilities of Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).  Accordingly,
  the  operating  results of TWA LLC are included in the  accompanying
  condensed  consolidated financial statements for the three  and  six
  month periods ended June 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA
  LLC were included only for the period April 10, 2001 through June 30,
  2001.   When  utilized  in this report, all references  to  American
  Airlines, Inc. include the operations of TWA LLC since April 10, 2001
  (collectively,  American).  Results of operations  for  the  periods
  presented  herein  are  not  necessarily indicative  of  results  of
  operations for the entire year.  For further information, refer to the
  consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included  in
  the  AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K
  for the year ended December 31, 2001 ("2001 Form 10-K").

2.Accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at June
  30,  2002  and  December 31, 2001 was $9 billion and  $8.9  billion,
  respectively.   Accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital  leases at June 30, 2002 and December  31,  2001  was
  approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

3.The  following  table  provides  unaudited  pro  forma  consolidated
  results  of operations, assuming the acquisition of TWA had occurred
  as of January 1, 2001 (in millions, except per share amounts):

                                   Six Months Ended
                                     June 30, 2001

  The  unaudited  pro  forma consolidated results of  operations  have
  been prepared for comparative purposes only.  These amounts are  not
  indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had  the
  transaction  actually been consummated on the date  indicated  above
  and  are  not  indicative of the consolidated results of  operations
  which may occur in the future.

4.As  discussed  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial
  statements included in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade County
  (the  County)  is  currently investigating and  remediating  various
  environmental conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and
  funding the remediation costs through landing fees and various  cost
  recovery  methods.   American  and AMR  Eagle  have  been  named  as
  potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contamination at MIA.
  During the second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against
  17 defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover its past
  and future cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo
  Services, Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to
  the  17  defendants  named in the lawsuit, 243  other  agencies  and
  companies  were  also  named  as  PRPs  and  contributors   to   the
  contamination.   American's and AMR Eagle's portion of  the  cleanup
  costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to various factors, including
  the unknown extent of the remedial actions that may be required, the
  proportion  of the cost that will ultimately be recovered  from  the
  responsible  parties, and uncertainties regarding the  environmental
  agencies that will ultimately supervise the remedial activities  and
  the nature of that supervision.

  In  addition,  the  Company is subject to  environmental  issues  at
  various   other  airport  and  non-airport  locations.    Management
  believes,  after considering a number of factors, that the  ultimate
  disposition  of  these  environmental  issues  is  not  expected  to
  materially  affect  the Company's consolidated  financial  position,
  results   of  operations  or  cash  flows.   Amounts  recorded   for
  environmental issues are based on the Company's current  assessments
  of   the  ultimate  outcome  and,  accordingly,  could  increase  or
  decrease as these assessments change.

5.As  of June 30, 2002, the Company had commitments to acquire the
  following  aircraft: 47 Boeing 737-800s, 11 Boeing 777-200ERs,  nine
  Boeing 767-300ERs, 109 Embraer regional jets and 20 Bombardier  CRJ-
  700s.  Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through
  2008.   Payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately
  $505 million during the remainder of 2002, $1.5 billion in 2003, $1.1
  billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $2.1 billion in 2005
  through 2008.

6.During the six month period ended June 30, 2002, American and AMR
  Eagle  borrowed  approximately  $626  million  under  various   debt
  agreements which are secured by aircraft.  Effective interest rates on
  these  agreements are based on London Interbank Offered Rate plus  a
  spread and mature over various periods of time through 2018.

  In  March 2002, the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation issued
  facilities  sublease revenue bonds at the Los Angeles  International
  Airport  to  provide reimbursement to American for certain  facility
  construction  costs.   The  proceeds of approximately  $225  million
  provided  to  American have been recorded as long-term debt  on  the
  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets.   These  obligations  bear
  interest  at fixed rates, with an average rate of 7.88 percent,  and
  mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2024.

7.Effective  January  1,  2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement   of
  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for  Derivative
  Instruments  and Hedging Activities", as amended (SFAS  133).   SFAS
  133  required  the  Company  to recognize  all  derivatives  on  the
  balance  sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not  hedges  are
  adjusted  to  fair  value through income.  If the  derivative  is  a
  hedge,  depending on the nature of the hedge, changes  in  the  fair
  value  of derivatives are either offset against the change  in  fair
  value  of  the  hedged  assets,  liabilities,  or  firm  commitments
  through  earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income  until
  the  hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion
  of  a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in
  earnings.   The adoption of SFAS 133 did not result in a  cumulative
  effect  adjustment being recorded to net income for  the  change  in
  accounting.   However, the Company recorded a transition  adjustment
  of  approximately  $64  million in Accumulated  other  comprehensive
  loss in the first quarter of 2001.

  In   addition,  effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted
  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill  and
  Other  Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires the Company
  to  test  goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (for  AMR,
  route  acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize  them.
  During  the  first  quarter  of  2002,  the  Company  completed  its
  impairment  analysis for route acquisition costs in accordance  with
  SFAS  142.   The  analysis did not result in an  impairment  charge.
  During  the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed the  first
  step  of  its  impairment analysis related to its  $1.4  billion  of
  goodwill  and  determined the Company's net  book  value  to  be  in
  excess of the Company's fair market value at January 1, 2002,  using
  AMR   as  the  reporting  unit  for  purposes  of  the  fair   value
  determination.   As  a  result, the Company is  in  the  process  of
  completing  the  second step of the impairment analysis  which  will
  allocate  the  newly determined fair value of AMR  to  each  of  its
  assets  and  liabilities.   This  allocation  is  expected   to   be
  completed  during  the  third or fourth quarter  of  2002  and  will
  likely  result in the Company recording a one-time, non-cash pre-tax
  charge  of  up  to $1.4 billion to write-down AMR's goodwill.   Such
  charge  would be nonoperational in nature and would be reflected  as
  a  cumulative  effect  of an accounting change in  the  consolidated
  statements of operations.

  The  following table provides information relating to the  Company's
  amortized intangible assets as of June 30, 2002 (in millions):

                                                 Accumulated   Net Book
                                      Cost       Amortization    Value
    Amortized intangible assets:
      Airport operating rights      $  516        $    168     $   348
      Gate lease rights                209              76         133
      Total                         $  725        $    244     $   481

  Airport  operating and gate lease rights are being  amortized  on  a
  straight-line  basis over 25 years to a zero residual  value.    For
  the  three  and  six month period ended June 30, 2002,  the  Company
  recorded  amortization expense of approximately $6 million  and  $15
  million,  respectively,  related to these  intangible  assets.   The
  Company   expects   to   record  annual  amortization   expense   of
  approximately $29 million in each of the next five years related  to
  these intangible assets.

  The  pro forma effect of discontinuing amortization of goodwill  and
  route  acquisition costs under SFAS 142 - assuming the  Company  had
  adopted  this  standard as of January 1, 2001 - results in an adjusted
  net loss of approximately $494 million, or $3.21 per share, and
  approximately $530 million, or $3.45 per share, respectively, for the
  three and six month periods ended June 30, 2001.

8.In  conjunction  with the acquisition of certain  assets  from  TWA,
  coupled  with  revisions to the Company's fleet plan  to  accelerate
  the  retirement  dates  of  its Fokker 100,  Saab  340  and  ATR  42
  aircraft,  during the second quarter of 2001 the Company  determined
  these   aircraft   were  impaired  under  Statement   of   Financial
  Accounting  Standards  No. 121, "Accounting for  the  Impairment  of
  Long-Lived  Assets  and for Long-Lived Assets  to  be  Disposed  of"
  (SFAS  121).   As a result, during the second quarter of  2001,  the
  Company  recorded  an asset impairment charge of approximately  $685
  million  relating  to  the write-down of the carrying  value  of  71
  Fokker  100  aircraft, 74 Saab 340 aircraft and 20 ATR  42  aircraft
  and related rotables to their estimated fair market values which  is
  included   in  Special  charges  on  the  accompanying  consolidated
  statements  of  operations.  Management estimated  the  undiscounted
  future  cash  flows utilizing models used by the Company  in  making
  fleet  and  scheduling decisions.  In determining  the  fair  market
  value  of these aircraft, the Company considered outside third party
  appraisals  and  recent  transactions  involving  sales  of  similar
  aircraft.   As a result of the writedown of these aircraft  to  fair
  market  value,  as well as the acceleration of the retirement  dates
  and  changes  in salvage values, depreciation and amortization  will
  decrease by approximately $18 million on an annualized basis.

9.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
  sale securities, changes in minimum pension liabilities and changes in
  the  fair  value  of certain derivative financial  instruments  that
  qualify  for hedge accounting in comprehensive loss.  For the  three
  months  ended  June 30, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive loss  was  $496
  million  and $511 million, respectively.  In addition, for  the  six
  months  ended  June 30, 2002 and 2001, comprehensive loss  was  $996
  million and $480 million, respectively.  The difference between  net
  loss and comprehensive loss is due primarily to the accounting for the
  Company's  derivative  financial  instruments  under  SFAS  133.  In
  addition,  the  six  month period ended June 30, 2001  includes  the
  cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 133.

  During   the  second  quarter  of  2002,  the  Company  discontinued
  entering  into new foreign exchange currency put option  agreements.
  The  fair  value  of  the Company's remaining foreign  currency  put
  option  agreements was not material as of June 30, 2002, and all  of
  these agreements will expire by September 30, 2002.

  respectively,  were not added to the denominator  because  inclusion
  of  such  shares would be antidilutive as compared to  approximately
  14 million shares for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001.

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2002 and 2001

Summary  AMR  Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss  during  the
second  quarter  of  2002 was $495 million, or  $3.19  per  share,  as
compared  to  a net loss of $507 million, or $3.29 per share  for  the
same  period in 2001.  AMR's operating loss of $601 million  decreased
by  $159  million compared to the same period in 2001.  The  Company's
2002  results  continue to be adversely impacted by the September  11,
2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the
air  transportation industry.  On April 9, 2001, Trans World  Airlines
LLC   (TWA   LLC,   a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  AMR)   purchased
substantially  all  of the assets and assumed certain  liabilities  of
Trans  World Airlines, Inc. (TWA).  Accordingly, the operating results
of  TWA  LLC  are included in the accompanying condensed  consolidated
financial  statements for the three month period ended June  30,  2002
whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC were included only for the period
April  10,  2001  through June 30, 2001.  All references  to  American
Airlines, Inc. include the operations of TWA LLC since April 10,  2001
(collectively, American).  AMR's second quarter 2001 results  include:
(i)  a  $685  million  charge ($430 million after-tax,  or  $2.79  per
share)  related to the writedown of the carrying value of its  Fokker
100,  Saab  340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables in accordance
with SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for  Long-Lived  Assets  to be Disposed Of" (see  footnote  8  to  the
condensed  consolidated financial statements), and (ii) a $45  million
gain  ($29 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share) from the settlement
of a legal matter related to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.

Although  traffic  has continued to increase on significantly  reduced
capacity since the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's  second
quarter  2002  revenues  were down significantly quarter-over-quarter.
In  addition  to the residual effects of September 11,  the  Company's
revenues  continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown,
seen  largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution
of  the  Company's network and reduced fares.  In total, the Company's
revenues  decreased  $1,104 million, or 19.8 percent,  in  the  second
quarter  of 2002 as compared to the same period last year.  American's
passenger revenues decreased by 19.3 percent, or $898 million  in  the
second  quarter  of  2002 from the same period  in  2001.   American's
domestic  revenue  per  available  seat  mile  (RASM)  decreased  11.9
percent,  to  8.47  cents, on a capacity decrease of  8  percent, to 32
billion available seat miles (ASMs).  International RASM decreased  to
8.67 cents, or 5 percent, on a capacity decrease of 16.2 percent.  The
decrease  in  international RASM was due to an  8.6  percent  and  3.1
percent  decrease  in Latin American and European RASM,  respectively,
slightly  offset  by  a  3.2 percent increase in  Pacific  RASM.   The
decrease in international capacity was driven by a 33.9 percent,  16.2
percent  and  12.3  percent reduction in Pacific, European  and  Latin
American ASMs, respectively.

AMR Eagle's passenger revenues decreased 15.9 percent, or $65 million.
AMR  Eagle's traffic increased 2.8 percent while capacity decreased  5
percent,  to  approximately 1.6 billion ASMs.  As with  American,  the
decrease  in  AMR Eagle's revenues was due primarily to the  continued
impact  of  the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the  economic
slowdown.

Cargo  revenues decreased $48 million, or 25.3 percent, primarily  due
to the same reasons as noted above.

Other  revenues decreased 27.4 percent, or $93 million, due  primarily
to  decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs  for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel
service charges.

                                 8
<Page> 11
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The  Company's  operating expenses decreased 19.9 percent,  or  $1,263
million.   American's  cost per ASM increased  0.5  percent  to  10.78
cents,  excluding  the  impact  of  the  second  quarter  2001   asset
impairment charge.  Wages, salaries and benefits remained flat quarter-
over-quarter, reflecting (i) a decrease in the average number of equivalent
employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and (ii) increases in the
Company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly
rising medical care and prescription drug costs. Aircraft fuel expense
decreased 22.1 percent, or $186 million, due primarily to an 11.6 percent
decrease in the Company's fuel consumption and a 9.4 percent decrease in
the Company's average price per gallon of fuel. Food service  decreased
17.4  percent, or $38 million, due primarily to the Company's  reduced
operating  schedule and change in level of food service.   Commissions
to agents decreased 40.4 percent, or $105 million, due primarily to  a
19.1  percent  decrease  in passenger revenues and commission  structure
changes implemented in March 2002. Special charges of $685 million related
to  the  writedown of the carrying value of the Company's Fokker  100,
Saab  340  and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables during the  second
quarter  of  2001  (see  footnote  8  to  the  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements).   Other  operating  expenses  decreased   19.3
percent,  or  $196  million, due primarily  to  decreases  in
contract  maintenance work that American performs for other  airlines,
and  decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking
fees,  advertising and promotion costs, and data processing  expenses,
which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs.

Other  income  (expense) increased $86 million due to  the  following:
Interest income decreased 25 percent, or $6 million, due primarily  to
decreases in interest rates.  Interest expense increased $32  million,
or  24.2  percent,  resulting  primarily  from  the  increase  in  the
Company's long-term debt.  Interest capitalized decreased $16 million,
or  42.1 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for
flight  equipment.  Miscellaneous-net decreased 86.5 percent,  or  $32
million,  due  primarily  to a $45 million gain  recorded  during  the
second  quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter  related
to the Company's 1999 labor disruption.

The  effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30,  2002  was
impacted  by  a  $30  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changes  the  period  for
carrybacks  of  net operating losses (NOLs).  This change  allows  the
Company  to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather  than
two years under the existing law, allowing the Company to more quickly
recover  its NOLs.  The extended NOL carryback did however, result  in
the  displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.   These
credits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the
Company, resulting in this charge.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2002 and 2001

Summary  AMR's net loss for the six months ended June  30,  2002  was
$1,070 million, or $6.90 per share, as compared to a net loss of $550
million,  or  $3.58 per share, for the same period  in  2001.   AMR's
operating  loss  for the six months ended June 30,  2002  was  $1,330
million,  compared to an operating loss of $764 million for the  same
period  in 2001.  The Company's 2002 results continue to be adversely
impacted  by  the  September  11,  2001  terrorist  attacks  and  the
resulting  effect on the economy and the air transportation industry.
On  April 9, 2001, TWA LLC purchased substantially all of the  assets
and  assumed certain liabilities of TWA.  Accordingly, the  operating
results  of  TWA  LLC  are  included in  the  accompanying  condensed
consolidated financial statements for the six month period ended June
30,  2002 whereas for 2001 the results of TWA LLC were included  only
for  the period April 10, 2001 through June 30, 2001. In addition, AMR's
2001 results include: (i) a $685 million charge ($430 million  after-tax,
or  $2.79 per share) related to the writedown of the carrying  value
of its Fokker 100, Saab 340 and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables,
and  (ii)  a  $45 million gain ($29 million after-tax, or  $0.19  per
share)  from  the  settlement  of a  legal  matter  related  to  the
Company's 1999 labor disruption.

Although  traffic  has continued to increase on significantly  reduced
capacity  since  the events of September 11, 2001, the Company's  2002
revenues were down significantly year-over-year.  In addition  to  the
residual  effects of September 11, the Company's revenues continue  to
be  negatively  impacted  by the economic slowdown,  seen  largely  in
business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the Company's
network and reduced fares.  In total, the Company's revenues decreased
$1,728  million, or 16.7 percent, in 2002 versus the  same  period  in
2001.   American's  passenger revenues decreased by 15.7  percent,  or
$1,349  million  in  2002  as compared to the  same  period  in  2001.
American's domestic RASM decreased 13.4 percent, to 8.58 cents,  on  a
capacity decrease of 0.4 percent, to 61.3 billion ASMs.  International
RASM  decreased to 8.67 cents, or 7.7 percent, on a capacity  decrease
of  14 percent.  The decrease in international RASM was due to a  10.2
percent and 7.9 percent decrease in Latin American and European  RASM,
respectively,  slightly offset by a 5.6 percent  increase  in  Pacific
RASM.   The  decrease in international capacity was driven by  a  36.4
percent,  15.2 percent and 8.2 percent reduction in Pacific,  European
and Latin American ASMs, respectively.

AMR  Eagle's  passenger  revenues  decreased  14.9  percent,  or  $114
million.   AMR  Eagle's traffic increased 4.7 percent  while  capacity
decreased  3.2  percent, to approximately 3.2 billion ASMs.   As  with
American,  the decrease in AMR Eagle's revenues was due  primarily  to
the  continued impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks  and
the economic slowdown.

Cargo  revenues decreased $90 million, or 24.6 percent, primarily  due
to the same reasons as noted above.

Other  revenues decreased 27.6 percent, or $175 million, due primarily
to  decreases in contract maintenance work that American performs  for
other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel
service charges.

                                  11

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The   Company's   operating  expenses  decreased  10.5   percent,   or
approximately  $1,162 million.  American's cost per ASM  increased  by
0.5 percent to 11.03 cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter
2001  asset impairment charge.  Wages, salaries and benefits increased
8.6 percent, or $334 million, reflecting (i) a decrease in the average
number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher average
salaries, and (ii) increases in the Company's pension and health insurance
costs,  the  latter  reflecting  rapidly  rising  medical  care   and
prescription drug costs. Aircraft fuel expense  decreased 23.6 percent,
or $366 million, due primarily to a 16.1  percent  decrease in the
Company's average price per gallon of fuel and a 6.1 percent decrease
in the Company's fuel consumption. Aircraft rentals increased $66 million,
or 17.6 percent, due primarily the addition of TWA aircraft. Food service
decreased 12.9 percent, or $52 million, due primarily to the Company's
reduced operating schedule and  change in level of food service.
Commissions to agents decreased 34.7 percent, or $168 million, due primarily
to a 15.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structure
changes implemented in March 2002.  Special charges of $685 million related
to  the  writedown of the carrying value of the Company's Fokker  100,
Saab  340  and ATR-42 aircraft and related rotables during the  second
quarter of 2001.  Other operating expenses decreased 15.4 percent,  or
$296   million,  due  primarily  to  decreases  in   contract
maintenance  work  that  American performs  for  other  airlines,  and
decreases  in  travel and incidental costs, credit  card  and  booking
fees,  advertising and promotion costs, and data processing  expenses,
which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs.

Other  income  (expense) increased $167 million due to the  following:
Interest  income decreased 43.8 percent, or $28 million, due primarily
to  decreases  in  interest  rates.  Interest  expense  increased  $79
million, or 31.5 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the
Company's long-term debt.  Interest capitalized decreased $35 million,
or  44.3 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for
flight   equipment.   Miscellaneous-net  decreased  $25  million   due
primarily to a $45 million gain recorded during the second quarter  of
2001  from  the settlement of a legal matter related to the  Company's
1999  labor disruption and the write-down of certain investments  held
by the Company during the first quarter of 2001.

The  effective  tax rate for the six months ended June  30,  2002  was
impacted  by  a  $57  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changes  the  period  for
carrybacks  of NOLs. This change allows the Company  to carry back 2001
and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather than two years under the existing
law, allowing the Company to more quickly recover its NOLs. The extended
NOL carryback did however, result in the  displacement of foreign tax
credits taken in prior years. These credits are  now  expected to expire
before being utilized  by  the Company, resulting in this charge.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net  cash  provided by operating activities in the  six  month  period
ended  June 30, 2002 was $86 million, a decrease of $799 million  over
the same period in 2001, due primarily to an increase in the Company's
net loss. Included in net cash provided by operating activities during
the  first six months of 2002 was approximately $658 million  received
by  the  Company  as a result of the utilization of  its  2001  NOL's.
Capital  expenditures for the first six months  of  2002  were  $1,113
million, and included the acquisition of seven Boeing 757-200s,  three
Boeing  777-200ERs,  15  Embraer  140s  and  four  Bombardier  CRJ-700
aircraft.  These capital expenditures were financed primarily  through
secured  mortgage  and debt agreements.  Proceeds  from  the  sale  of
equipment  and property of $162 million include the proceeds  received
upon delivery of three McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft to FedEx.

As  of  June  30,  2002, the Company had commitments  to  acquire  the
following  aircraft:  47 Boeing 737-800s, 11 Boeing  777-200ERs,  nine
Boeing  767-300ERs, 109 Embraer regional jets and 20  Bombardier  CRJ-
700s.   Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through
2008.   Payments  for these aircraft are expected to be  approximately
$505  million during the remainder of 2002, $1.5 billion in 2003, $1.1
billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately $2.1 billion in 2005
through 2008.

In  June 2002, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of  AMR
and  American,  and  the  credit ratings of a number  of  other  major
airlines.   The  long-term credit ratings of  AMR  and  American  were
removed from Standand & Poor's Credit Watch with negative implications
and were given a negative outlook.  Any additional reductions in AMR's
or American's credit ratings could result in increased borrowing costs
to  the  Company and might limit the availability of future  financing
needs.

                                13
<Page> 16
In  addition to the Company's approximately $2.6 billion in  cash  and
short-term investments as of June 30, 2002, the Company has  available
a  variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to:
(i)  the  receipt  of  the  remainder of  the  U.S.  Government  grant
authorized  by  the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act (the Act), which is estimated to be in excess of $40 million, (ii)
additional  secured  aircraft  debt, (iii)  the  availability  of  the
Company's $1 billion credit facility, (iv) sale-leaseback transactions
of  owned  property,  including aircraft  and  real  estate,  (v)  the
recovery  of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision
in  the  recently  passed  economic  stimulus  package  regarding  NOL
carrybacks,  (vi) tax-exempt borrowings for airport facilities,  (vii)
securitization  of  future operating receipts,  and  (viii)  unsecured
borrowings.   No  assurance can be given that any of  these  financing
sources  will  be  available  on  terms  acceptable  to  the  Company.
However,  the  Company  believes it will meet  its  current  financing
needs.

Pursuant  to  the Act, the Government made available to air  carriers,
subject to certain conditions, up to $10 billion in federal government
guarantees  of  certain  loans.   American  did  not  seek  such  loan
guarantees.

OTHER INFORMATION

As  a  result of the September 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have
significantly  reduced  the  maximum  amount  of  insurance   coverage
available  to  commercial air carriers for liability to persons  other
than  employees  or  passengers  for claims  resulting  from  acts  of
terrorism,  war or similar events (war-risk coverage).   At  the  same
time,  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage  as
well  as  for  aviation insurance in general.  Pursuant  to  authority
granted in the Act, the Government has supplemented the commercial war-
risk  insurance  until  August 17, 2002 with a third  party  liability
policy  to  cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers
for  renewable  60-day periods.  In the event the  insurance  carriers
reduce  further  the  amount of insurance coverage  available  or  the
Government fails to renew war-risk insurance, the Company's operations
and/or  financial position, results of operations or cash flows  would
be adversely impacted.

As  discussed  in  the Company's 2001 Form 10-K, a  provision  in  the
current Allied Pilots Association (APA) contract freezes the number of
ASMs and block hours flown on American's two letter  marketing code by
American's  regional  carrier partners when  American  pilots  are  on
furlough  (the ASM cap).  As AMR Eagle continues to accept  previously
ordered regional jets, this ASM cap would be reached sometime in 2002,
necessitating actions to insure compliance with the ASM cap.  American
is  working  with its regional partners to accomplish  this.   Actions
currently  being  taken  and considered by AMR  Eagle  to  reduce  its
capacity  are discussed in the Company's 2001 Form 10-K.  In addition,
American  is removing its code from flights of the AmericanConnection
carriers,  which  are  independent  carriers  that  provide  feed   to
American's  St. Louis hub.  American believes that the combination  of
these actions will enable it to comply with this ASM cap through  2002
and for sometime beyond.

In  addition, another provision in the current APA  contract limits the
total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats flown under the
American code by American's  regional carrier partners to 67 aircraft.
Similar to the above, as AMR Eagle continues to accept previously
ordered Bombardier CRJ  aircraft, this cap would be reached in early
2003. In order to ensure American remains in compliance  with  this
provision,  AMR Eagle has reached an agreement in  principle to  dispose
of 14 Embraer 145 aircraft.  Ultimately, these airplanes  will  be
acquired by Trans States  Airlines, an AmericanConnection carrier.
Trans States Airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter
airline code and expects to deploy these aircraft at its St. Louis hub
where it feeds American. The potential transaction still requires the
consent of certain third parties, including the companies financing these
aircraft, and is subject to the negotiation of final documentation.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  142,  "Goodwill  and  Other
Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires the Company to  test
goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  (for  AMR,  route
acquisition  costs) for impairment rather than amortize them.   During
the  first  quarter  of  2002, the Company  completed  its  impairment
analysis for route acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142.  The
analysis  did not result in an impairment charge.  During  the  second
quarter  of  2002,  the  Company  completed  the  first  step  of  its
impairment  analysis  related  to its $1.4  billion  of  goodwill  and
determined  the  Company's net book value  to  be  in  excess  of  the
Company's  fair  market value at January 1, 2002,  using  AMR  as  the
reporting  unit  for purposes of the fair value determination.   As  a
result, the Company is in the process of completing the second step of
the  impairment analysis which will allocate the newly determined fair
value  of  AMR to each of its assets and liabilities.  This allocation
is expected to be completed during the third or fourth quarter of 2002
and  will  likely result in the Company recording a one-time, non-cash
pre-tax  charge  of up to $1.4 billion to write-down  AMR's  goodwill.
Such  charge would be nonoperational in nature and would be  reflected
as  a  cumulative  effect of an accounting change in the  consolidated
statements of operations.

                                  14

OUTLOOK

Capacity for American is expected to be down approximately two percent
in  the  third  quarter of 2002 compared to last year's third  quarter
levels.   AMR  Eagle's third quarter capacity will be down  about  one
percent  from last year's levels.  For the third quarter of 2002,  the
Company  expects traffic to be about flat as compared to  last  year's
third  quarter  levels.   Pressure  to  reduce  costs  will  continue,
although  the Company will continue to see higher benefit and security
costs,  increased  insurance premiums, and greater  interest  expense.
However,  the Company expects to see a slight decrease in fuel  prices
as  compared to the third quarter of 2001 and the continued decline in
commission  expense due to the commission changes implemented  earlier
in  2002.  In total, American's unit costs, excluding special charges,
for  the  third  quarter of 2002 are expected to be down approximately
3.5 percent from last year's third quarter level.  Notwithstanding the
expected  decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue  pressures
seen  in the first half of the year and expected to continue into  the
third  quarter,  the Company expects to incur a sizable  loss  in  the
third quarter and a significant loss for 2002.

In  response to these financial challenges, the Company has undertaken
a  comprehensive review of its business to better align its cost
structure  with  the current revenue environment, aimed  at  improving
productivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs.  The  Company
has  begun  to implement certain of these changes, including  a  fleet
simplification  program,  adjustments to its  operating  schedule  and
increased airport automation, and will continue to refine its business
throughout the coming months.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies) (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between  American
and  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs, (2) constitutes unjust enrichment,
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay monies to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   The  plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The  Company
intends  to  vigorously  defend  the lawsuit.   Although  the  Company
believes  that  the  litigation is without  merit,  an  adverse  court
decision could impose restrictions on the Company's relationships with
travel agencies which restrictions could have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of
the  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,
Inc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,
Kansas.  The  lawsuit alleges that American unlawfully monopolized  or
attempted  to  monopolize  airline  passenger  service  to  and   from
Dallas/Fort  Worth  International Airport (DFW) by increasing  service
when  new  competitors began flying to DFW, and by matching these  new
competitors'  fares.   The  Department  of  Justice  seeks  to  enjoin
American  from engaging in the alleged improper conduct and to  impose
restraints  on  American to remedy the alleged  effects  of  its  past
conduct.   On April 27, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Kansas granted American's motion for summary judgment.  On June 26,
2001,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  appealed  the  granting  of
American's  motion for summary judgment.  The parties  have  submitted
briefs  to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has scheduled  the
case for oral argument on September 23, 2002.  The Company intends  to
defend  the  lawsuit  vigorously.   A  final  adverse  court  decision
imposing   restrictions  on  the  Company's  ability  to  respond   to
competitors would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits
were  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (King
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR
Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et
al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).
Collectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying
to  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors' fares.   Two  of  the
suits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from
1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
Department  of  Justice.   As a result, to  date  no  class  has  been
certified.   The Company intends to defend these lawsuits  vigorously.
One or more final adverse court decisions imposing restrictions on the
Company's  ability  to respond to competitors or awarding  substantial
money damages would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  May  17,  2002,  the named plaintiffs in Hall, et  al.  v.  United
Airlines, et al., No. 7:00 CV 123-BR(1), pending in the United  States
District  Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina,  filed  an
amended complaint alleging that between 1995 and the present, American
and  the other defendant airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid
to  U.S.-based travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the  Sherman
Act.   The  named  plaintiffs seek to certify a  nationwide  class  of
travel  agents,  but  no  class has yet been certified.   American  is
vigorously defending the lawsuit.  Trial is set for April 29, 2003.  A
final  adverse  court decision awarding substantial money  damages  or
placing restrictions on the Company's commission policies or practices
would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings (Continued)

On  April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed an action in the  United
States  District Court for the Central District of California  against
American, United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging
that  American  and  the other defendants: (i)  conspired  to  prevent
travel agents from acting as effective competitors in the distribution
of  airline  tickets to passengers in violation of Section  1  of  the
Sherman  Act;  and  (ii) conspired to monopolize the  distribution  of
common  carrier  air travel between airports in the United  States  in
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  The named plaintiffs  seek
to  certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no class has  yet
been  certified.  American is vigorously defending the lawsuit,  which
is  styled Albany Travel Co., et al. v. Orbitz, LLC, et al.,  No.  02-
3459 (ER) (AJW)x.  A final adverse court decision awarding substantial
money  damages  or placing restrictions on the Company's  distribution
practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in Always Travel, et. al. v. Air
Canada, et. al., No. T757-027, pending in the Federal Court of Canada,
Trial  Division,  Montreal, filed a statement of claim  alleging  that
between  1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines,
and  the  International Air Transport Association conspired to  reduce
commissions  paid  to  Canada-based  travel  agents  in  violation  of
Section  45  of  the Competition Act of Canada.  The named  plaintiffs
seek to certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no class  has
yet been certified.  American is vigorously defending the lawsuit.   A
final  adverse  court decision awarding substantial money  damages  or
placing  restrictions on the Company's commission policies would  have
an adverse impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and
remediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami
International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through
landing  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,
Inc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties
(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of
2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future
cleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,
Inc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17
defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were
also  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American's
and  AMR  Eagle's  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably
estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that
will  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and
uncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will
ultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that
supervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

          The registered office of the corporation in the State of

Delaware is to be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New

Castle.  The corporation may have other offices within and without

the State of Delaware.


                            ARTICLE II

                     Meetings of Stockholders

          Section  l.      Annual Meetings.  An annual meeting  of

stockholders to elect directors and to take action upon such other

matters  as may properly come before the meeting shall be held  on

the third Wednesday in May of each year, or on such other day, and

at  such  time and at such place, within or without the  State  of

Delaware,  as the board of directors or the chairman of the  board

may from time to time fix.

          Any  stockholder  wishing to bring a  matter  before  an

annual  meeting  must notify the secretary of the  corporation  of

such fact not less than sixty nor more than ninety days before the

date  of  the meeting.  Such notice shall be in writing and  shall

set  forth the business proposed to be brought before the meeting,

shall   identify   the   stockholder  and   shall   disclose   the

stockholder's interest in the proposed business.



<Page> 2

          Section  2.     Special Meetings.  A special meeting  of

stockholders  shall be called by the secretary upon receipt  of  a

request in writing of the board of directors, the chairman of  the

board  or  the president.  Any such meeting shall be held  at  the

principal  business  office of the corporation  unless  the  board

shall  name another place therefor, at the time specified  by  the

body or persons calling such meeting.

          Section   3.      Nominees  For  Election  As  Director.

Nominations for election as director, other than those made by  or

at the direction of the board of directors, must be made by timely

notice  to  the  secretary, setting forth as to each  nominee  the

information required to be included in a proxy statement under the

proxy  rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   If  such

election is to occur at an annual meeting of stockholders,  notice

shall  be timely if it meets the requirements of such proxy  rules

for  proposals of security holders to be presented  at  an  annual

meeting.   If  such election is to occur at a special  meeting  of

stockholders,  notice shall be timely if received  not  less  than

ninety days prior to such meeting.

          Section  4.     Notice of Meetings.  Written  notice  of

each meeting of stockholders shall be given which shall state  the

place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special

meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is  called.

Unless  otherwise  provided by law, such notice shall  be  mailed,

postage  prepaid, to each stockholder entitled  to  vote  at  such

meeting,  at  his  address as it appears on  the  records  of  the

corporation, not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the

<Page> 3

be  given  of the adjourned meeting if the time and place  thereof

are  announced at the meeting at which the adjournment  is  taken,

unless  the  adjournment is for more than thirty  days  or  a  new

record date is fixed  for the adjourned meeting, in which case a

notice  of  the adjourned  meeting  shall be given to each

stockholder  of  record entitled to vote at the meeting.

          Section  5.     Chairman and Secretary at Meetings.   At

any  meeting of stockholders the chairman of the board, or in  his

absence,  the  president, or if neither such person is  available,

then  a person designated by the board of directors, shall preside

at  and act as chairman of the meeting.  The secretary, or in  his

absence a person designated by the chairman of the meeting,  shall

act as secretary of the meeting.

          Section  6.      Proxies.  Each stockholder entitled  to

vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person  or

persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be  voted

or  acted  upon after three years from its date, unless the  proxy

provides for a longer period.

          Section   7.      Quorum.   At  all  meetings   of   the

stockholders the holders of one-third of the number of  shares  of

the  stock  issued and outstanding and entitled to  vote  thereat,

present  in  person  or represented by proxy, shall  constitute  a

quorum requisite for the election of directors and the transaction

of  other business, except as otherwise provided by law or by  the

certificate of incorporation or by any resolution of the board  of

directors creating any series of Preferred Stock.


          If  holders of the requisite number of shares to  consti

tute  a  quorum  shall not be present in person or represented  by

proxy at any meeting of stockholders, the stockholders entitled to

vote  thereat,  present in person or represented by  proxy,  shall

have the power to adjourn the meeting from


                              3

<Page> 4

time  to time until a quorum shall be present or represented.   At

any  such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present  or

represented, any business may be transacted which might have  been

transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

          Section  8.     Voting.  At any meeting of stockholders,

except  as  otherwise  provided by law or by  the  certificate  of

incorporation  or  by  any resolution of the  board  of  directors

creating any series of Preferred Stock:

          (a)  Each holder of record of a share or shares of stock

on  the record date for determining stockholders entitled to  vote

at  such  meeting shall be entitled to one vote in  person  or  by

proxy for each share of stock so held.

votes cast on the question entitled to vote thereon.

          (d)   Elections of directors shall be by ballot but  the

by the chairman of the meeting or if so requested by stockholders,

present in person or represented by proxy, entitled to vote on the

question  and  holding at least l0% of the shares so  entitled  to

vote.

          Section 9.     Action By Written Consent.  Any stockholder

seeking to act by written consent of stockholders shall  notify  the

secretary in writing of such intent and shall request the board of

directors  to  fix a record date for determining the  stockholders

entitled to vote by consent.  The notice shall specify the actions

sought to be taken and, if the election of one or more individuals

                               4

<Page> 5

as director  is  sought,  shall  include  as  to  each  nominee   the

information required to be included in a proxy statement under the

proxy  rules  of  the  Securities and Exchange  Commission.   Such

record  date shall not be more than ten (10) days after  the  date

upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the

board of directors.

          The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events

within  ten (10) days after the date on which the written  request

for  fixing a record date was received by the secretary,  adopt  a

resolution  fixing the record date.  If no record  date  has  been

fixed  by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the  date

on  which  such  a  request  is  received,  the  record  date  for

determining  stockholders entitled to vote  by  consent,  when  no

prior  action by the board of directors is required by  applicable

law,  shall  be  the first date on which a signed written  consent

setting  forth  the  action  taken or proposed  to  be  taken  was

delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered  office

in  the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any

officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book  in

which  proceedings  of  meetings  of  stockholders  are  recorded.

Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall  be  by

hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

If  no  record  date has been fixed by the board of directors  and

prior  action by the board of directors is required by  applicable

law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote

by  consent shall be at the close of business on the date on which

the  board  of directors adopts the resolution taking  such  prior

action.

          Section  l0.     List of Stockholders.  At least ten days

before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders

entitled  to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical  order,

and  showing  the address of each stockholder and  the  number  of

shares registered in the

                                5

<Page> 6

name  of  each stockholder shall be prepared.  Such list shall  be

open  to  the  examination  of any stockholder,  for  any  purpose

germane  to  the  meeting, during ordinary business  hours  for  a

period  of  at least ten days prior to the meeting,  either  at  a

place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place

shall  be  specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if  not  so

specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list

shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting

during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder

who is present.

          Section ll.    Judges of Election.  Whenever a vote at a

meeting  of  stockholders shall be by ballot, or whenever  written

consent  to action is sought, the proxies and ballots or  consents

shall  be received and taken charge of, and all questions touching

on  the  qualification of voters and the validity of  proxies  and

consents  and  the  acceptance and rejection  of  votes  shall  be

decided  by  two judges of election.  In the case of a meeting  of

stockholders,  such judges of election shall be appointed  by  the

board  of  directors  before or at the meeting,  and  if  no  such

appointment shall have been made, then by the stockholders at  the

meeting.   In the case of a solicitation of consents, such  judges

of  election  shall be appointed by the board of directors  on  or

before  the record date for determining the stockholders  entitled

to  vote  by consent, and if no such appointment shall  have  been

made, then by the chairman of the board or the president.  If  for

any  reason either of the judges of election previously  appointed

shall  fail to attend or refuse or be unable to serve, a judge  of

election  in  place  of any so failing to attend  or  refusing  or

unable to serve, shall be appointed by the board of directors, the

stockholders  at  the meeting, the chairman of the  board  or  the

president.

although less than a quorum.

secretary.   Any such resignation shall take effect  at  the  time

specified  therein or, if no time be specified, upon  the  receipt

thereof  by  the  board  of directors or one  of  the  above-named

officers  and,  unless specified therein, the acceptance  of  such

resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

          Section  4.      Removal.  Any director may  be  removed

from  office at any time, with or without cause, by a  vote  of  a

majority of a quorum of the stockholders entitled to vote  at  any

regular meeting or at any special meeting called for the purpose.

                      Meetings of Directors

the  board  of directors shall be held at the principal office  of

the  corporation, or at such other place (within  or  without  the

State of Delaware), and at such time, as may from time to time  be

prescribed by the board of directors or stockholders.   A  regular

annual  meeting  of  the board of directors for  the  election  of

officers  and the transaction of other business shall be  held  on

the  same day as the annual meeting of the stockholders or on such

other  day  and at such time and place as the board  of  directors

shall determine.  No notice need be given of any regular meeting.

          Section  2.      Special Meetings.  Special meetings  of

the  board  of  directors may be held at  such  place  (within  or

specified in the call and notice of any meeting.  Any such meeting

president,  a  vice  president, the  secretary,  or  two  or  more

directors.   Notice  of a special meeting of  directors  shall  be

meeting,  a  waiver thereof in writing, signed by  the  person  or

persons  entitled to said notice whether before or after the  time

stated  therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.  Any director

present in person at a meeting of the board of directors shall  be

deemed to have waived notice of the time and place of meeting.

          Section 4.     Action Without Meeting.  Unless otherwise

restricted  by  the  certificate  of  incorporation,  any   action

required  or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board  of

one-third  of  the  total number of directors shall  constitute  a

quorum for the transaction of business.  The act of a majority  of

shall  be  the  act of the board of directors, except  as  may  be

otherwise specifically provided by law.

majority  of those present (or if only one be present,  then  that

one),  may  adjourn the meeting from time to time without  further

notice  other  than  announced at the meeting until  a  quorum  is

present.   At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present,

any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at

                            ARTICLE VII

                         Indemnification

Section  l.      Nature  of  Indemnity.   The  corporation   shall

indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to  be


                                12
<Page> 13

made  a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit

or   proceeding,   whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative   or

investigative  by  reason of the fact that he is  or  was  or  has

agreed to become a director or officer of the corporation,  or  is

or  was  serving  or  has agreed to serve at the  request  of  the

corporation  as  a  director or officer, of  another  corporation,

partnership,  joint  venture, trust or  other  enterprise,  or  by

reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such

capacity, and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is

threatened to be made a party to such an action by reason  of  the

fact  that  he  is or was or has agreed to become an  employee  or

agent  of  the corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed  to

serve at the request of the  corporation  as an employee or agent

of another  corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other

enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,

fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred

by him or on his  behalf in connection with such action, suit or

proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and

in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best

interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action

or proceeding had  no reasonable cause to believe  his  conduct  was

unlawful; except that in the case of an action or suit  by  or  in

the  right  of the corporation to procure a judgment in its  favor

(l)  such  indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including

attorneys'  fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such  person

in  the  defense or settlement of such action or suit, and (2)  no

indemnification  shall be made in respect of any claim,  issue  or

matter  as  to  which such person shall have been adjudged  to  be

liable  to the corporation unless and only to the extent that  the

Delaware  Court of Chancery or the court in which such  action  or

suit  was  brought shall determine upon application that,  despite

the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances

of  the  case,  such person is fairly and reasonably  entitled  to

indemnity  for such expenses which the Delaware Court of  Chancery

or such other court shall deem proper.

                             13
<Page> 14

          The  termination  of any action, suit or  proceeding  by

judgment,  order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea  of  nolo

contendere  or  its  equivalent, shall not, of  itself,  create  a

presumption  that the person did not act in good faith  and  in  a

manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the

best  interests  of  the corporation, and,  with  respect  to  any

criminal  action  or proceeding, had reasonable cause  to  believe

that his conduct was unlawful.


          Section 2.     Successful Defense.  To the extent that a

director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation  has  been

successful  on the merits or otherwise in defense of  any  action,

suit  or  proceeding referred to in Section l hereof or in defense

of  any   claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be  indemnified

against   expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)   actually   and

reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

          Section  3.  Determination That Indemnification Is Proper.

          (a)  Any indemnification of a director or officer of the

corporation  under Section l hereof (unless ordered  by  a  court)

shall  be made by the corporation unless a determination  is  made

that  indemnification of the director or officer is not proper  in

the  circumstances because he has not met the applicable  standard

of  conduct  set  forth in Section l hereof.   Such  determination

shall  be  made, with respect to a director or officer, (1)  by  a

majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action,

suit  or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2)  by  a

committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of  such

directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are  no

such  directors,  or if such directors so direct,  by  independent

legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.

    (b)  Any indemnification  of  an  employee or  agent  of   the

corporation  (who  is  not also a director  or  officer  of  the

                                14

<Page> 15
corporation) under Section l hereof (unless ordered by a  court)

may  be  made  by  the  corporation upon  a  determination  that

indemnification  of  the  employee or agent  is  proper  in  the

circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard

of conduct set forth in Section l hereof.  Such determination, in

the case of an employee or agent, may be made (1) in accordance with

the  procedures outlined in the second sentence of  Section  3(a),

or  (2) by an officer of the corporation, upon delegation of  such

authority by a majority of the Board of Directors.

          Section  4.      Advance Payment of Expenses.   Expenses

(including  attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer  in

defending  any  civil, criminal, administrative  or  investigative

action,  suit  or proceeding shall be paid by the  corporation  in

advance  of  the  final  disposition  of  such  action,  suit   or

proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf  of  the

director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be

determined  that  he  is  not entitled to be  indemnified  by  the

corporation   as  authorized  in  this  Article.   Such   expenses

(including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees and agents

may  be  so  paid upon such terms and conditions, if any,  as  the

corporation  deems  appropriate.   The  board  of  directors   may

authorize  the  corporation's counsel  to  represent  a  director,

officer,  employee  or agent in any action,  suit  or  proceeding,

whether or not the corporation is a party to such action, suit  or

proceeding.

           Section  5.    Procedure for Indemnification of Directors or

Officers.   Any  indemnification of a director or officer  of  the

corporation  under Sections l and 2, or advance of costs,  charges

and  expenses  of a director or officer under Section  4  of  this

Article, shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60  days,

upon  the  written  request of the director or  officer.   If  the

corporation fails to respond within 60 days, then the request  for

indemnification  shall  be deemed to be approved.   The  right  to

indemnification  or advances as granted by this Article  shall  be

enforceable  by the director or officer in any court of  competent

jurisdiction if the corporation denies such request, in  whole  or

                              15
<Page> 16

in  part.  Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection

with  successfully  establishing his right to indemnification,  in

whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified  by

the corporation.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other

than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs,

charges and expenses under Section 4 of this Article where the required

undertaking,  if  any, has been received by the corporation)  that

the  claimant  has not met the standard of conduct  set  forth  in

Section  l of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense

shall  be  on  the  corporation.   Neither  the  failure  of   the

corporation  (including  its board of  directors  or  a  committee

thereof,  its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders)  to

have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action

that   indemnification  of  the  claimant   is   proper   in   the

circumstances  because  he  has met  the  applicable  standard  of

conduct set forth in Section l of this Article, nor the fact  that

there   has  been  an  actual  determination  by  the  corporation

(including  its  board  of directors or a committee  thereof,  its

independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) that the claimant

has  not  met  such  applicable standard of conduct,  shall  be  a

defense  to  the action or create a presumption that the  claimant

has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

          Section  6.     Survival; Preservation of Other  Rights.

The  foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be  a

contract  between  the  corporation and  each  director,  officer,

employee  and agent who serves in such capacity at any time  while

these  provisions  as  well  as the  relevant  provisions  of  the

Delaware  Corporation  Law  are  in  effect  and  any  repeal   or

modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then

existing  with  respect to any state of facts then  or  previously

existing  or  any  action,  suit,  or  proceeding  previously   or

thereafter  brought or threatened based in whole or in  part  upon

any  such  state  of facts.  Such a Acontract right@  may  not  be

modified  retroactively  without the  consent  of  such  director,

officer, employee or agent.

                                  16
<Page> 17

          The  indemnification provided by this Article VII  shall

not  be  deemed  exclusive  of any other  rights  to  which  those

indemnified  may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,  vote  of

stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both  as  to

action  in  his  official capacity and as  to  action  in  another

capacity  while holding such office, and shall continue  as  to  a

person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent

and  shall  inure  to  the  benefit of the  heirs,  executors  and

administrators of such a person.

          Section   7.       Insurance.   The  corporation   shall

purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is  or

was  or  has agreed to become a director or officer of  the  corpo

ration, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation  as

a  director or officer of another corporation, partnership,  joint

venture,  trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted

against  him  and  incurred by him or on his behalf  in  any  such

capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the

corporation  would have the power to indemnify  him  against  such

liability under the provisions of this Article, provided that such

insurance  is  available on acceptable terms, which  determination

shall  be  made  by a vote of a majority of the  entire  board  of

directors.

          Section  8.    Savings Clause. If this Article or any portion

hereof  shall  be  invalidated on  any  ground  by  any  court  of

competent  jurisdiction, then the corporation  shall  nevertheless

indemnify each director or officer and may indemnify each employee

or  agent  of  the corporation as to costs, charges  and  expenses

(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid  in

settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether

civil,  criminal,  administrative or investigative,  including  an

action  by or in the right of the corporation, to the full  extent

permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not

have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by

applicable law.

                2002 EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING PLAN


Purpose

The purpose of the 2002 American Airlines Employee Profit Sharing
Plan  ("Plan") is to provide participating employees with a sense
of  commitment to, and direct financial interest in, the  success
of American Airlines, Inc.


Definitions

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the Plan will have the
meanings  set  forth  in the 1998 Long Term  Incentive  Plan,  as
amended (the "LTIP").

"AMR" is defined as AMR Corporation.

"Adjusted  Investment" is defined as the sum of American's  notes
payable, current maturities of long-term debt and capital leases,
long-term  debt,  capital  leases,  Present  Value  of  Operating
Leases,  and stockholders' equity, and any accounting adjustments
or  extraordinary or unusual items which may be added or deducted
at  the discretion of the Committee and are approved by the Board
of Directors of AMR.

"Affiliate" is defined as a subsidiary of AMR or any entity  that
is  designated by the Committee as a participating employer under
the  Plan, provided that AMR directly or indirectly owns at least
20%  of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of such
entity.

"American"  is  defined as AMR less AMR subsidiaries  other  than
American Airlines, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

"Average  Adjusted Investment" is defined as the sum of  Adjusted
Investment as of 12/31/01, 3/31/02, 6/30/02, and 9/30/02, divided
by four.

"Calculated Amortization of Operating Leases" is defined  as  the
amortization  expense  associated with the Capitalized  Value  of
Operating Leases as if such leases were accounted for as  capital
leases,  and is determined by the straight-line method  over  the
lease term.

"Capitalized Value of Operating Leases" is defined as the initial
present  value  of  the lease payments required under  American's
aircraft  operating  leases over the initial stated  lease  term,
calculated using a discount rate of Prime plus one percent.

"Committee"   is  defined  as  the  AMR  Incentive   Compensation
Committee.

<Page> 2
"Fund" is defined as the profit sharing fund, if any, accumulated
in accordance with this Plan.

accruals   for  American's  Pilot  Variable  Compensation   Plan,
Employee  Profit Sharing Plan, Incentive Compensation  Plan,  and
any  other plan that might be created, at the discretion  of  the
Committee,  less Calculated Amortization of Operating Leases  and
any  accounting  adjustments or extraordinary  or  unusual  items
which may be added or deducted at the discretion of the Committee
and approved by the Board of Directors of AMR.

"Present  Value  of Operating Leases" is defined as  the  present
value  of  the lease payments required under American's  aircraft
operating leases over the remaining lease term, calculated  using
the  discount  rate  of  Prime plus  one  percent.   Amounts  for
3/31/02,  6/30/02,  and 9/30/02 are computed by  determining  the
difference  between the Present Value of Operating Leases  as  of
12/31/02 and 12/31/01 and allocating that difference evenly  over
the four quarters of 2002.

"Prime" is defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted  by
at  least  75%  of the 30 largest U.S. banks which  is  published
daily in the Wall Street Journal.

"Qualified Earnings" is defined as base salaries paid during  the
Plan  year, overtime, holiday pay, skill premiums, longevity pay,
sick pay, vacation pay, shift differential, overrides and license
premiums  and  does  not  include payments  such  as  travel  and
incidental   expenses,  moving  expenses,  relocation   allowance
(COLA),  payouts  from any retirement plan, disability  payments,

  (flight  attendant, reservations, coordinator/planner,  airport
  agent, sky cap, support staff, management levels 04 and below).

                                 2

<Page> 3

 -     Have  an adjusted seniority date prior to July 1st  of  the
  Plan  year.  An individual's Qualified Earnings from  the  time
  worked at American will be included in the award calculation.

 -     Be  employed at American or an Affiliate at the time awards
  are  paid.  If at the time awards are paid under the  Plan,  an
  individual has retired from American or an Affiliate, has  been
  laid off, is on a leave of absence with re-instatement rights, is
  disabled  or has died, the award which the individual otherwise
  would have received under the Plan but for such retirement, lay-
  off, leave, disability or death may be paid to the individual or
  his/her estate in the event of death, at the discretion of  the
  Committee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an employee will  not  be
eligible to participate in the Plan if such employee is,  at  the
same time, eligible to participate in:

  i)the  2002  American Airlines Incentive Compensation Plan  for
     Officers and Key Employees,
  ii)    the Pilot Profit Sharing Plan (as implemented in 1997),
  iii)    any  incentive compensation, profit sharing, commission
     or  other  bonus  plan  for employees  of  any  division  of
     American, or
  iv)     any  incentive compensation, profit sharing, commission
     or other bonus plan sponsored by an Affiliate.

Awards under the Plan will be determined on a proportionate basis
for  participation  in more than one plan  during  a  Plan  year.
Employees  who  transfer from/to Affiliates  or  any  other  plan
described  above  during  a Plan year,  and  satisfy  eligibility
requirements,   will  receive  awards  from  each   plan   on   a
proportionate basis.


The Profit Sharing Fund Accumulation

Performance will be measured by ROI and the Fund will  accumulate
based  on  that performance.  The Fund is established  at  1%  of
Qualified  Earnings  when ROI is equal to 6.4%.   The  fund  will
accumulate  on  a straight-line basis at the rate  of  0.583%  of
qualified earnings for each additional point of ROI.

The profit sharing fund will not exceed an amount equal to 8%  of
Qualified Earnings at levels of ROI above 18.4%.

Award Distribution

For  eligible domestic employees (where domestic means the United
States,  Puerto  Rico  and the U.S. Virgin  Islands),  individual
awards  will  be  distributed based on  an  employee's  Qualified
Earnings   for  the  Plan  year  multiplied  by  the  appropriate
percentage of Qualified Earnings based upon the ROI achieved  for
the  Plan  year. The percent of Qualified Earnings used for  Fund
accumulation and award distribution will be the same.

A   portion   of   the  Fund  will  be  allocated  for   eligible
international employees (employees other than those in the United
States,  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands)  based  on  the
aggregate  of  all  eligible international  employees'  Qualified
Earnings  as  a  percentage  of the  aggregate  of  all  eligible
employees'  total Qualified Earnings.  This portion of  the  Fund
will  be  set  aside  for distribution at the discretion  of  the
American officer(s) responsible for such international employees,
subject only to the Committee's approval.


Administration

The Plan will be administered by the Committee which is comprised
of  officers  of American appointed by the Board of Directors  of
AMR.   The  Committee  will  have  authority  to  administer  and
interpret  the  Plan, establish administrative  rules,  determine
eligibility  and take any other action necessary for  the  proper
and  efficient operation of the Plan.  The amount, if any, of the
Fund  shall  be based on a certification of ROI by AMR's  General
Auditor.  A summary of awards under the Plan shall be provided to
the  Board  of  Directors  of AMR at the  first  regular  meeting
following determination of the awards.


Method of Payment

The  Committee shall determine the method of payment  of  awards.
Subject to the terms of the Plan, awards shall be paid as soon as
practicable after audited financial statements for the year  2002
are available.


General

Neither  this  Plan  nor  any action  taken  hereunder  shall  be
construed as giving to any employee or participant the  right  to
be retained in the employ of American or an Affiliate.

Nothing  in  the  Plan shall be deemed to give any  employee  any
right, contractually or otherwise, to participate in the Plan  or
in any benefits hereunder, other than the right to

                                  4

<Page> 5
receive  payment  of  such  award  as  may  have  been  expressly
determined by the Committee.

In  the  event of any act of God, war, natural disaster, aircraft
grounding,   revocation  of  operating  certificate,   terrorism,
strike, lockout, labor dispute, work stoppage, fire, epidemic  or
quarantine  restriction,  act of government,  critical  materials
shortage,  or  any  other  act beyond the  control  of  American,
whether  similar or dissimilar,  (each a "Force Majeure  Event"),
which Force Majeure Event affects American or its Subsidiaries or
its  Affiliates, the Committee, in its sole discretion,  may  (i)
terminate or (ii) suspend, delay, defer (for such period of  time
as  the Committee may deem necessary), or substitute any payments
due currently or in the future under the Plan, including, but not
limited  to,  any payments that have accrued to  the  benefit  of
participants but have not yet been paid.

In  consideration of the employee's privilege to  participate  in
the  Plan,  the  employee agrees (i) not to  disclose  any  trade
secrets  of,  or  other confidential/restricted  information  of,
American or its Affiliates to any unauthorized party (ii) not  to
make  any  unauthorized use of such trade secrets or confidential
or  restricted  information during his  or  her  employment  with
American   or   its  Affiliates  or  after  such  employment   is
terminated,  and  (iii) not to solicit any current  employees  of
American or any subsidiaries of AMR to join the employee  at  his
or  her new place of employment after his or her employment  with
American or its Affiliates is terminated.

The  Committee may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan  at  any
time.

performance  and  to meet or exceed specified  goals  which  will
contribute to the success of American.

Eligibility for Participation

In order to be eligible to participate in the Plan, an individual
must  be  an officer or key employee (as designated by American's
Chairman and CEO) of American.  Additionally, the individual must
have been employed by American or an Affiliate as an

                                2
<Page> 3

officer  or  key  employee for at least three consecutive  months
during  the Plan year.  The three months service requirement  may
be  waived  in cases of retirement in accordance with  American's
then applicable pension plan, prior to completing three months of
service.

During  a  Plan  year, individuals with less than  twelve  months
eligibility  in  the Plan may be eligible to participate  in  the
Plan on a pro rata basis, at the discretion of the Committee.  In
addition,   the   Committee,  at  its  discretion,   may   permit
participation  by  officers and key employees of  Affiliates  who
have  been  so  employed  by the Affiliate  for  at  least  three
consecutive months during the Plan year.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, however, an officer or key employee
will  not be eligible to participate in the Plan if such  officer
or  key employee is, at the same time, eligible to participate in
a   commission,   incentive,  profit  sharing  or   other   bonus
compensation  program  sponsored by  American  or  an  Affiliate,
unless the Committee otherwise decides.

In  order to receive an award under the Plan, an individual  must
satisfy  the aforementioned eligibility requirements and must  be
an  employee  of American or an Affiliate at the  time  an  award
under the Plan is paid.  If at the time awards are paid under the
Plan, an individual has retired from American or an Affiliate, is
on  leave  of absence with reinstatement rights, is disabled,  or
has  died,  the award which the individual otherwise  would  have
received   under  the  Plan  but  for  such  retirement,   leave,
disability,  or death may be paid to the individual,  or  his/her
estate in the event of death, at the discretion of the Committee.


The Incentive Compensation Fund

The  Fund  is comprised of three components: financial,  employee
and  customer.  The employee and customer components have various
Measures  (see below).  Each Measure has a threshold (performance
below  this  level earns no award), target and maximum percentage
of Aggregate Target Awards that may be earned, as follows:

     Component             Threshold Target    Maximum
     Financial              16.50%     66%       132%
     Employee                8.50%     17%        34%
     Customer               12.75%     17%        34%

          Total             37.75%    100%       200%

For  each  Measure, the Fund will accumulate on  a  linear  basis
between each of the points defined in the following tables.

                              3
<Page> 4

Financial Measure:

The financial measure is based on Net Income.  At a threshold Net
Income  of  $125  million,  the Fund will  accumulate  16.50%  of
Aggregate  Target  Awards.  Higher Net  Incomes  will  result  in
higher percentages of Aggregate Target Awards as follows:



               Net Income         % of Target Awards Earned
               $  125                       16.50%
               $  310                       33.00%
               $  495                       49.50%
               $  680                       66.00%
               $  935                       99.00%
               $1,190                      132.00% (Max)


Employee Measures:

The employee measures will depend on Engagement Scores.

                                           Threshold      Target     Maximum
          Engagement Score                      5%          10%       20%
          Engagement versus National Norm     3.5%           7%       14%

            Total                             8.5%          17%       34%

At a threshold Engagement Score of 72%, the Fund will accumulate
5% of Aggregate Target Awards.  Higher scores will result in
higher percentages of Aggregate Target Awards, as follows:

          Engagement Score         % of Target Awards Earned
               72%                           5.00%
               73%                           7.50%
               74%                          10.00%
               75%                          15.00%
               76%                          20.00% (Max)

At  a  threshold Engagement Score of 7% below National Norm,  the
Fund  will  accumulate 3.5% of Aggregate Target  Awards.   Higher
scores  will  result  in higher percentages of  Aggregate  Target
Awards, as follows:

         Percent below National Norm   % of Target Awards Earned
                    7%                        3.50%
                    6%                        5.25%
                    5%                        7.00%
                    4%                       10.50%
                    3%                       14.00% (Max)

                                 4

<Page> 5
In  the event the Employee Opinion Survey is not conducted during
the  plan  year  measured, AA's Engagement Score  and  Engagement
versus the National Norm will be calculated at target.


Customer Measures:

Customer Measures will depend on DOT Rank and Survey America
Rank.  Each of the five components (retained preference, overall
travel experience, overall ground service, overall on-board
service and DOT A+14 rankings) is measured separately.  For each
Measure, at a threshold rank of fourth, the fund will accumulate
2.55% of Aggregate Target Awards.  A higher rank will result in
higher percentages of Aggregate Target Awards, as follows:

               Rank                % of Target Awards Earned
               Fourth                            2.55%
               Third                             3.40%
               Second                            5.10%
               First                             6.80% (Max)

Allocation of Individual Awards

The  Chairman and CEO of American, in consultation with the Vice-
Chairman, executive and senior vice presidents of American,  will
determine  awards for non-officer eligible employees  based  upon
the eligible employee's performance.  Unless otherwise determined
by  the  Chairman,  an  award under the  Plan  to  a  non-officer
eligible  employee, when combined with any other  award  for  the
Plan  year  whether  such  other  award  is  under  an  incentive
compensation,   commission,  profit  sharing   or   other   bonus
compensation   plan,  may  not  exceed  100%  of  such   eligible
employee's base salary.

The  Committee,  in  consultation with the Chairman  and  CEO  of
American,   will  determine  awards  for  officers  of  American,
including the Named Executive Officers.  The awards for  officers
(other  than the Named Executive Officers) will be equal  to  the
appropriate  Target  Award,  plus or minus  any  adjustments  for
individual performance.  To the extent that an award to  a  Named
Executive  Officer  includes  a partial  payment  relating  to  a
Measure  (other  than Net Income), such partial payment  will  be
paid  from the general operating funds of American.     An  award
under  the Plan to an officer may not exceed the amount set forth
in Section 11 of the LTIP.

The  aggregate of all awards paid hereunder will not  exceed  the
lesser  of:  (2.0 times the Fund at Aggregate Target  Awards)  or
(50%  of the total base salaries of all eligible participants  in
the  Plan).    In the discretion of the Committee, the  Fund  may
not be fully distributed.


Administration

The  Committee  shall have authority to administer and  interpret
the   Plan,  establish  administrative  rules,  approve  eligible
participants, and take any other action necessary for the  proper
and efficient operation of the Plan.  For participants other than
the Named Executive Officers, the Committee reserves the right to
adjust  the  calculation  of  each  Measure  at  its  discretion.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  herein,  no
awards  will be made under the Plan unless awards are  also  made
under the 2002 American Airlines Employee Profit Sharing Plan and
the  2002  Pilot  Variable Compensation Plan for members  of  the
Allied Pilots Association.  The amount, if any, of
the  Fund  shall  be audited by the General Auditor  of  American
based  on  a  certification of Net Income  by  AMR's  independent
auditors.   A summary of awards under the Plan shall be  provided
to   the   Committee  at  the  first  regular  meeting  following
determination  of  the awards.  To the extent  a  Measure  is  no

                                              Exhibit 10.10
               2002 - 2004 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
                 FOR OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES

Purpose

The  purpose of the 2002 - 2004 AMR Corporation Performance Share
Plan  ("Plan")  for  Officers and Key  Employees  is  to  provide
greater   incentive  to  officers  and  key  employees   of   the
subsidiaries  and affiliates of AMR Corporation  ("AMR"  or  "the
Corporation")   to  achieve  the  highest  level  of   individual
performance  and  to meet or exceed specified  goals  which  will
contribute  to  the  success of the Corporation.   This  Plan  is
adopted pursuant to the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended
("LTIP").

agreement for performance shares between the Corporation and  the
employee, will have the meanings set forth in the LTIP.

For purposes of the Plan, the following definitions will control:

"Affiliate" is defined as a subsidiary of AMR or any entity that

the Plan, provided that AMR directly or indirectly owns at least
20% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of such
entity.

Committee, or its successor, of the AMR Board of Directors.

months prior to the beginning and ending points of the
Measurement Period will be used to smooth out market
fluctuations.

"Daily Closing Stock Price" is defined as the stock price at the
close of trading (4:00 PM EST) of the National Exchange on which

                           STOCK OPTION


      STOCK  OPTION granted Date, by AMR Corporation,  a  Delaware
corporation  (the "Corporation"), and First Last, employee  number
999999,  an employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (the "Optionee").

                       W I T N E S S E T H:

      WHEREAS,  the stockholders of the Corporation  approved  the
1998  Long Term Incentive Plan at the Corporation's annual meeting
held  on  May 20, 1998 (such plan, as may be amended from time  to
time, to be referenced the "1998 Plan");

     WHEREAS, the 1998 Plan provides for the grant of an option to
purchase  shares  of  the  Corporation's  Common  Stock  to  those
individuals  selected by the Committee or, in  lieu  thereof,  the
Board of Directors of AMR Corporation (the "Board"); and

      WHEREAS,  the  Board  has determined that  the  Optionee  is
eligible  under  the  Plan and that it is  to  the  advantage  and
interest  of  the  Corporation to grant the  option  provided  for
herein  to the Optionee as an incentive for Optionee to remain  in
the  employ  of  the  Corporation or one of  its  Subsidiaries  or
Affiliates,  and  to encourage ownership by the  Optionee  of  the
Corporation's Common Stock, $1 par value (the "Common Stock").

     NOW, THEREFORE:

      1.   Option  Grant.  The Corporation hereby  grants  to  the
Optionee  a non-qualified stock option, subject to the  terms  and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to purchase all or any  part  of
an aggregate of xxxx shares of Common Stock at a price of
$xx.xxxx  per  share (being the fair market value  of  the  Common
Stock  on  the  date  hereof), exercisable in approximately  equal
installments on and after the following dates and with respect  to
the following number of shares of Common Stock:

 Exercisable On and After           Number of Shares
        07/23/2002                         XXX
        07/23/2003                         XXX
        07/23/2004                         XXX
        07/23/2005                         XXX
        07/23/2006                         XXX

                                   1
<Page> 2
provided,  that  in no event shall this option be  exercisable  in
whole  or  in  part ten years from the date hereof  and  that  the
Corporation  shall  in no event be obligated to  issue  fractional
shares.   The  right to exercise this option and to  purchase  the
number  of  shares  comprising  each  such  installment  shall  be
cumulative, and once such right has become exercisable it  may  be
exercised in whole at any time and in part from time to time until
the date of termination of the Optionee's rights hereunder.

      2.    Restriction  on Exercise.  Notwithstanding  any  other
provision  hereof, this option shall not be exercised if  at  such
time  such  exercise or the delivery of certificates  representing
shares  of Common Stock purchased pursuant hereto shall constitute
a  violation of any rule of the Corporation, any provision of  any
applicable  Federal or State statute, rule or regulation,  or  any
rule  or regulation of any securities exchange on which the Common
Stock may be listed.

      3.    Manner of Exercise.  This option may be exercised with
respect  to  all  or any part of the shares of Common  Stock  then
subject  to such exercise pursuant to whatever procedures  may  be
adopted by the Corporation.  In the event that at the time of such
exercise  the  shares of Common Stock as to which this  option  is
exercisable have not been registered under the Securities  Act  of
1933, the Optionee will make a representation that he is acquiring
the shares of Common Stock for investment only and not with a view
to  distribution. Subject to compliance by the Optionee  with  all
the  terms  and conditions hereof, the Corporation  or  its  agent
shall promptly thereafter deliver to the Optionee a certificate or
certificates  for such shares with all requisite  transfer  stamps
attached.   (In the event of a cashless exercise, the  Corporation
or its agent will pay to the Optionee the appropriate cash amount,
less required withholdings.)

      4.   Termination of Option.  This option shall terminate and
may  no  longer be exercised if (i) the Optionee ceases to  be  an
employee  of  the  Corporation  or  one  of  its  Subsidiaries  or
Affiliates;  or  (ii)  the  Optionee  becomes  an  employee  of  a
Subsidiary  that is not wholly owned, directly or  indirectly,  by
the  Corporation; or (iii) the Optionee takes a leave  of  absence
without  reinstatement rights, unless otherwise agreed in  writing
between the Corporation and the Optionee; except that

     (a)   If  the Optionee's employment by the Corporation  (and
any  Subsidiary or Affiliate) terminates by reason of death,  the
vesting  of  the option will be accelerated and the  option  will
remain exerciseable until its expiration;


                                  2
<Page> 3
     (b)   If  the Optionee's employment by the Corporation  (and
any  Subsidiary or Affiliate) terminates by reason of Disability,
the option will continue to vest in accordance with its terms and
may be exercised until its expiration; provided, however, that if
the Optionee dies after such Disability the vesting of the option
will be accelerated and the option will remain exerciseable until
its expiration;

     (c)   Subject to Section 7(c), if the Optionee's  employment
by  the  Corporation (and any Subsidiary or Affiliate) terminates
by reason of Normal or Early Retirement, the option will continue
to  vest in accordance with its terms and may be exercised  until
its  expiration;  provided, however, that if  the  Optionee  dies
after  Retirement the vesting of the option will  be  accelerated
and the option will remain exerciseable until its expiration;

     (d)   If  the Optionee's employment by the Corporation  (and
any  Subsidiary or Affiliate) is involuntarily terminated by  the
Corporation  or a Subsidiary or Affiliate (as the  case  may  be)
without  Cause,  the option may thereafter be exercised,  to  the
extent  it  was  exercisable at the time of  termination,  for  a
period  of  three  months from the date of  such  termination  of
employment  or  until the stated term of such  option,  whichever
period is shorter; and

      (e)   In  the  event of a Change in Control or  a  Potential
Change  in  Control of the Corporation, this option  shall  become
exercisable in accordance with the 1998 Plan, or its successor.

      5.   Adjustments in Common Stock.  In the event of any stock
dividend,  stock  split,  merger,  consolidation,  reorganization,
recapitalization  or  other  change in  the  corporate  structure,
appropriate adjustments may be made by the Board in the number  of
shares, class or classes of securities and the price per share.

      6.    Non-Transferability of Option.  Unless  the  Committee
shall permit (on such terms and conditions as it shall establish),
an  option  may not be transferred except by will or the  laws  of
descent and distribution to the extent provided herein. During the
lifetime of the Optionee this option may be exercised only by  him
or her (unless otherwise determined by the Committee).

     7.   Miscellaneous.

     (a)   This option (i) shall be binding upon and inure to  the
benefit  of  any  successor  of the  Corporation,  (ii)  shall  be
governed  by  the laws of the State of Texas, and  any  applicable
laws of the United States, and (iii) may not be amended except  in
writing.   No contract or right of employment shall be implied  by
this option.

                                3

     (b)  If this option is assumed or a new option is substituted
therefore  in  any  corporate reorganization (including,  but  not
limited  to,  any transaction of the type referred to  in  Section
425(a)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended),
employment by such assuming or substituting corporation  or  by  a
parent corporation or a subsidiary thereof shall be considered for
all purposes of this option to be employment by the Corporation.

      (c)  In the event the Optionee's employment is terminated by
reason of Early or Normal Retirement and the Optionee subsequently
is  employed  by a competitor of the Corporation, the  Corporation
reserves  the right, upon notice to the Optionee, to  declare  the
option forfeited and of no further validity.

      8.   Securities Law Requirements.  The Corporation shall not
be  required  to  issue shares upon the exercise  of  this  option
unless  and until (a) such shares have been duly listed upon  each
stock   exchange  on  which  the  Corporation's  Stock   is   then
registered; and (b) a registration statement under the  Securities
Act of 1933 with respect to such shares is then effective.

      The  Board  may  require  the Optionee  to  furnish  to  the
Corporation,  prior  to the issuance of any  shares  of  Stock  in
connection with the exercise of this option, an agreement, in such
form as the Board may from time to time deem appropriate, in which
the  Optionee represents that the shares acquired by him upon such
exercise are being acquired for investment and not with a view  to
the sale or distribution thereof.

     9.   Option Subject to 1998 Plan.  This option shall be
subject to all the terms and provisions of the 1998 Plan and the
Optionee shall abide by and be bound by all rules, regulations and
determinations of the Board now or hereafter made in connection
with the administration of the 1998 Plan.  Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for
such terms in the 1998 Plan.

      IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has executed this Stock
Option as of the day and year first above written.
