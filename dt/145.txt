                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (unaudited)

1.  The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three month and six
month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 were not audited.  However, in
Management's opinion, the information reflects all adjustments necessary for a
fair statement of the results for the periods presented.  Management believes
all adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature.

2.  These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the
1999 audited financial statements in Bethlehem's Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Presentation of certain
amounts in the prior year have been revised to be consistent with the current
year.

3.  On May 29, 1998, Bethlehem acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Lukens Inc.  Transaction related costs of $6.6 million were paid during the
first half of 1999.  The stainless and distribution businesses acquired in the
Lukens purchase were accounted for as discontinued operations.  Income or
losses from these businesses were not included in Bethlehem's operating
results.  In the first quarter of 2000, Bethlehem completed the divestiture of
these businesses.  The net assets of these operations are shown separately on
the balance sheet and consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and
working capital.

4.  During the second quarter of 2000, Bethlehem recognized unusual gains of
$26.9 million ($22.2 million after-tax or $.17 per diluted share). Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company converted from a mutual company owned by its
policyowners to a stock company.  As a policyholder, Bethlehem received $17.9
million in cash in relation to this conversion.  We sold our equity interest in
Presque Isle Corporation for $10.0 million and recognized a gain of $9.0
million. Presque Isle operates a limestone quarry in Michigan.  Bethlehem will
continue to purchase limestone from Presque Isle at market prices.

           ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Review of Results:

Second Quarter and First Six Months 2000
Second Quarter and First Six Months 1999

         We reported net income for the second quarter of 2000 of $32 million
($.16 per diluted common share).  Included in the second quarter results were
unusual pre-tax gains of $27 million, or $22 million after-tax ($.17 per
diluted common share).  Excluding these unusual gains, our net income for the
second quarter of 2000 was $10 million, which is a loss of $.01 per diluted
common share.  This compares with a net loss of $30 million, or a loss of $.31
per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 1999.  Sales for the second
quarter of 2000 were $1.1 billion compared with $1.0 billion for the second
quarter of 1999.

         For the first six months of 2000, our net income was $35 million.
Excluding unusual gains, net income for the first six months was $12 million,
which is a loss of $.06 per diluted common share, compared with a loss of $55
million, or a loss $.58 per diluted common share, in the first six months of
1999.  Sales for the first half of 2000 were $2.2 billion compared with $1.9
billion for the first half of 1999.

         The $27 million of pre-tax unusual gains recorded in the second
quarter of 2000 resulted from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's conversion
from a mutual company owned by its policyholders to a publicly held company and
from the sale of our equity interest in Presque Isle Corporation.  As a
policyholder with Metropolitan Life, we received $18 million from this
conversion, all of which was recognized as a gain.  We also recognized a gain
of $9 million from the sale of our equity interest in Presque Isle Corporation,
which operates a limestone quarry in Michigan.


Operating Results

         Our income from operations was $52 million for the second quarter of
2000.  Excluding the unusual gains discussed above, income from operations was
$25 million compared with a loss from operations of $26 million for the second
quarter of 1999.  Our second quarter 2000 operating results improved from a
year ago primarily because of lower costs and slightly higher shipments and
steel prices.  Our costs were lower than last year because of continued
emphasis on cost controls, higher productivity, and the absence of costs
incurred in the second quarter of 1999 in connection with the reline of
Sparrows Point's "L" blast furnace.  Our costs were lower than a year ago
despite higher steelworker wages and benefits, rising energy costs, especially
natural gas, higher scrap costs and increases in other post retirement benefits
expense.

                                     - 6 -












<PAGE> 8

         Income from operations for the first six months of 2000, excluding
unusual gains, was $44 million, an improvement of about $90 million from a loss
of $46 million in the first six months of 1999.  This improvement was largely
due to the same reasons cited above.

         Our income from operations for the second quarter of 2000 improved
from the first quarter as lower shipments were offset by lower costs, higher
steel prices, and a slightly better product mix.  Our costs were lower despite
significantly higher natural gas costs and several planned modernization and
repair outages at key production facilities at Sparrows Point.


Liquidity and Capital Structure

         At June 30, 2000, our total liquidity, comprising cash, cash
equivalents and funds available under our bank credit arrangements, totaled
$451 million compared with $334 million at December 31, 1999.

         For the first six months of 2000, cash provided from continuing
operating activities was $229 million, an improvement of $116 million over the
first six months of 1999.  This improvement is primarily because of higher
income.  We expect to maintain an adequate level of liquidity during 2000 with
cash provided from operations, available funds under our bank credit
arrangements, reductions in working capital, primarily inventory, and asset
sales.

         Major uses of cash for 2000 are expected to be capital expenditures of
about $250 million, debt payments, and pension funding.  During the second
quarter, we repaid $60 million of borrowings under our bank credit
arrangements, thereby increasing our availability to about $320 million.


Strategic Initiatives

         We have essentially completed the extensive modernization of our
Sparrows Point Division.  This modernization involved eight very important
strategic projects, the last three of which were successfully completed this
past quarter, including a new cold mill complex, wide-slab caster, and
pulverized coal injection facility.  As a result, during the balance of this
year, we expect to start achieving the benefits of this modernization program
as these new facilities move toward reaching their full production capability.

         We also continue to develop our e-Business platform.  In addition to
our equity position in MetalSite, we recently acquired an equity interest in
OneBuild, a company dedicated to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
procurement in the commercial construction market.  Additionally, we have
partnered with Ariba, Inc.  for its e-Procurement initiatives.

Dividends

         On July 26, 2000, our Board of Directors declared dividends of $1.25
per share on our $5.00 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.625 per share
on our $2.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and $0.875 per share on our
$3.50 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, each payable September 10, 2000,
to holders of record on August 10, 2000.  No dividend was declared on our
Common Stock.


Outlook

         The U.S.  economy remains strong but evidence of some slowing is
appearing in certain of our markets.  Steel consumption in the United States
has been very strong this year, but we expect it to decline slightly in the
second half of 2000 because of higher interest rates and a moderation in
consumer spending.  Globally, steel demand continues to improve, but imports
into the U.S.  remain a concern.  Additionally, customer inventories are being
reduced and some new domestic capacity has entered the marketplace.  As a
result, competition remains intense.

         We are continuing to implement our strategy of concentrating on steel,
rebuilding our financial strength, and improving continuously in everything
that we do.  In doing so, we will take all necessary actions to accelerate our
cost reduction initiatives and advance our growth initiatives through
improvements in the use of existing assets, new business development, and
e-Business activities.

                       Amendment dated June 28, 2000 to
           1998 Stock Incentive Plan of Bethlehem Steel Corporation


         WHEREAS, on December 10, 1997, the Board of Directors of Bethlehem
Steel Corporation (Bethlehem) adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan of
Bethlehem Steel Corporation (the Plan); and

         WHEREAS, the stockholders of Bethlehem approved the Plan at its 1998
Annual Meeting; and WHEREAS, the Plan reserved for issuance an aggregate of
5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of Bethlehem, with no more than 1,000,000 of
such shares being available for issuance pursuant to Grants (as defined in the
Plan); and

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Bethlehem desires to amend the Plan
to change the number of shares of Common Stock that can be issued pursuant to
Grants from 1,000,000 to 1,350,000, but not to change the total number of
shares of Common Stock that can be issued pursuant to the Plan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Directors of Bethlehem, pursuant to
Section 23 of the Plan, hereby amends the first sentence of Section 2 of the
Plan, effective June 28, 2000, to read as follows:  "Subject to certain
adjustments as set forth in Section 15 hereof, there shall be reserved for
issuance upon the exercise or surrender of the right to exercise options to be
granted under the Plan (Options) and pursuant to stock awards (Grants) an
aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Common Stock of Bethlehem (Common Stock);
provided, however, that the number of such shares issued pursuant to Grants
shall not exceed 1,350,000." All other provisions of the Plan shall remain in
full force and effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Board of Directors of Bethlehem has authorized
the execution of this Amendment as of June 28, 2000.

                                           BETHLEHEM STEEL CORPORATION,
                                             by
