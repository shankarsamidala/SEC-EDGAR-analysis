                                   PART I
                           REGISTRANT INFORMATION

Full name of registrant: Sunbeam Corporation


Former name, if applicable: Not Applicable


Address of principal executive office: 2381 Executive Center Drive


City, state and zip code: Boca Raton, Florida  33431




                                  PART II
                          RULE 12b-25 (b) AND (c)

      If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort
or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the
following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate.)


       (a)   The reason described in detail in Part III of this form could
             not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;

|X|    (b)   The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition
             report on Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion
             thereof will be filed on or before the 15th day following the
             prescribed due date; or the subject quarterly report or
             transition report on Form 10-Q, or portion thereof will be
             filed on or before the fifth calendar day following the
             prescribed due date; and

       (c)   The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule
             12b-25 (c) has been attached, if applicable.

                                  PART III
                                 NARRATIVE

      State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 11-K,
20-F, 10-Q, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be
filed within the prescribed time period.

      Sunbeam Corporation (the "Company") completed and filed its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1999 on June 11,
1999 and filed its 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission on
May 11, 1999. The delay in filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1999 and its 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K
resulted primarily from changes in the Company's management, changes in the
Company's auditors and the Company's restatement of its financial
statements for the 1997 fiscal year and for the fourth quarter of 1996 and
the first quarter of 1998, all of which have been previously detailed in
the Company's filings with the Commission. Both the Company's management
and its auditors allocated substantial resources to these efforts. In
addition, the Company filed with the Commission on July 22, 1999 an
amendment to the Company's pending registration statement on Form S-1.

      As a result of the significant time and effort expended by the
Company's management and its outside auditors in connection with the
preparation of the filings referred to above and because the Company is
still in the process of completing the analysis of its results of
operations for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1999, the Company will not
be in a position to file timely its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1999. Nevertheless, the Company does intend
to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter no later
than the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date, as
contemplated by Rule 12b-25(b)(2) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

                                  PART IV
                             OTHER INFORMATION

      (1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
notification:

Steven R. Isko, Esq.             (561)                     912-4100
     (Name)                   (Area Code)            (Telephone Number)

      (2) Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such
shorter period that the registrant was required to file such report(s)
been filed? If the answer is no, identify report(s).

                                                    |X|  Yes   |_| No

      (3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of
operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report
or portion thereof?

                                                    |_| Yes   |X|  No

      If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why
a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.
