AMR CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1.The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial
  statements have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted
  accounting principles for interim financial information and with the
  instructions  to  Form  10-Q  and  Article  10  of  Regulation  S-X.
  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
  required  by  generally accepted accounting principles for  complete
  financial statements.  In the opinion of management, these financial
  statements  contain all adjustments, consisting of normal  recurring
  accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results
  of  operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. Results  of
  operations  for  the  periods presented herein are  not  necessarily
  indicative  of  results  of operations for  the  entire  year.   The
  condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of
  AMR  and  its  wholly  owned subsidiaries, including  its  principal
  subsidiary   American   Airlines,  Inc.  (American).   For   further
  information,  refer  to  the consolidated financial  statements  and
  footnotes thereto included in the AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company)
  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 (2002
  Form  10-K).   Certain amounts from 2002 have been  reclassified  to
  conform with the 2003 presentation.

  The   Company's  Regional  Affiliates  include  two   wholly   owned
  subsidiaries,  American Eagle Airlines, Inc.  (American  Eagle)  and
  Executive Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively, AMR Eagle),  and
  two   independent  carriers,  Trans  States  Airlines,  Inc.  (Trans
  States)  and  Chautauqua  Airlines,  Inc.  (Chautauqua).   In  2002,
  American  had a fixed fee per block hour agreement with  Chautauqua.
  In  2003,  American  had fixed fee per block  hour  agreements  with
  American Eagle, Executive, Trans States and Chautauqua.

2.In  February  2003,  American  asked its  labor  leaders  and  other
  employees  for  approximately  $1.8  billion  in  permanent,  annual
  savings  through  a  combination of changes in wages,  benefits  and
  work  rules.  The requested $1.8 billion in savings was  divided  by
  work  group  as  follows:   $660 million - pilots;  $620  million  -
  Transportation Workers Union represented employees; $340  million  -
  flight attendants; $100 million - management and support staff;  and
  $80  million  -  agents  and representatives.   References  in  this
  document  to  American's  three major  unions  include:  the  Allied
  Pilots Association (the APA); the Transportation Workers Union  (the
  TWU);  and  the  Association of Professional Flight Attendants  (the
  APFA).

  On   March  31,  2003,  American  announced  that  it  had   reached
  agreements  with its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).   It
  also reported various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non-
  unionized  personnel  including officers and other  management  (the
  Management  Reductions).  The anticipated cost savings arising  from
  the  Labor Agreements and the Management Reductions met the targeted
  annual savings of $1.8 billion.

  On  April  16,  2003,  the  Company reported  that  the  members  of
  American's  three  major unions had ratified the  Labor  Agreements.
  Thereafter,  published reports of actions the Company had  taken  in
  2002  to  retain  key executives led two of the unions  to  indicate
  that  they  would  not certify the ratification  process  and  might
  initiate  another  vote  on  the  Labor  Agreements.  The  Company's
  actions  included  (i) the funding of supplemental pension  benefits
  for  the  officers  of  American by means of a  secular  trust  (the
  supplemental pension  benefits provide benefits  the  officers would
  have  received under the terms and conditions of American's  defined
  benefit  plans, but for limitations imposed by ERISA) and  (ii)  the
  execution  of retention agreements whereby American would make  cash
  payments  to  certain  officers in January 2004  and  January  2005.
  Given  the  economic turmoil affecting the Company and the industry,
  in  2002  the  Compensation Committee of the AMR Board of  Directors
  decided  that  it  was  necessary  to  offer  certain  key  officers
  retention  agreements to ensure that the officers  remained  in  the
  employ  of  the  Company for two years. In light of the  controversy
  surrounding   the   retention  agreements,  they  were   voluntarily
  cancelled in April 2003.

  On  April 25, 2003, American announced that it had reached agreement
  with  the leaders of its three major unions on modifications to  the
  Labor  Agreements  (the Modified Labor Agreements).   The  principal
  modifications  were a shorter duration and the ability  to  initiate
  the  process  of re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements  after
  three  years.  Even  with these modifications,  the  Modified  Labor
  Agreements  continue to meet the targeted annual savings.  On  April
  24,  2003,  the  Company announced that its Board of  Directors  had
  accepted  the resignation of Donald J. Carty (Chairman  and  CEO  of
  the  Company and American).  The Company also announced that  Edward
  A.  Brennan  (a Director of the Company since 1987) had  been  named
  Chairman of the Company and that Gerard J. Arpey (President and  COO
  of  the Company and American) had been named CEO and a director.  On
  April  24, 2003 and April 25, 2003, the three major unions certified
  the ratification of the Modified Labor Agreements.

  Of  the  approximately $1.8 billion in savings,  approximately  $1.0
  billion  relate to wage and benefit reductions while  the  remaining
  approximately  $.8 billion will be accomplished through  changes  in
  work  rules  which  will result in additional job  reductions.   The
  Company  expects to incur severance and benefits related charges  in
  connection  with  these  job  reductions  beginning  in  the  second
  quarter  of 2003. The amount of such charges could not be reasonably
  estimated  at  the  time  of the filing  of  this  Form  10-Q.  Wage
  reductions  became effective on April 1, 2003 for officers  and  May
  1,  2003  for  all other employees.  Reductions related to  benefits
  and  work  rule  changes will be phased in over  time.  The  Company
  expects total savings from wages, benefits and work rule changes  to
  be  approximately $200 million in the second quarter of  2003,  $400
  million  in the third quarter of 2003 and $450 million ($1.8 billion
  annually)  in  the  fourth quarter of 2003. In connection  with  the
  changes  in  wages,  benefits and work  rules,  the  Modified  Labor
  Agreements  provide  for  the issuance to  American's  employees  of
  approximately  38 million shares of AMR stock in the form  of  stock
  options  which  will generally vest over a three year  period   (see
  Note 10 for additional information).

  In  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of the Modified  Labor
  Agreements,  the  Company  and American have  reached  concessionary
  agreements  with  certain vendors, lessors,  lenders  and  suppliers
  (the  Vendors,  and  with  the agreements  the  Vendor  Agreements).
  Generally,  under the terms of these Vendor Agreements  the  Company
  or  American will receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for
  certain  goods  and services, and more favorable rent and  financing
  terms  with respect to certain of its aircraft. In return for  these
  concessions the Company anticipates that it will issue over time  up
  to  3.0  million  shares of AMR's common stock to Vendors  who  have
  reached  agreements with the Company. The annual cost  savings  from
  the Vendors are estimated to be in excess of $175 million.

  Even   with   the  Modified  Labor  Agreements,  the  savings   from
  Management  Reductions and the Vendor Agreements,  the  Company  may
  nonetheless need to initiate a filing under Chapter 11 of  the  U.S.
  Bankruptcy  Code  (a  Chapter  11  filing)  because  its   financial
  condition  will  remain  weak  and its prospects  uncertain.   Among
  other  things,  the  following factors have had and/or  may  have  a
  negative  impact  on  the Company's business and financial  results:
  the  continued  weakness of the U. S. economy; the residual  effects
  of  the war in Iraq; the fear of another terrorist attack; the  SARS
  (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak; the inability  of  the
  Company to satisfy the liquidity requirements or other covenants  in
  certain  of its credit arrangements (see Note 11); or the  inability
  of  the  Company  to  access  the  capital  markets  for  additional
  financing.

3.In   April   2003,  the  President  signed  the  Emergency   Wartime
  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act, 2003  (the  Act)  which  includes
  aviation-related  assistance provisions. The Act authorizes  payment
  of  (i) $100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs
  associated  with  the strengthening of flight deck doors  and  locks
  and  (ii)  $2.3  billion  to reimburse air  carriers  for  increased
  security  costs which shall be distributed in proportion to  amounts
  each  has paid or collected as of the date of enactment in passenger
  security  and  air  carrier  security  fees  to  the  Transportation
  Security   Administration.   In  addition,  the  Act  suspends   the
  collection  of  the passenger security fee from June 1,  2003  until
  October  1,  2003 and extends war-risk insurance through August  30,
  2004.   The Act also limits the total cash compensation for the  two
  most   highly  compensated  named  executive  officers  for  certain
  airlines, including the Company, during the period April 1, 2003  to
  April  1, 2004 to the amount of salary received by such officers  in
  2002.   A  violation of this executive compensation provision  would
  require  the carrier to repay the government for the amount  of  its
  reimbursement  for  increased security costs as  described  in  item
  (ii)  above.  The  Company does not anticipate any  difficulties  in
  complying  with  this  limitation  on  executive  compensation.  The
  Company  estimates that its reimbursement under the  Act,  excluding
  the  impact  of suspending the security fee from June 1, 2003  until
  October  1,  2003,  will be in the range of  $340  million  to  $360
  million.   This  reimbursement will be recorded as  a  reduction  to
  operating expenses. The Company's compensation for the direct  costs
  associated  with strengthening cockpit doors will be recorded  as  a
  reduction   to  capitalized  flight  equipment.   The  reimbursement
  payment   from  the  government  is  expected  in  May   2003;   the
  compensation payment is expected sometime this summer.

4.The  Company  accounts  for its stock-based  compensation  plans  in
  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion   No.   25,
  "Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees" (APB  25)  and  related
  Interpretations.    Under  APB  25,  no  compensation   expense   is
  recognized  for  stock option grants if the exercise  price  of  the
  Company's  stock option grants is at or above the fair market  value
  of  the  underlying  stock on the date of grant.   The  Company  has
  adopted  the pro forma disclosure features of Statement of Financial
  Accounting   Standards   No.   123,  "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
  Compensation"  (SFAS  123),  as amended by  Statement  of  Financial
  Accounting   Standards   No.   148,  "Accounting   for   Stock-Based

5.In  2001,  the  Company recorded fleet impairment and other  special
  charges  related to the events of September 11, 2001.  In 2002,  the
  Company   recorded  fleet  impairments  and  other  special  charges
  related  to  initiatives  to  reduce  costs,  reduce  capacity   and
  simplify  its  aircraft  fleet.   Furthermore,  as  a  part  of  its
  restructuring  initiatives,  the Company  incurred  $25  million  in
  severance  charges in the first quarter of 2003, which are  included
  in  Wages,  salaries and benefits in the consolidated  statement  of

6.The  Company has restricted cash and short-term investments  related
  to  projected  workers' compensation obligations and  various  other
  obligations.  As of March 31, 2003, projected workers'  compensation
  obligations   were  secured  by  restricted  cash   and   short-term
  investments  of  $386  million and various  other  obligations  were
  secured  by  restricted  cash  and short-term  investments  of  $164
  million.  In  the first quarter of 2003, the Company  redeemed  $339
  million  of tax-exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters  of
  credit   secured  by  restricted  cash  and  short-term  investments
  resulting   in  a  reduction  in  restricted  cash  and   short-term
  investments.  Of  the  $339 million of tax-exempt  bonds  that  were
  redeemed,  $253  million  were accounted for  as  operating  leases.
  Payments  to redeem these tax-exempt special facility revenue  bonds
  are  considered  prepaid  facility rentals and  will  reduce  future
  operating  lease  commitments.  The remaining $86  million  of  tax-
  exempt  bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt and  had
  original maturities in 2014 through 2024.

  As  of March 31, 2003 the Company has approximately $251 million  in
  fuel  prepayments  and credit card holdback deposits  classified  as
  Other current assets and Other assets.

7.As  of  March  31, 2003, the Company had commitments to acquire  the
  following  aircraft: two Boeing 777-200 ERs, six Boeing  767-300ERs,
  18  Embraer regional jets and eight Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2003;  an
  aggregate of 74 Embraer regional jets and seven Bombardier  CRJ-700s
  in  2004  through 2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing  737-800s  and
  nine  Boeing  777-200ERs in 2006 through 2010.  Future payments  for
  all  aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation,
  will  approximate $792 million during the remainder  of  2003,  $753
  million  in  2004,  $694  million  in  2005  and  an  aggregate   of
  approximately  $2.6  billion in 2006 through  2010.  Boeing  Capital
  Corporation has agreed to provide backstop financing for all  Boeing
  aircraft  deliveries in 2003.  In return, American granted Boeing  a
  security  interest in certain advance payments previously  made  and
  in  certain  rights  under the aircraft purchase  agreement  between
  American  and  Boeing.   In addition, the Company  has  pre-arranged
  financing  or  backstop financing for all of its  2003  Embraer  and
  Bombardier  aircraft  deliveries and a  portion  of  its  post  2003
  deliveries.

  As  discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
  included  in  the  Company's 2002 Form 10-K, Miami-Dade  County  is
  currently   investigating  and  remediating  various  environmental
  conditions at the Miami International Airport (MIA) and funding the
  remediation  costs through landing fees and various  cost  recovery
  methods.   American  and AMR Eagle have been named  as  potentially
  responsible  parties (PRPs) for the contamination at  MIA.   During
  the  second quarter of 2001, the County filed a lawsuit against  17
  defendants, including American, in an attempt to recover  its  past
  and  future  cleanup costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida  v.  Advance
  Cargo  Services,  Inc., et al. in the Florida Circuit  Court).   In
  addition  to  the  17  defendants named in the lawsuit,  243  other
  agencies and companies were also named as PRPs and contributors  to
  the  contamination.   American's and AMR  Eagle's  portion  of  the
  cleanup  costs  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  due  to  various
  factors, including the unknown extent of the remedial actions  that
  may be required, the proportion of the cost that will ultimately be
  recovered from the responsible parties, and uncertainties regarding
  the  environmental  agencies  that will  ultimately  supervise  the
  remedial  activities  and  the  nature  of  that  supervision.   In
  addition, the Company is subject to environmental issues at various
  other  airport and non-airport locations for which it  has  accrued
  $89   million  at  March  31,  2003.   Management  believes,  after
  considering  a number of factors, that the ultimate disposition  of
  these environmental issues is not expected to materially affect the
  Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or
  cash flows.  Amounts recorded for environmental issues are based on
  the  Company's  current  assessments of the ultimate  outcome  and,
  accordingly,  could  increase  or  decrease  as  these  assessments
  change.

8.Accumulated  depreciation of owned equipment and property  at  March
  31,  2003  and December 31, 2002 was $8.7 billion and $8.4  billion,
  respectively.   Accumulated amortization of equipment  and  property
  under  capital leases at March 31, 2003 and December  31,  2002  was
  $1.0 billion and $974 million, respectively.

9.The Company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as
  a  result generated certain net operating losses available to offset
  future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,
  a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the
  Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company
  provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
  likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets
  will not be realized.  During the first quarter of 2003, the Company
  continued to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax
  assets, which results in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax
  losses.   The  Company's  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  allowance
  increased $383 million in the first quarter of 2003, to $753 million
  as of March 31, 2003.

10. In  March  2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance
  of  additional shares of AMR common stock to employees  and  Vendors
  in  connection with ongoing negotiations concerning concessions. The
  maximum  number of shares authorized for issuance was 30 percent  of
  the  number  of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding  on
  March  24, 2003 (156,359,955) or approximately 46.9 million  shares.
  From  the  foregoing authorization, the Company expects to issue  up
  to  3.0  million  shares to Vendors.  Also in March  2003,  the  AMR
  Board  of  Directors adopted the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive  Plan
  (2003   Plan)   to   provide  equity  awards  to   employees  in
  connection with wage, benefit and work rule concessions.   Under
  the  2003 Plan, all American employees are eligible to receive stock
  awards  which  may  include  stock  options,  restricted  stock  and
  deferred   stock.   In  April  2003,  the  Company   reached   final
  agreements  with  the  unions representing American  employees  (the
  Modified  Labor  Agreements, see Note 2).  In  connection  with  the
  changes  in  wages,  benefits and work  rules,  the  Modified  Labor
  Agreements provide for the issuance of up to 37.9 million shares  of
  AMR  stock  in  the  form  of  stock options.   On  April  17,  2003
  approximately 37.9 million stock options were granted  to  employees
  at  an  exercise  price of $5.00 per share, which is  equal  to  the
  closing  price of AMR's common stock (NYSE) on that date (the  grant
  date).   These  shares will vest over a three-year period  and  will
  expire  no later than April 17, 2013. These options were granted  to
  members  of the APA, the TWU, the APFA, agents, other non-management
  personnel and management employees.

11.During  the three-month period ended March 31, 2003,  American
  and  AMR  Eagle  borrowed approximately $214 million  under  various
  debt  agreements which are secured by aircraft.  Effective  interest
  rates  on  these  agreements are fixed or variable based  on  London
  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR) plus  a  spread  and  mature  over
  various  periods of time through 2019.  As of March  31,  2003,  the
  effective  interest  rate  on these agreements  ranged  up  to  8.81
  percent.

  American  has  a  fully  drawn  $834 million  credit  facility  that
  expires  December 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain
  lenders  in  such facility entered into a waiver and amendment  that
  (i)  waived,  until  May  15,  2003, the requirement  that  American
  pledge  additional  collateral  to  the  extent  the  value  of  the
  existing  collateral  was  insufficient  under  the  terms  of   the
  facility, (ii) waived American's liquidity covenant for the  quarter
  ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)  modified  the  financial  covenants
  applicable  to subsequent periods, and (iv) increased the applicable
  margin  for advances under the facility.  On May 15, 2003,  American
  expects  to  pledge  an  additional 30 (non-Section  1110  eligible)
  aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of March 31, 2003  of
  approximately  $451  million.  Pursuant to  the  modified  financial
  covenants,  American is required to maintain at least  $1.0  billion
  of   liquidity,  consisting  of  unencumbered  cash  and  short-term
  investments,  for  the  second quarter 2003  and  beyond.   At  this
  point,  it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to  satisfy
  this liquidity requirement.

  In  addition,  the  required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed  charges  has
  been  decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004,  and  the
  next  test  of  such cash flow coverage ratio will not  occur  until
  March  31,  2004.  The amendment also provided for a 50 basis  point
  increase  in  the  applicable margin over  LIBOR,  resulting  in  an
  effective  interest  rate (as of March 31, 2003)  of  4.73  percent.
  The  interest  rate will be reset again on September 17,  2003.   At
  American's  option, interest on the facility can  be  calculated  on
  one  of  several  different  bases.  For most  borrowings,  American
  would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR.

  As   of   March  31,  2003,  AMR  has  issued  guarantees   covering
  approximately  $935 million of American's tax-exempt bond  debt  and
  American  has issued guarantees covering approximately $636  million
  of  AMR's  unsecured debt.  In addition, as of March 31,  2003,  AMR
  and  American  have  issued guarantees covering  approximately  $521
  million of AMR Eagle's secured debt.

12.Financial  Accounting Standards Board Interpretation  No.  46,
  "Consolidation  of  Variable Interest Entities" (Interpretation  46)
  requires  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest  entity  to
  include  the  assets, liabilities, and results of the activities  of
  the   variable   interest  entity  in  its  consolidated   financial
  statements,  as well as disclosure of information about  the  assets
  and   liabilities,  and  the  nature,  purpose  and  activities   of
  consolidated    variable    interest    entities.    In    addition,
  Interpretation  46  requires disclosure  of  information  about  the
  nature,  purpose and activities of unconsolidated variable  interest
  entities   in  which  the  Company  holds  a  significant   variable
  interest.    The  provisions  of  Interpretation  46  are  effective
  immediately  for  any  variable  interest  entities  acquired  after
  January  31,  2003 and effective beginning in the third  quarter  of
  2003 for all variable interest entities acquired before February  1,
  2003.  This  interpretation  has had  no  impact  on  the  Company's
  consolidated  statement  of  operations  or  condensed  consolidated
  balance  sheets. Special facility revenue bonds have been issued  by
  certain  municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and  improve
  airport facilities that are leased by American and accounted for  as
  operating  leases.  Approximately $2.1 billion of these bonds  (with
  total future payments of approximately $5.7 billion as of March  31,
  2003)  are  guaranteed  by American, AMR, or both.  The  Company  is
  currently  evaluating  the applicability  of  Interpretation  46  to
  these  airport  lease arrangements and the possible  impact  on  its
  future  consolidated results of operations and consolidated  balance
  sheet.

  "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for  Guarantees,
  Including   Indirect   Guarantees   of   Indebtedness   of   Others"
  (Interpretation  45)  requires disclosures  in  interim  and  annual
  financial  statements  about obligations  under  certain  guarantees
  issued  by the Company. Furthermore, it requires recognition at  the
  beginning  of a guarantee of a liability for the fair value  of  the
  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee,  with   limited
  exceptions  including:  1) a parent's guarantee  of  a  subsidiary's
  debt  to a third party, and 2) a subsidiary's guarantee of the  debt
  owed to a third party by either its parent or another subsidiary  of
  that  parent.  The  disclosure requirements are effective  for  this
  filing  and  have  been  included  in  Notes  6,  7  and  8  to  the
  consolidated  financial  statements  in  the  2002  Form  10-K.  The
  initial  recognition  and initial measurement  provisions  are  only

  the  Company's  consolidated statement of  operations  or  condensed
  consolidated balance sheets.

  Intangible  Assets" (SFAS 142).  SFAS 142 requires  the  Company  to
  test  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible  assets  (for  AMR,
  route  acquisition costs) for impairment rather than amortize  them.
  In  2002,  the  Company completed an impairment analysis  for  route
  acquisition costs in accordance with SFAS 142. The analysis did  not
  result  in an impairment charge.  In addition, the Company completed
  an  impairment analysis related to its $1.4 billion of goodwill  and
  determined  the Company's entire goodwill balance was impaired.   In
  arriving  at  this  conclusion, the Company's  net  book  value  was
  determined  to be in excess of the Company's fair value  at  January
  1,  2002,  using AMR as the reporting unit for purposes of the  fair
  value  determination. The Company determined its fair  value  as  of
  January   1,   2002  using  various  valuation  methods,  ultimately
  utilizing  market  capitalization as the primary indicator  of  fair
  value.   As  a  result,  the Company recorded a  one-time,  non-cash
  charge,  effective  January  1, 2002, of  $988  million  ($6.38  per
  share,  net  of a tax benefit of $363 million) to write-off  all  of
  AMR's  goodwill.   This charge is nonoperational in  nature  and  is
  reflected  as  a  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change  in  the
  consolidated statements of operations.

14.The Company includes unrealized gains and losses on available-
  for-sale  securities,  changes in minimum  pension  liabilities  and
  changes   in   the  fair  value  of  certain  derivative   financial
  instruments  that  qualify  for hedge  accounting  in  comprehensive
  loss.   For  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2003  and  2002,
  comprehensive  loss  was  $(1,063)  million  and  $(1,488)  million,
  respectively.   The  difference between net loss  and  comprehensive
  loss  for  the  three months ended March 31, 2003 and  2002  is  due
  primarily  to the accounting for the Company's derivative  financial
  instruments  under Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards  No.
  133,    "Accounting   for   Derivative   Instruments   and   Hedging
  Activities", as amended.

Item  2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
           and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2003 and 2002

Summary  AMR  Corporation's (AMR or the Company) net loss  during  the
first  quarter  of  2003  was $1.0 billion, or  $6.68  per  share,  as
compared  to a net loss of $1.6 billion, or $10.09 per share  for  the
same period in 2002.  The Company's first quarter 2002 results include
a  one-time,  non-cash  charge to record the cumulative  effect  of  a
change  in accounting, effective January 1, 2002, of $988 million,  or
$6.38  per share, to write-off all of AMR's goodwill upon the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142 "Goodwill
and   Other   Intangible  Assets"  (see  Note  13  to  the   condensed
consolidated  financial  statements).  AMR's operating  loss  of  $869
million  increased $140 million compared to the same period  in  2002.
AMR's principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American).

The  Company's first quarter 2003 revenues continued to decrease year-
over-year.  The Company's revenues continue to be negatively  impacted
by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines and
changes in business traveler profiles; the geographic distribution  of
the  Company's  network;  and  reduced fares  due  in  large  part  to
increased  competition from low-cost carriers.   The  Company's  first
quarter 2003 revenues were also negatively impacted by the war in Iraq
and  the  outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS).   The
Company's  revenues  decreased  approximately  $43  million,  or   1.0
percent,  to $4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 from  the  same
period  last  year.  American's passenger revenues  decreased  by  2.6
percent,  or $90 million, in the first three months of 2003  from  the
same  period in 2002.  American's domestic revenue per available  seat
mile  (RASM)  decreased  3.2 percent, to 8.43  cents,  on  a  capacity
increase of 1.8 percent, to 28.8 billion available seat miles  (ASMs).
International  RASM  decreased to 8.43 cents, or  2.7  percent,  on  a
capacity increase of 6.5 percent.  The decrease in international  RASM
was due to a 26.4 percent decrease in Pacific RASM slightly offset  by
a  1.0 percent increase in European RASM. Latin American RASM remained
flat.  The  increase in international capacity was driven  by  a  52.4
percent  and  9.8  percent  increase in  Pacific  and  European  ASMs,
respectively,  slightly  offset by a 1.5 percent  reduction  in  Latin
American ASMs.

The   Company's   Regional  Affiliates  include   two   wholly   owned
subsidiaries,  American  Eagle Airlines,  Inc.  (American  Eagle)  and
Executive  Airlines, Inc. (Executive) (collectively, AMR  Eagle),  and
two  independent carriers, Trans States Airlines, Inc. (Trans  States)
and  Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua).  In 2002, American had  a
fixed  fee  per  block  hour agreement with  Chautauqua,  and  prorate
agreements  with  AMR Eagle and Trans States.  In 2003,  American  had
fixed  fee per block hour agreements with all three carriers. The  net
effect  of the change in the form of the agreements was flat  revenue.
Regional  Affiliates'  traffic increased 14.0 percent  while  capacity
increased  15.0  percent, to approximately 2.0 billion  ASMs.  Certain
amounts   from   2002  related  to  Regional  Affiliates   have   been
reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.

Other  revenues increased 21.5 percent, or $47 million, due  primarily
to  increases  in  ticket  change fees coupled  with  changes  to  the
Company's  change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases  in
airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increases
in AAdvantage fees.

The  Company's  operating  expenses  increased  2.0  percent,  or  $97
million.  Wages, salaries and benefits increased 2.1 percent,  or  $43
million,  primarily due to increases in pension and  health  insurance
costs and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built
into  the  Company's  labor contracts, offset by a  reduction  in  the
average  number  of employees.  Aircraft fuel expense  increased  38.3
percent, or $202 million, due primarily to a 39.9 percent increase  in
American's average price per gallon of fuel. Commissions, booking fees
and  credit  card expense decreased 20.3 percent, or $65 million,  due
primarily  to commission structure changes implemented in  March  2002
and  a  2.4  percent  decrease  in passenger  revenues.   Maintenance,
materials  and  repairs decreased 13.2 percent, or  $35  million,  due
primarily  to  a  decrease  in airframe  and  engine  volumes  at  the
Company's  maintenance  bases resulting  from  a  variety  of  factors
including  the retirement of aircraft, the timing of engines returning
from  repair vendors and a decrease in the number of flights; and  the
receipt  of  certain vendor credits.  Aircraft rentals  decreased  $36
million, or 15.9 percent, due primarily to lease expirations  and  the
removal  of  leased  aircraft from service  in  prior  periods.   Food
service  decreased  12.4  percent, or $21 million,  due  primarily  to
reductions in the level of food service.

                                    -12-
<Page> 15
Other  income  (expense), historically a net  expense,  increased  $40
million  due to the following: Interest income decreased 27.8 percent,
or  $5  million,  due  primarily to decreasing  short-term  investment
balances.   Interest expense increased $26 million, or  15.7  percent,
resulting primarily from the increase in the Company's long-term debt.
Miscellaneous-net increased 75.0 percent, or $6 million,  due  to  the
write-down of certain investments held by the Company during the first
quarter of 2003.

The  Company has experienced significant cumulative losses  and  as  a
result  generated  certain net operating losses  available  to  offset
future taxes payable.  As a result of the cumulative operating losses,
a  valuation allowance was established against the full amount of  the
Company's net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2002.  The Company
provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
likely  than not that some portion or all of its deferred  tax  assets
will  not  be realized.  During the first quarter of 2003 the  Company
continued to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax
assets, which results in no tax benefit being recorded for the  pretax
losses.    The  Company's  deferred  tax  asset  valuation   allowance
increased  $383 million in the first quarter of 2003, to $753  million
as of March 31, 2003.

The  effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2002  was
impacted  by  a  $27  million charge resulting  from  a  provision  in
Congress'  economic  stimulus  package that  changed  the  period  for
carrybacks  of net operating losses (NOLs).  This change  allowed  the
Company  to carry back 2001 and 2002 NOLs for five years, rather  than
two years under the previous law, allowing the Company to more quickly
recover  its NOLs.  The extended NOL carryback did however  result  in
the  displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years.   These
credits  are  now  expected to expire before  being  utilized  by  the
Company, resulting in this charge.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

In February 2003, American asked its labor leaders and other employees
for approximately $1.8 billion in permanent, annual savings through  a
combination  of  changes  in  wages, benefits  and  work  rules.   The
requested  $1.8  billion  in savings was  divided  by  work  group  as
follows:  $660 million - pilots; $620 million - Transportation Workers
Union  represented employees; $340 million - flight  attendants;  $100
million  - management and support staff; and $80 million - agents  and
representatives.   References  in this document  to  American's  three
major  unions  include: the Allied Pilots Association (the  APA);  the
Transportation  Workers  Union  (the  TWU);  and  the  Association  of
Professional Flight Attendants (the APFA).

On  March  31, 2003, American announced that it had reached agreements
with  its three major unions (the Labor Agreements).  It also reported
various  changes  in  the  pay  plans and benefits  for  non-unionized
personnel  including  officers and other  management  (the  Management
Reductions).   The  anticipated cost savings arising  from  the  Labor
Agreements  and  the  Management Reductions met  the  targeted  annual
savings of $1.8 billion.

On April 16, 2003, the Company reported that the members of American's
three  major  unions  had ratified the Labor Agreements.   Thereafter,
published  reports of actions the Company had taken in 2002 to  retain
key  executives led two of the unions to indicate that they would  not
certify  the ratification process and might initiate another  vote  on
the  Labor Agreements. The Company's actions included (i) the  funding
of supplemental pension benefits for the officers of American by means
of  a  secular trust (the supplemental pension benefits provide benefits
the  officers  would have received under the terms and  conditions  of
American's  defined  benefit  plans, but for  limitations  imposed  by
ERISA) and (ii) the execution of retention agreements whereby American
would  make  cash  payments to certain officers in  January  2004  and
January 2005. Given the economic turmoil affecting the Company and the
industry,  in  2002 the Compensation Committee of  the  AMR  Board  of
Directors decided that it was necessary to offer certain key  officers
retention  agreements  to  ensure that the officers  remained  in  the
employ  of  the  Company for two years. In light  of  the  controversy
surrounding the retention agreements, they were voluntarily  cancelled
in April 2003.

                                 -14-

<Page> 17
On  April  25, 2003, American announced that it had reached  agreement
with  the  leaders of its three major unions on modifications  to  the
Labor  Agreements  (the  Modified Labor  Agreements).   The  principal
modifications were a shorter duration and the ability to initiate  the
process  of  re-negotiating the Modified Labor Agreements after  three
years.   Even with these modifications, the Modified Labor  Agreements
continue to meet the targeted annual savings.  On April 24, 2003,  the
Company  announced  that  its  Board of  Directors  had  accepted  the
resignation  of Donald J. Carty (Chairman and CEO of the  Company  and
American).   The  Company also announced that  Edward  A.  Brennan  (a
Director  of  the Company since 1987) had been named Chairman  of  the
Company and that Gerard J. Arpey (President and COO of the Company and
American)  had been named CEO and a director.  On April 24,  2003  and
April  25, 2003, the three major unions certified the ratification  of
the Modified Labor Agreements.

Of  the  approximately  $1.8  billion in savings,  approximately  $1.0
billion  relate  to  wage and benefit reductions while  the  remaining
approximately $.8 billion will be accomplished through changes in work
rules  which  will result in additional job reductions.   The  Company
expects  to incur severance and benefits related charges in connection
with these job reductions beginning in the second quarter of 2003. The
amount  of such charges could not be reasonably estimated at the  time
of  the filing of this Form 10-Q. Wage reductions became effective  on
April  1,  2003 for officers and May 1, 2003 for all other  employees.
Reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in
over time.  The Company expects total savings from wages, benefits and
work  rule  changes  to be approximately $200 million  in  the  second
quarter  of 2003, $400 million in the third quarter of 2003  and  $450
million  ($1.8  billion annually) in the fourth quarter  of  2003.  In
connection  with  the changes in wages, benefits and work  rules,  the
Modified Labor Agreements provide for the issuance of approximately 38
million  shares of AMR stock in the form of stock options  which  will
generally vest over a three year period  (see Note 10 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional information).

In  addition,  subsequent to the ratification of  the  Modified  Labor
Agreements,  the  Company  and  American  have  reached  concessionary
agreements  with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers  (the
Vendors,  and with the agreements the Vendor Agreements).   Generally,
under  the  terms of these Vendor Agreements the Company  or  American
will  receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods
and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect
to  certain  of  its  aircraft. In return for  these  concessions  the
Company  anticipates that it will issue over time up  to  3.0  million
shares  of  AMR's common stock to Vendors who have reached  agreements
with  the  Company.  The  annual cost savings  from  the  Vendors  are
estimated to be in excess of $175 million.

Even  with  the Modified Labor Agreements, the savings from Management
Reductions and the Vendor Agreements, the Company may nonetheless need
to  initiate a filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code  (a
Chapter  11  filing) because its financial condition will remain  weak
and  its  prospects  uncertain.  Among  other  things,  the  following
factors  have  had and/or may have a negative impact on the  Company's
business and financial results:  the continued weakness of the  U.  S.
economy; the residual effects of the war in Iraq; the fear of  another
terrorist   attack;  the  SARS  (Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome)
outbreak;  the  inability  of the Company  to  satisfy  the  liquidity
requirements  or other covenants in certain of its credit arrangements
(see  Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements);  or
the  inability  of  the  Company to access  the  capital  markets  for
additional financing.

During 2001 and 2002, the Company raised approximately $8.3 billion of
funding  to finance capital commitments and to fund operating  losses.
The Company expects that it will continue to need to raise significant
additional financing in the near future to cover its liquidity  needs,
until  such time as (i) the cost initiatives discussed in the previous
paragraphs  become  fully effective and (ii) the  Company  returns  to
profitability.   The  Company  had  approximately  $1.3   billion   in
unrestricted  cash and short-term investments as of  March  31,  2003.
The  Company  also  had available possible future  financing  sources,
including,  but  not  limited to: (i) a limited amount  of  additional
secured  aircraft  debt,  (ii) sale-leaseback  transactions  of  owned
property, including aircraft and real estate, (iii) securitization  of
future operating receipts, and (iv) the potential sale of certain non-
core assets (including the Company's interests in AMR Investments  and
Worldspan,  a  computer  reservations systems partnership).   However,
these  financing sources may not be available to the Company in  light
of  its financial condition.  To the extent that the Company is unable
to  access  capital markets and raise additional capital, the  Company
will be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations.

In April 2003, the President signed the Emergency Wartime Supplemental
Appropriations  Act,  2003  (the Act) which includes  aviation-related
assistance provisions. The Act authorizes payment of (i) $100  million
to  compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated  with  the
strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and (ii) $2.3 billion  to
reimburse  air  carriers for increased security costs which  shall  be
distributed in proportion to amounts each has paid or collected as  of
the  date  of enactment in passenger security and air carrier security
fees to the Transportation Security Administration.  In addition,  the
Act suspends the collection of the passenger security fee from June 1,
2003  until  October  1, 2003 and extends war-risk  insurance  through
August 30, 2004.  The Act also limits the total cash compensation  for
the  two  most highly compensated named executive officers for certain
airlines,  including the Company, during the period April 1,  2003  to
April  1,  2004 to the amount of salary received by such  officers  in
2002.   A  violation  of this executive compensation  provision  would
require  the  carrier to repay the government for the  amount  of  its
reimbursement for increased security costs as described in  item  (ii)
above.  The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in  complying
with  this limitation on executive compensation. The Company estimates
that  its  reimbursement  under  the  Act,  excluding  the  impact  of
suspending the security fee from June 1, 2003 until October  1,  2003,
will  be  in  the  range  of  $340  million  to  $360  million.   This
reimbursement  will be recorded as a reduction to operating  expenses.
The  Company's  compensation  for the  direct  costs  associated  with
strengthening  cockpit  doors  will be  recorded  as  a  reduction  to
capitalized  flight  equipment.  The reimbursement  payment  from  the
government  is  expected  in  May 2003; the  compensation  payment  is
expected sometime this summer.

AMR  and  American's credit ratings are significantly below investment
grade.  In  January  2003, Standard & Poor's and  Moody's  placed  the
credit  ratings  of  AMR  and American on review  for  downgrade.   In
February  2003,  Moody's further downgraded the senior implied  rating
for AMR, the senior unsecured ratings of both AMR and American and the
ratings of most of American's secured debt. The Moody's ratings remain
on  review for possible downgrade.  Also in February 2003, Standard  &
Poor's lowered its long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and
American,  lowered the senior secured and unsecured  debt  ratings  of
AMR,  and  lowered  the  secured debt rating of American.   American's
short-term  rating was withdrawn.  Ratings on most of American's  non-
enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered.  In addition,
Standard  &  Poor's revised the CreditWatch implications to developing
from  negative. In March 2003, Standard & Poor's further  lowered  its
long-term corporate credit ratings for both AMR and American,  lowered
the  senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of AMR, and lowered the
secured  debt  rating of American. Ratings on most of American's  non-
enhanced  equipment  trust  certificates  were  also  lowered.   These
reductions  have  increased the Company's borrowing costs.  Additional
significant  reductions in AMR's or American's  credit  ratings  would
further increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the
availability  of  future  financing. Also in March  2003,  Standard  &
Poor's removed AMR's common stock from the S&P 500 index.

American  has a fully drawn $834 million credit facility that  expires
December 15, 2005.  On March 31, 2003, American and certain lenders in
such  facility  entered into a waiver and amendment that  (i)  waived,
until  May  15, 2003, the requirement that American pledge  additional
collateral  to  the  extent the value of the existing  collateral  was
insufficient  under the terms of the facility, (ii) waived  American's
liquidity  covenant  for  the  quarter ended  March  31,  2003,  (iii)
modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and
(iv)  increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility.
On  May  15, 2003, American expects to pledge an additional  30  (non-
Section 1110 eligible) aircraft having an aggregate net book value  as
of  March  31,  2003 of approximately $451 million.  Pursuant  to  the
modified  financial  covenants, American is required  to  maintain  at
least  $1.0 billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash  and
short-term  investments, for the second quarter 2003 and  beyond.   At
this  point,  it  is uncertain whether the Company  will  be  able  to
satisfy this liquidity requirement.

In  addition, the required ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges has  been
decreased until the period ending December 31, 2004, and the next test
of  such cash flow coverage ratio will not occur until March 31, 2004.
The  amendment  also provided for a 50 basis points  increase  in  the
applicable  margin  over the London Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR),
resulting in an effective interest rate (as of March 31, 2003) of 4.73
percent.  The interest rate will be reset again on September 17, 2003.
At  American's  option, interest on the facility can be calculated  on
one  of several different bases.  For most borrowings, American  would
anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon LIBOR.

The Company has restricted cash and short-term investments related  to
projected   workers'  compensation  obligations  and   various   other
obligations.  As  of  March 31, 2003, projected workers'  compensation
obligations were secured by restricted cash and short-term investments
of  $386  million  and  various  other  obligations  were  secured  by
restricted  cash  and short-term investments of $164 million.  In  the
first quarter of 2003, the Company redeemed $339 million of tax-exempt
bonds  that  were  backed  by standby letters  of  credit  secured  by
restricted cash and short-term investments resulting in a reduction in
restricted cash and short-term investments. Of the $339 million of tax-
exempt  bonds that were redeemed, $253 million were accounted  for  as
operating  leases.   Payments  to  redeem  these  tax-exempt   special
facility  revenue  bonds are considered prepaid facility  rentals  and
will  reduce  future operating lease commitments.  The  remaining  $86
million of tax-exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted  for  as
debt and had original maturities in 2014 through 2024.

As  of  March 31, 2003 the Company has approximately $251  million  in
fuel prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as Other
current assets and Other assets.

Net cash used for operating activities in the three-month period ended
March  31, 2003 was $321 million, a decrease of $126 million over  the
same  period  in  2002.   Included in  net  cash  used  for  operating
activities  was  the  receipt of a $572 million  federal  tax  refund.
Capital  expenditures for the first three months  of  2003  were  $393
million, and included the acquisition of three Boeing 767-300ERs, four
Embraer  140s  and  two  Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft.   These  capital
expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt
agreements.

During  the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, American and  AMR
Eagle   borrowed  approximately  $214  million  under   various   debt
agreements which are secured by aircraft.  Effective interest rates on
these  agreements are fixed or variable based on LIBOR plus  a  spread
and mature over various periods of time through 2019.  As of March 31,
2003,  the  effective interest rate on these agreements ranged  up  to
8.81 percent.

As  of  March  31, 2003, the Company had commitments  to  acquire  the
following aircraft: two Boeing 777-200 ERs, six Boeing 767-300ERs,  18
Embraer  regional  jets  and eight Bombardier  CRJ-700s  in  2003;  an
aggregate of 74 Embraer regional jets and seven Bombardier CRJ-700s in
2004  through  2006; and an aggregate of 47 Boeing 737-800s  and  nine
Boeing  777-200ERs  in  2006 through 2010.  Future  payments  for  all
aircraft,  including the estimated amounts for price escalation,  will
approximate $792 million during the remainder of 2003, $753 million in
2004,  $694  million  in 2005 and an aggregate of  approximately  $2.6
billion in 2006 through 2010. Boeing Capital Corporation has agreed to
provide backstop financing for all Boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003.
In  return, American has granted Boeing a security interest in certain
advance  payments  previously made and in  certain  rights  under  the
aircraft purchase agreement between American and Boeing.  In addition,
the  Company has pre-arranged financing or backstop financing for  all
of  its  2003 Embraer and Bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion
of its post 2003 deliveries.

Special   facility   revenue  bonds  have  been  issued   by   certain
municipalities  primarily to purchase equipment  and  improve  airport
facilities that are leased by American and accounted for as  operating
leases.  Approximately $2.1 billion of these bonds (with total  future
payments  of  approximately $5.7 billion as of  March  31,  2003)  are
guaranteed  by American, AMR, or both.  These guarantees can  only  be
invoked  in  the  event American defaults on the lease obligation  and
certain  other remedies are not available.  Approximately $740 million
of  these  special  facility revenue bonds  contain  mandatory  tender
provisions  that require American to repurchase the bonds  at  various
times  through 2008, including $200 million in November 2003. Although
American has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance
that  these  bonds will be successfully remarketed.  Any  payments  to
redeem  or  purchase  bonds  that are not  remarketed  would  also  be
considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future  operating
lease commitments.

OTHER INFORMATION

In  March 2003, the Board of Directors of AMR approved the issuance of
additional  shares  of AMR common stock to employees  and  Vendors  in
connection  with  ongoing  negotiations  concerning  concessions.  The
maximum number of shares authorized for issuance was 30 percent of the
number  of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding  on  March
24,  2003 (156,359,955) or approximately 46.9 million shares. From the
foregoing  authorization,  the Company expects  to  issue  up  to  3.0
million  shares  to Vendors.  Also in March 2003,  the  AMR  Board  of
Directors  adopted the 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (2003  Plan)
to provide equity awards to employees in  connection  with  wage,
benefit  and work rule concessions.  Under the 2003 Plan, all American
employees are eligible to receive stock awards which may include stock
options,  restricted stock and deferred stock.   In  April  2003,  the
Company reached final agreements with the unions representing American
employees  (the Modified Labor Agreements, see Note 2 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements). In connection with the changes in
wages, benefits and work rules, the Modified Labor Agreements  provide
for the issuance of up to 37.9 million  shares  of AMR stock in  the
form  of  stock  options. On April 17, 2003 approximately 37.9 million
stock options were granted to employees at an  exercise price of $5.00
per share, which is equal to the  closing price of  AMR's common stock
(NYSE) on that date (the  grant  date). These  shares will vest over a
three-year period and will  expire no later than April 17, 2013. These
options were granted to members of the APA, the TWU, the APFA, agents,
other non-management personnel and management employees.

A provision in the scope clause of American's former contract with the
Allied Pilots Associations (APA) limited the number of available  seat
miles  (ASMs)  and  block hours that could be flown  under  American's
marketing  code  (AA)  by American's regional  carrier  partners  when
American  pilots are on furlough (the so-called ASM cap).   To  ensure
that  American remained in compliance with the ASM cap,  American  and
American Eagle took several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of ASMs
flown  by  American's wholly-owned commuter air carriers.  As  one  of
those  measures, AMR Eagle signed a letter of intent to sell Executive
Airlines, its San Juan-based subsidiary.

Another  provision in the former APA contract limited to 67 the  total
number  of regional jets with more than 44 seats that could  be  flown
under  the  AA  code by American's regional carrier partners.  As  AMR
Eagle  continued to accept previously-ordered Bombardier  and  Embraer
regional  jets  this cap would have been reached  in  early  2003.  To
ensure that American remained in compliance with the 67-aircraft  cap,
AMR  Eagle  reached  an  agreement to dispose of  14  Embraer  ERJ-145
aircraft from its fleet.  Trans States Airlines, an AmericanConnection
carrier, agreed to acquire these aircraft.   Under the former contract
between  AA and the APA, Trans States would have had to operate  these
aircraft under its AX code, rather than the AA* code, at its St. Louis
hub.

The   Labor  Agreement  with  the  APA  (one  of  the  Modified  Labor
Agreements),  ratified in April 2003, modified the provisions  in  the
APA contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs  to
give  the Company more flexibility with its American Eagle operations.
The limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reduced
and  are  now tied to 110 percent of the size of American's narrowbody
aircraft  fleet.  As a consequence of these modifications,  it  is  no
longer  necessary to use the AX marketing code on flights operated  by
Trans States as the AmericanConnection, and AMR Eagle has discontinued
its plans to sell Executive Airlines.

PART II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

On  July  26, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed, and in  November
1999 an amended complaint was filed, against AMR Corporation, American
Airlines,  Inc.,  AMR  Eagle Holding Corporation,  Airlines  Reporting
Corporation,  and the Sabre Group Holdings, Inc. in the United  States
District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California,  Western
Division  (Westways  World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp.,  et  al.).   The
lawsuit  alleges that requiring travel agencies to pay debit memos  to
American for violations of American's fare rules (by customers of  the
agencies): (1) breaches the Agent Reporting Agreement between American
and  AMR  Eagle and the plaintiffs; (2) constitutes unjust enrichment;
and  (3)  violates the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations
Act  of 1970 (RICO).  The as yet uncertified class includes all travel
agencies  who have been or will be required to pay money  to  American
for  debit memos for fare rules violations from July 26, 1995  to  the
present.   The  plaintiffs seek to enjoin American from enforcing  the
pricing  rules in question and to recover the amounts paid  for  debit
memos,  plus treble damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The  Company
intends  to  vigorously  defend  the lawsuit.   Although  the  Company
believes  that the litigation is without merit, a final adverse  court
decision could impose restrictions on the Company's relationships with
travel agencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  May 13, 1999, the United States (through the Antitrust Division of
the  Department  of Justice) sued AMR Corporation, American  Airlines,
Inc.,  and AMR Eagle Holding Corporation in federal court in  Wichita,
Kansas  (United  States v. AMR Corporation, et  al,  No.  99-1180-JTM,
United  States District Court for the District of Kansas). The lawsuit
alleges   that   American  unlawfully  monopolized  or  attempted   to
monopolize  airline  passenger service to and from  Dallas/Fort  Worth
International Airport (DFW) by increasing service when new competitors
began  flying  to  DFW, and by matching these new competitors'  fares.
The  Department of Justice seeks to enjoin American from  engaging  in
the  alleged improper conduct and to impose restraints on American  to
remedy  the alleged effects of its past conduct.  On April  27,  2001,
the  U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas granted American's
motion for summary judgment.  On June 26, 2001, the U.S. Department of
Justice  appealed  the  granting  of  American's  motion  for  summary
judgment (United States v. AMR Corporation, et al, No. 01-3203, United
States  District  Court  of Appeals for the  Tenth  Circuit),  and  on
September 23, 2002, the parties presented oral arguments to  the  10th
Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not yet issued its decision.   The
Company  intends  to defend the lawsuit vigorously.  A  final  adverse
court  decision  imposing  restrictions on the  Company's  ability  to
respond to competitors would have an adverse impact on the Company.

Between  May  14,  1999 and June 7, 1999, seven class action  lawsuits
were  filed against AMR Corporation, American Airlines, Inc., and  AMR
Eagle  Holding  Corporation in the United  States  District  Court  in
Wichita,  Kansas  seeking  treble  damages  under  federal  and  state
antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees (King
v. AMR Corp., et al.; Smith v. AMR Corp., et al.; Team Electric v. AMR
Corp., et al.; Warren v. AMR Corp., et al.; Whittier v. AMR Corp.,  et
al.; Wright v. AMR Corp., et al.; and Youngdahl v. AMR Corp., et al.).
Collectively,   these   lawsuits  allege  that   American   unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and  from DFW by increasing service when new competitors began  flying
to  DFW,  and by matching these new competitors' fares.   Two  of  the
suits   (Smith  and  Wright)  also  allege  that  American  unlawfully
monopolized  or attempted to monopolize airline passenger  service  to
and from DFW by offering discounted fares to corporate purchasers,  by
offering  a frequent flyer program, by imposing certain conditions  on
the  use  and availability of certain fares, and by offering  override
commissions  to  travel agents. The suits propose to  certify  several
classes  of  consumers,  the broadest of  which  is  all  persons  who
purchased tickets for air travel on American into or out of  DFW  from
1995  to the present.  On November 10, 1999, the District Court stayed
all  of these actions pending developments in the case brought by  the
Department of Justice (see above description).  As a result,  to  date
no  class  has  been certified.  The Company intends to  defend  these
lawsuits  vigorously.   One  or  more final  adverse  court  decisions
imposing   restrictions  on  the  Company's  ability  to  respond   to
competitors  or  awarding  substantial money  damages  would  have  an
adverse impact on the Company.

On  May  17,  2002,  the named plaintiffs in Hall, et  al.  v.  United
Airlines, et al., pending in the United States District Court for  the
Eastern  District  of  North  Carolina,  filed  an  amended  complaint
alleging that between 1995 and the present, American and over 15 other
defendant  airlines conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based
travel agents in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The  court
granted  class action certification to the plaintiff on September  17,
2002,  defining the plaintiff class as all travel agents in the United
States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, who, at any
time   from   October  1,  1997  to  the  present,   issued   tickets,
miscellaneous change orders, or prepaid ticket advices for  travel  on
any  of  the defendant airlines.  The case is stayed as to US  Airways
and  United  Air Lines, since they filed for bankruptcy.  American  is
vigorously defending the lawsuit.  Defendant carriers filed  a  motion
for  summary judgment on December 10, 2002. Trial is set for September
02,  2003.  A final adverse court decision awarding substantial  money
damages  or placing restrictions on the Company's commission  policies
or practices would have an adverse impact on the Company.

On  April  3, 2003, a group of 51 travel agencies opting  out  of  the
certified  class  in Hall, et al. v. United Airlines (see  description
above) filed a complaint styled Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta Air Lines
et. al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of  California  - San Francisco, alleging that between  1997  and  the
present,  American and over 20 other defendant airlines  conspired  to
reduce  commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in  violation  of
Section  1  of the Sherman Act.  American is vigorously defending  the
lawsuit.  A  final  adverse court decision awarding substantial  money
damages might have an adverse impact on the Company.

On April 26, 2002, six travel agencies filed Albany Travel Co., et al.
v.  Orbitz, LLC, et al., in the United States District Court  for  the
Central  District  of California against American, United  Air  Lines,
Delta Air Lines, and Orbitz, LLC, alleging that American and the other
defendants:  (i)  conspired to prevent travel agents  from  acting  as
effective  competitors  in  the distribution  of  airline  tickets  to
passengers  in  violation  of  Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act;  and
(ii)  conspired to monopolize the distribution of common  carrier  air
travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section 2
of the Sherman Act.  The named plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide
class of travel agents, but no class has yet been certified.  American
is  vigorously  defending  the lawsuit.  On  November  25,  2002,  the
District Court stayed this case pending a judgment in Hall et. al.  v.
United  Airlines,  et. al. (see above description).  A  final  adverse
court   decision  awarding  substantial  money  damages   or   placing
restrictions  on the Company's distribution practices  would  have  an
adverse impact on the Company.

On  April  25,  2002, a collection of 38 Quebec travel agencies  filed
Voyages  Montambault  (1989),  Inc.  v.  International  Air  Transport
Association,  et al., seeking a declaratory judgment of  the  Superior
Court  in  Montreal,  Canada  that  American  and  the  other  airline
defendants owe a "fair and reasonable commission" to the agencies, and
that  American  and  the  other  airline defendants  breached  alleged
contracts with these agencies by adopting policies of not paying  base
commissions.   The  defendants  are the  International  Air  Transport
Association,  the  Air  Transport Association, Air  Canada,  American,
America  West,  Delta  Air Lines, Grupo TACA,  Northwest  Airlines/KLM
Airlines,  United  Air  Lines, US Airways, and  Continental  Airlines.
American  is  vigorously defending the lawsuit. A final adverse  court
decision  granting  declaratory relief could  expose  the  Company  to
claims  for  substantial money damages or force  the  Company  to  pay
agency  commissions, either of which would have an adverse  impact  on
the Company.

On May 13, 2002, the named plaintiffs in Always Travel, et. al. v. Air
Canada,  et.  al.,  pending  in the Federal  Court  of  Canada,  Trial
Division,  Montreal, filed a statement of claim alleging that  between
1995 and the present, American, the other defendant airlines, and  the
International   Air   Transport  Association   conspired   to   reduce
commissions  paid  to  Canada-based  travel  agents  in  violation  of
Section  45  of  the Competition Act of Canada.  The named  plaintiffs
seek  to  certify  a  nationwide class of travel agents.   Plaintiffs'
motion  for  certification is set for hearing on  September  2,  2003.
American  is vigorously defending the lawsuit.  A final adverse  court
decision awarding substantial money damages or placing restrictions on
the  Company's commission policies would have an adverse impact on the
Company.

On  August 14, 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed against American
Airlines,  Inc.  in the United States District Court for  the  Central
District  of  California,  Western Division  (All  World  Professional
Travel  Services,  Inc.  v.  American Airlines,  Inc.).   The  lawsuit
alleges  that  requiring  travel  agencies  to  pay  debit  memos  for
refunding  tickets after September 11, 2001:  (1) breaches  the  Agent
Reporting  Agreement between American and plaintiff;  (2)  constitutes
unjust  enrichment;  and  (3) violates the  Racketeer  Influenced  and
Corrupt  Organizations  Act of 1970 (RICO).  The  as  yet  uncertified
class includes all travel agencies who have or will be required to pay
moneys  to  American for an "administrative service charge,"  "penalty
fee," or other fee for processing refunds on behalf of passengers  who
were unable to use their tickets in the days immediately following the
resumption of air carrier service after the tragedies on September 11,
2001.   The  plaintiff  seeks to enjoin American from  collecting  the
debit memos and to recover the amounts paid for the debit memos,  plus
treble  damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.  The Company  intends  to
vigorously defend the lawsuit.  Although the Company believes that the
litigation  is  without merit, a final adverse  court  decision  could
impose   restrictions  on  the  Company's  relationships  with  travel
agencies which could have an adverse impact on the Company.

On   August  19,  2002,  a  U.S.  travel  agency  filed  Power  Travel
International, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.,  in  New  York
state  court against American, Continental Airlines, Delta Air  Lines,
JetBlue  Airways,  United Air Lines, and Northwest Airlines,  alleging
that  American and the other defendants breached their contracts  with
the  agency  as well as the duty of good faith and fair  dealing  when
these carriers at various times reduced base commissions to zero.  The
plaintiff seeks to certify a nationwide class of travel agents, but no
class has yet been certified. The plaintiff dismissed JetBlue from the
lawsuit,  and  the  remaining defendants removed the  lawsuit  to  the
United  States District Court for the Southern District of  New  York.
The  case  is  stayed  as  to United Air Lines,  since  it  filed  for
bankruptcy.  American is vigorously defending the lawsuit.   On  April
17,  2003,  the  court  granted the remaining  defendants'  motion  to
dismiss  the  plaintiff's complaint with leave to  replead  within  20
days.   A  final  adverse  court decision awarding  substantial  money
damages or forcing the Company to pay agency commissions would have an
adverse impact on the Company.

Miami-Dade   County  (the  County)  is  currently  investigating   and
remediating   various   environmental   conditions   at   the    Miami
International Airport (MIA) and funding the remediation costs  through
landing  fees  and various cost recovery methods.  American  Airlines,
Inc.  and AMR Eagle have been named as potentially responsible parties
(PRPs)  for  the contamination at MIA.  During the second  quarter  of
2001,  the  County  filed a lawsuit against 17  defendants,  including
American Airlines, Inc., in an attempt to recover its past and  future
cleanup  costs (Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo  Services,
Inc.,  et  al. in the Florida Circuit Court).  In addition to  the  17
defendants named in the lawsuit, 243 other agencies and companies were
also  named as PRPs and contributors to the contamination.  American's
and  AMR  Eagle's  portion of the cleanup costs cannot  be  reasonably
estimated due to various factors, including the unknown extent of  the
remedial actions that may be required, the proportion of the cost that
will  ultimately  be  recovered  from  the  responsible  parties,  and
uncertainties   regarding  the  environmental   agencies   that   will
ultimately  supervise the remedial activities and the nature  of  that
supervision.  The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit.

Norman, OK 73019

Dear David:

          As  you will recall at the meeting on April 24, it  was
decided  that  all  Directors would  take  their  fees  in  stock
equivalent units.  Accordingly, provided you agree, the  deferral
will occur as follows:

          1.     All   director's  fees  and  retainers  ("Fees")
payable  to you in connection with your service on the boards  of
directors   (including  committees  of  such   boards)   of   AMR
Corporation  and American Airlines, Inc. for the  period  May  1,
2003 through December 31, 2003 , will be deferred and paid to you
in accordance with this letter agreement.

          2.    Fees will be converted to Stock Equivalent  Units
in accordance with the Directors' Stock Equivalent Purchase Plan,
a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan").

          3.   Within 30 days of the date when you cease to be  a
Director  of AMR Corporation, the Stock Equivalent Units  accrued
pursuant to the Plan will be converted to cash and paid to you by
multiplying  the  number of such Stock Equivalent  Units  by  the
arithmetic  mean of the high and the low of AMR stock during  the
month when you ceased to be a Director of AMR Corporation.

          4.    AMR's obligation to make the payment pursuant  to
paragraph 3 hereof will not be released or modified by reason  of
your  death.   In  such event, the cash payment  contemplated  by
paragraph  3  will  be made to your named beneficiary  under  the
Director's   Term  Life  Insurance  Policy  maintained   by   the
Corporation.










          If   the  foregoing  is  satisfactory  to  you,  please
indicate  by signing one of the originals (two are enclosed)  and
returning it to me.
