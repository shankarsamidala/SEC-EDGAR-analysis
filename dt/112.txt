appropriate)
         [X](a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part
           III of this form could not be eliminated without
           unreasonable effort or expense;
         [X](b) The subject annual report, semi-annual report,

           applicable.

PART III - NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Forms 10-K, 20-F,
11-K, 10-Q, N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof,
could not be filed within the prescribed time period.
                  (Attach Extra Sheets if Needed)

The Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2002, could not be filed at this time without
unreasonable effort and expense.  The Registrant is in the process
of negotiating and implementing a crucial cost reduction program.
That program includes ongoing, intensive discussions with its three
major labor unions, aircraft creditors and significant vendors
concerning the major concessions that are necessary in light of the
Registrant's weakened financial condition.  The Registrant needs to
implement this program quickly to survive because its financial
results are not sustainable.  The Registrant believes it will soon
conclude these discussions and be in a position to file its Form 10-K.

PART IV - OTHER INFORMATION

  The past two years have had a large impact on the Registrant's
  finances.  The Registrant incurred an aggregate operating loss
  of $3.3 billion in 2002, up from the operating loss of $2.5 billion
  for 2001. These losses reflect, among other things, the substantial
  decrease in the Registrant's revenues which began in early 2001
  and accelerated after the September 11 terrorist attacks.  On
  reduced capacity since the events of September 11, 2001, the
  Registrant's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
  down 8.8 percent, with the Registrant's primary subsidiary's
  revenue per available seat mile down 7.2 percent on a capacity
  decrease of 1.4 percent, compared to the year ended December 31,
  2001.
