</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Nature of Operations</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and internationally
in Mexico. We operate in five sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: directional
drilling services; rental tools; casing and tubing services; compressed air drilling services; and
production services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service. The price we charge for our services depends upon several
factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive
environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based
on price, quality of service and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel.
The principal operating costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance
of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Basis of Presentation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year&#146;s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;154, <I>Accounting Changes and Error Corrections</I>. SFAS No.&nbsp;154
requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements unless it is impracticable. SFAS No.&nbsp;154 also requires that a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS
No.&nbsp;154 replaces APB Opinion No.&nbsp;20, <I>Accounting Changes </I>and SFAS No.&nbsp;3, <I>Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements</I>. SFAS No.&nbsp;154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December&nbsp;15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;154 as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 and the
adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In November&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;151, <I>Inventory Costs </I>&#150; an Amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;43,
Chapter&nbsp;4, which amends the guidance in ARB No.&nbsp;43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No.&nbsp;151 requires that
these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No.&nbsp;151 requires the
allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 151, on a prospective basis, as of
January&nbsp;1, 2006 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>. SFAS No.&nbsp;123R revises
SFAS No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>, and focuses on accounting for share-based
payments for services by employer to employee. This statement requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their grant-date fair values. See Note 3 for a more detailed description of our adoption
of SFAS No.&nbsp;123R.

Inc., or Specialty, for $83.6&nbsp;million in cash. The results of Specialty&#146;s operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements since that date. Specialty, located in
Lafayette, Louisiana, is engaged in the rental of high quality drill pipe, heavy weight spiral
drill pipe, tubing work strings, blow-out preventors, choke manifolds and various valves and
handling tools for oil and natural gas drilling. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, Specialty
had revenues of $29.6&nbsp;million. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase
price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 3 &#150; STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No.&nbsp;123. We adopted SFAS
No.&nbsp;123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first quarter of 2006 based on our historical experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based compensation using Accounting Principle
Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25. Under APB No.&nbsp;25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with
an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. For stock
options with exercise prices at or above the market value of the stock on the grant date, we
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation</I>.
We also adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 for the stock options granted to our
employees and directors. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under APB No.&nbsp;25.

earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had
been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those
that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares
outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. In addition, we
understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic
shares outstanding for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. Consequently, we have restated our
financial statements for each of those periods. The incorrect calculation resulted from a
mathematical error and an improper application of SFAS No.&nbsp;128. The effect of the restatement is
to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for each period and to reduce weighted
average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. Consequently, weighted
average diluted earnings per share were increased for each period and weighted average basic
earnings per share was increased for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004.

capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of

month repayment schedule with the remaining balance due at maturity. Additionally, during the
second year, we were to be required to prepay the remaining balance of the term loans by 75% of
excess cash flow, if any, after debt service and capital expenditures. The interest rate payable
on borrowings was based on a margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate, referred to as LIBOR,
or the prime rate, and there was a 0.5% fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving line of credit.
The margin over LIBOR was to increase by 1.0% in the second year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% equity interest in AirComp and the subordinated note
in the principal amount of $4.8&nbsp;million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I $7.1&nbsp;million in
cash and issued a new $4.0&nbsp;million subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. The
subordinated note issued to M-I requires quarterly interest payments and the principal amount is
due October&nbsp;9, 2007. Contingent upon a future equity offering, the subordinated note is
convertible into up to 700,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the market
value of the common stock at the time of conversion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services Inc., or Tubular, had a subordinated note
outstanding and payable to Jens Mortensen, the seller of Tubular and one of our directors, in the
amount of $4.0&nbsp;million with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%. Interest was payable quarterly and the
final maturity of the note was January&nbsp;31, 2006. The subordinated note was subordinated to the
rights of our bank lenders. The balance of this subordinated note was repaid in full in January
2006 with proceeds from our senior notes offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2&nbsp;million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5&nbsp;million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March&nbsp;2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0&nbsp;million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June&nbsp;1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June&nbsp;1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At March&nbsp;31, 2006 and December&nbsp;31, 2005 the outstanding amounts due were $500,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the purchase of Delta, we issued to the sellers a note in the amount of
$350,000. The note bears interest at 2% and the principal and accrued interest was repaid on its
maturity of April&nbsp;1, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the purchase of Tubular, we agreed to pay a total of $1.2&nbsp;million to Mr.
Mortensen in exchange for a non-compete agreement. Monthly payments of $20,576 are due under this
agreement through January&nbsp;31, 2007. In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products,
Inc., or Safco,, we also agreed to pay a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a
non-compete agreement. We are required to make annual payments of $50,000 through September&nbsp;30,
2007. In connection with the purchase of Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two
management employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual
payments of $110,000 through May&nbsp;2008. Total amounts due under non-compete agreements at March&nbsp;31,
2006 and December&nbsp;31, 2005 were $615,000 and $698,000, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March&nbsp;31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5.0%. At March&nbsp;31, 2006 and
December&nbsp;31, 2005, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $96,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also had a real estate loan which was payable in equal monthly installments of $4,344 with the
remaining outstanding balance due on January&nbsp;1, 2010. The loan has a floating interest rate based
on prime plus 2.0%. The outstanding principal balance was $548,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2005. The

offering.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to our activities prior to our
bankruptcy in 1988. However, we believe that we were discharged from liability for all such claims
in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a material loss relating to any such legal
proceeding is remote.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2004, Mountain Air was a defendant in an action brought in April&nbsp;2004 in the
District Court of Mesa County, Colorado, by the former owner of Mountain Air Drilling Service
Company, Inc., from whom Mountain Air acquired assets in 2001. The plaintiff sought to accelerate
payment of the note issued in connection with the acquisition and sought $1.9&nbsp;million in damages
(representing principal and interest due under the note), on the basis that Mountain Air failed to
provide financial statements required by the note. We raised several defenses to the plaintiff&#146;s
claim. In March&nbsp;2005, we reached an agreement with the plaintiff to settle the action and paid to
the plaintiff $1.0&nbsp;million on April&nbsp;1, 2005 and agreed to pay an additional $350,000 on June&nbsp;1,
2006, and $150,000 on June&nbsp;1, 2007, in settlement of all amounts due under the promissory note and
all other claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The
legal proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On April&nbsp;4, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, based
in Lafayette, Louisiana, for a total consideration of approximately $13.7&nbsp;million, which includes
$11.3&nbsp;million in cash, $1.6&nbsp;million in our common stock and a $750,000 three-year promissory note.
In addition, we purchased all the patents and proprietary technology that Tommie L. Rogers, Rogers&#146;
founder and Chief Executive Officer, developed at Rogers. Rogers provides service for tubing tongs
and casing tongs and by renting and selling specialized automated power tongs to the snubbing and
well control markets. Rogers also rents and sells drill pipe tongs, accessories, hydraulic power
units and hydraulic tong positioners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of all of the
outstanding capital stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics &#038; Services Corporation. We anticipate that
the purchase price will consist of $102.3&nbsp;million in cash and 2.5&nbsp;million shares of our common
stock. The stock purchase agreement provides that if we are unable to obtain the necessary
financing by August&nbsp;15, 2006, we must pay to the sellers a cash
break-up fee equal to $1.0&nbsp;million. DLS currently operates a fleet of 51 rigs, including 20
drilling rigs, 18 workover rigs and 12 pulling rigs in Argentina and
one drilling rig in Bolivia.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May of 2006, we filed a registration statement for an offering of common stock in the amount of
$80.0&nbsp;million to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of DLS.

but not limited to, those discussed above.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview of Our Business</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and internationally
in Mexico. We currently operate in five sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry:
directional drilling services; rental tools; casing and tubing services; compressed air drilling
services; and production services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service. The price we charge for our services depends upon several
factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive
environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based
on price, quality of service and equipment, and general reputation and experience of our personnel.
The demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital
expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which can fluctuate based
upon the prices of oil and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the &#147;rig count,&#148; is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the U.S.
increased from 862 as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 to 1,608 on April&nbsp;30, 2006 according to the Baker Hughes
rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of December
31, 2002 to 656 on April&nbsp;30, 2006, which accounted for 32.8% and 40.8% of the total U.S. rig count,
respectively. Currently, we believe that the number of available drillings rigs is insufficient to
meet the demand for drilling rigs. Consequently, unless a significant number of additional
drilling rigs are brought online, the rig count may not increase substantially despite the strong
demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Restatement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares
outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. In addition, we
understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic
shares outstanding for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. Consequently, we have restated our
financial statements for each of those periods. The incorrect calculation resulted from a
mathematical error and an improper application of SFAS No.&nbsp;128. The effect of the restatement is
to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for each period and to reduce weighted
average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. Therefore, diluted
earnings per share were increased for each period and basic earnings per share were increased for
the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. Based on the proper allocation of SFAS No.&nbsp;128, for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005, weighted average diluted shares outstanding was 14,695,000,
compared to the previously reported weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 17,789,000 for
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. The effect is to increase diluted earnings per share to
$0.11 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005 compared to the $0.09 previously reported for the
period (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Comparison of Three Months Ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 were $47.0&nbsp;million, an increase of 143.2%
compared to $19.3&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments due to acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2005 and
the first quarter of 2006, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales
personnel, the opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional equipment.
Revenues increased most significantly at our rental tools segment due to the acquisition of
Specialty Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, effective January&nbsp;1, 2006 and Delta Rental Services
Inc., or Delta, on April&nbsp;1, 2005, and at the compressed air drilling segment due to the acquisition
of the air drilling assets of W.T. Enterprises, Inc., or WT, on July&nbsp;11, 2005, and improved pricing
for our services in West Texas. Our directional drilling services segment revenues increased in
the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling
services, the acquisition of Target Energy, Inc., or Target, which provides
measurement-while-drilling tools, or MWD, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the
opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional down-hole motors which increased
our capacity and market presence.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues also increased at our casing and tubing services segment due the acquisition of the casing
and tubing assets of Patterson Services, Inc on September&nbsp;1, 2005, along with improved market
conditions and increased market penetration for our services in South Texas, East Texas, Louisiana
and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also contributing to increased revenues was the acquisition of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, as of May&nbsp;1, 2005 in our production services segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our gross profit for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 increased 195.8% to $16.7&nbsp;million, or 35.4%
of revenues, compared to $5.6&nbsp;million, or 29.1%, of revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,
2005. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is due to the acquisition of
Specialty as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 and the acquisition of Delta as of April&nbsp;1, 2005, in the high
margin rental tool business. The increase in gross profit is also due to increased revenues at our
compressed air drilling services segment, including the acquisition of the air drilling assets of
WT, increased revenues and improved pricing in the directional drilling services segment, improved
market conditions for our domestic casing and tubing segment and the acquisition of additional
casing and tubing assets in September&nbsp;2005. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by
an increase in depreciation expense of 264.3% to $3.3&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2006
compared to $0.9&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2005. The increase is due to additional
depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues
consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of
our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross
profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">General and administrative expense was $6.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006 period compared to
$3.0&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2005. General and administrative expense increased due to
the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our
internal control processes, costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance efforts and increased
corporate accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and
administrative expenses were 13.8% in the 2006 quarter and 15.5% in the 2005 quarter.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment, </I>effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. With the adoption of SFAS no.
123R, we recorded $0.9&nbsp;million of expense related to stock options during the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2006. We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R using the modified prospective transition method,
utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our
employee stock options. Under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related
to unvested stock awards as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair
value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in
historical reported earnings. Therefore, we recorded an expense of $0.9&nbsp;million related to stock
options for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, we accounted for our
stock-based compensation using Accounting Principle Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25. Under APB No.&nbsp;25,
compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the
market price on the grant date of the option. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized
under APB No.&nbsp;25.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amortization expense was $607,000 in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $394,000 in the first
quarter of 2005. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible
assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income from operations for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 totaled $8.6&nbsp;million, a 284.2%
increase over income from operations of $2.2&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and
administrative expenses, stock option expense and amortization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our net interest expense was $3.6&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $521,000 for
the first quarter of 2005. Interest expense increased in the 2006 quarter due to the increased
borrowings at a higher average interest rate. In January of 2006 we issued $160.0&nbsp;million of senior notes
bearing interest at 9.0% to fund the acquisition of Specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and
for working capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the first quarter of 2006 was $0 compared to
$144,000 for the first quarter of 2005 due to the acquisition of the minority interest in AirComp
L.L.C., or AirComp, as of July&nbsp;11, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had net income of $4.4&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 182.3%, compared to
net income of $1.6&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 for our directional drilling services segment were
$15.1&nbsp;million, an increase of 52.0% from the $9.9&nbsp;million in revenues for the quarter ended March
31, 2005. Income from operations increased 38.7% to $2.6&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2006
from $1.9&nbsp;million for the comparable 2005 period. The improved results for this segment are due to
the increase in drilling activity in the Texas and Gulf Coast areas, improved pricing for
directional and horizontal drilling services, the acquisition of Target as of August&nbsp;1, 2005, the
establishment of new operations in West Texas and Oklahoma, and the addition of operations and
sales personnel which increased our capacity and market presence. Our increased operating expenses
as a result of the addition of operations and personnel were more than offset by the growth in
revenues and improved pricing for our services.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Rental Tools Segment</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 for the rental tools segment were $10.4&nbsp;million, from
$373,000 in revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. Income from operations increased to
$5.0&nbsp;million in the 2006 period compared to loss from operations of $80,000 in the 2005 period.
Our rental tools revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared to
the prior year due primarily due to the acquisitions of Specialty and Delta. The acquisition of
Specialty increased the rental tool revenue by $8.9&nbsp;million for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006.
Delta was acquired as of April&nbsp;1, 2005, and Specialty was acquired as of January&nbsp;1, 2006, the
effective date of their respective acquisitions. Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, Delta
and Specialty were merged in February&nbsp;2006 to form Allis-Chalmers Rental Tools, Inc

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 for the casing and tubing services segment were $9.5
million, an increase of 165.7% from the $3.6&nbsp;million in revenues for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31,
2005. Revenues from domestic operations increased to $8.0&nbsp;million in the 2006 period from $1.9
million in the 2005 period as a result of the acquisition of the casing and tubing assets of
Patterson Services on September&nbsp;1, 2005, which resulted in increased market penetration for our
services in South Texas, East Texas, Louisiana and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Revenues from Mexico
operations decreased to $1.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006 from $1.7&nbsp;million in the 2005
period. Income from operations increased 39.5% to $1.9&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2006 from
$1.3&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in this segment&#146;s operating income is due
to our increased revenues from domestic operations. The operating income as a percentage of
revenue decreased to 19.6% for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to 37.3% for the same
period of 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues is due to the
increase in domestic revenues as compared to Mexico revenues, which have higher operating income
margins.

an increase of 117.6% compared to $4.2&nbsp;million in revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,
2005. Income from operations increased to $2.2&nbsp;million in the 2006 period compared to income from
operations of $527,000 in the 2005 period. Our compressed air drilling revenues and operating
income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared to the prior year due primarily due to the
acquisition of the air drilling assets of WT as of July&nbsp;11, 2005, improved pricing for our services
and our investment in additional equipment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Operations for this segment consist of Downhole Injection Services, LLC, or Downhole which was
acquired December&nbsp;1, 2004, and Capcoil which was acquired May&nbsp;1, 2005. Downhole and Capcoil were
merged in February&nbsp;2006, to form Allis-Chalmers Production Services, Inc. Revenues were $3.0
million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, an increase of 127.1% compared to $1.3&nbsp;million
in revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. Income from operations increased to
$277,000 in the 2006 period compared to loss from operations of $39,000 in the 2005 period. Our
production services revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared

31, 2006 compared to $1.4&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005. The increase was due
to stock option expense of $0.9&nbsp;million recorded in 2006 with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the
increase in accounting and administrative staff to support the growing organization, increased
franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares and cost related to our Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance effort.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt, to complete
acquisitions and acquire and maintain equipment, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our
primary sources of liquidity are borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, proceeds from the
issuance of debt and equity securities and cash flows from operations. We had cash and cash
equivalents of $10.7&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to $1.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Operating Activities</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, our operating activities used $5.6&nbsp;million in cash
compared to a use of $822,000 for the same period in 2005. Net income for the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2006 increased to $4.4&nbsp;million, compared to $1.6&nbsp;million in the 2005 period. The $4.4
million in net income for the 2006 period includes a charge of $0.9&nbsp;million related to the
expensing of stock options as required under SFAS No.&nbsp;123R. Revenues and income from operations
increased in the first three months of 2006 due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of
2006 and the second and third quarters of 2005, the investment in additional equipment, the opening
of new operations offices and the addition of operations and sales personnel. Non-cash expenses
totaled $4.9&nbsp;million during the first three months of 2006 consisting of $3.9&nbsp;million of
depreciation and amortization, $0.9&nbsp;million from the expensing of stock options, $355,000 of
imputed interest related to the effective date of the Specialty acquisition, $180,000 related to
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables, offset by $514,000 on the gain from
asset retirements. Non-cash expenses during the first three months of 2005 totaled $1.5&nbsp;million,
consisting of depreciation and amortization expense of $1.3&nbsp;million and minority interest of
$144,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$14.9&nbsp;million in cash, principally due to an increase of $4.3&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.5&nbsp;million in inventory, a decrease of $1.3&nbsp;million in accounts payable, and a
decrease of $11.0&nbsp;million in an accrued expense, offset in part by an increase of $2.8&nbsp;million in
accrued interest. Accounts receivable increased due to the increase in our revenues in the first
three months of 2006. Other inventory increased primarily due to increased activity levels. The
decrease in accrued expenses can be attributed to accrued bonuses of Specialty that we paid in
connection with the acquisition. The increase in accrued interest relates to our 9.0% senior
notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $3.8
million in cash, principally due to an increase of $3.4&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, an increase
of $515,000 in inventory and other assets, and a decrease of $92,000 in accrued expenses, offset in
part by an increase in accrued salaries, benefits and payroll taxes of $185,000. Accounts
receivable increased by $3.4&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2005 due to the increase in our revenues in the
first quarter of 2005. Other assets increased due primarily to an increase in prepaid insurance
related to insurance premium deposits required for our policies that went into affect April&nbsp;1,
2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, we used $89.8&nbsp;million in investing activities,
consisting of $83.4&nbsp;million for the acquisition of Specialty, net of cash received and $7.6&nbsp;million
for capital expenditures, offset by $1.2&nbsp;million of proceeds from equipment sales. Included in the
$7.6&nbsp;million for capital expenditures was $2.6&nbsp;million for the expansion of our MWD equipment used
in the directional drilling segment and $2.2&nbsp;million for additional equipment in our compressed air
drilling services segment. A majority of our equipment sales relate to items &#147;lost in hole&#148; by our
customers. During the first three months of 2005, we used $2.7&nbsp;million in investing activities,
consisting principally of the purchase of equipment of $1.6&nbsp;million for casing equipment,
approximately $263,000 for the purchase of downhole motors and approximately $779,000 for new
compressed air drilling equipment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, financing activities provided $104.1&nbsp;million in cash.
We received $161.4&nbsp;million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $43.5&nbsp;million in borrowings
under long-term debt facilities, repaid $3.0&nbsp;million in related party debt, repaid $6.4&nbsp;million

offering of $160.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. The notes are due
January&nbsp;15, 2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to
fund the Specialty acquisition, to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes. During
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2005, financing activities provided a net of $2.2&nbsp;million in cash.
We received $2.4&nbsp;million, net, in borrowings under long-term debt facilities and paid $178,000 in

under the term loans as of July&nbsp;2006 were to be repaid in monthly principal payments based on a 48
month repayment schedule with the remaining balance due at maturity. Additionally, during the
second year, we were to be required to prepay the remaining balance of the term loans by 75% of
excess cash flow, if any, after debt service and capital expenditures. The interest rate payable
on borrowings was based on a margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate, referred to as LIBOR,

The margin over LIBOR was to increase by 1.0% in the second year.

restated credit agreement which provides for a $25.0&nbsp;million revolving line of credit with a
maturity of January&nbsp;2010. Our January&nbsp;2006 amended and restated credit agreement contains
customary events of default and financial covenants and limits our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions, create liens

cash and issued a new $4.0&nbsp;million subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. The
subordinated note issued to M-I requires quarterly interest payments and the principal amount is
due October&nbsp;9, 2007. Contingent upon a future equity offering, the subordinated note is

legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March&nbsp;2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0&nbsp;million in cash, and agreed to pay an

sufficient funds for our identified projects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal
growth and acquisitions. We are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential
acquisition candidates. The acquisition of assets could require additional financing, which we
currently anticipate would be borrowed under our bank facility. Any such borrowing would require
the consent of our lenders under our bank credit facilities. We also expect to make capital
expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. Our performance and cash flow from
operations will be determined by the demand for our services which in turn are affected by our
customers&#146; expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development, and industry perceptions and
expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where we operate. We will need to
refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide funds for capital
expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we will require additional equity or
debt financing and the proceeds of the pending offering. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will
be acceptable to us.

In addition, we purchased all the patents and proprietary technology that Tommie L. Rogers, Rogers&#146;
founder and Chief Executive Officer, developed at Rogers. Rogers provides service for tubing tongs
and casing tongs and by renting and selling specialized automated power tongs to the snubbing and

other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No
material changes to such information have occurred during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;154, <I>Accounting Changes and Error Corrections</I>. SFAS No.&nbsp;154
requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements unless it is impracticable. SFAS No.&nbsp;154 also requires that a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS
No.&nbsp;154 replaces APB Opinion No.&nbsp;20, <I>Accounting Changes </I>and SFAS No.&nbsp;3, <I>Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statement&#146;</I>. SFAS No.&nbsp;154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December&nbsp;15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;154 as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 and the
adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, <I>Share-Based Payment. </I>SFAS No.&nbsp;123R revises SFAS
No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>, and focuses on accounting for share-based
payments for services by employer to employee. The statement requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their fair values. We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;123R as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 and used the modified
prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the calculation
of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the modified prospective method, stock
option awards that are granted, modified or settled after January&nbsp;1, 2006 will be measured and
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;123R. Compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but
not vested, as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to
value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No.&nbsp;123. See Note 3 of our unaudited
consolidated condensed financial statements for a more detailed description of our adoption of SFAS
No.&nbsp;123R.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In November&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;151, <I>Inventory Costs </I>&#150; an Amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;43,
Chapter&nbsp;4, which amends the guidance in ARB No.&nbsp;43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No.&nbsp;151 requires that
these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No.&nbsp;151 requires the
allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;151, on a prospective basis, as of
January&nbsp;1, 2006 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately $49.0&nbsp;million

three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006, we repaid all variable interest rate debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value

required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our

the Evaluation Date.

report and under the caption &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations &#151; Restatement,&#148; we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect
calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first
three quarters of 2004, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended
March&nbsp;31, 2005. In addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect
calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
2004. Consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. The
incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share</I>. Management has concluded
that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient
experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the
financial reporting process.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As part of our growth strategy over the past five years, we have completed acquisitions of several
privately-held businesses, including closely-held entities. Prior to becoming part of our

implement or maintain, the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial
reporting that federal law requires of publicly-held companies such as ours. We are in the process
of creating and implementing appropriate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls
over financial reporting at each of our recently acquired businesses. However, we have not yet

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Each Seller is acquiring its portion of the Stock Consideration for its own account,
without a view to the distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. No Seller has any
contract, undertaking, agreement, understanding or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or
pledge to any Person any part or all of the Stock Consideration which such Seller is acquiring, or
any interest therein, nor has any present plans to enter into the same. Each Seller agrees that it
will not transfer any of the Stock Consideration except in compliance with applicable United States
and other applicable securities laws.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each Seller is an &#147;accredited investor&#148; within the meaning of Regulation&nbsp;D under the
Securities Act and was not organized solely for the purpose of acquiring any of the Stock
Consideration. Each Seller has adequate means of providing for its current needs and
contingencies, has no need now, and anticipates no need in the foreseeable future, to sell its
portion of the Stock Consideration, and currently has sufficient net worth and financial liquidity
to afford a complete loss of its investment in the Buyer. Each Seller has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so that such Seller is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Buyer and has made such evaluation. Each Seller fully
understands that the Stock Consideration is a speculative investment which involves a high degree
of risk of loss of such Seller&#146;s entire investment. No person or entity, other than the Buyer or
its authorized representatives, has offered the Stock Consideration to any Seller. Each Seller is
able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Stock Consideration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Each Seller understands that the Buyer has not registered the Stock Consideration under
the Securities Act, and each Seller agrees that the Stock Consideration may not be sold or
transferred or offered for sale or transfer by it without registration under the Securities Act or
the availability of an exemption therefrom. Each Seller has had an opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from the management and authorized representatives of the Buyer, and to review
any other relevant documents and records concerning the business of the Buyer, including all of the
Buyer Reports (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;5.7</U>), and the terms and conditions of this investment,
and that any such questions have been answered to such Seller&#146;s full satisfaction. Each Seller
understands that no Governmental Authority has passed upon or made any recommendation or
endorsement of an investment in the Stock Consideration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;4.27 <U>Customers</U>. Since March&nbsp;31, 2006, none of the customers set forth on
<U>Schedule&nbsp;4.27</U> has cancelled or otherwise modified its relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary and no such Person has advised Sellers of any intention to do so and, to the knowledge
of any Seller, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not adversely affect
any of such relationships if the Company continues to conduct the Business in a manner consistent
with past practices.

pursuant to (ii)&nbsp;and (iii)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;10, such communications shall be deemed to have been

attached hereto), whether in writing or by telecopier, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on
Schedule&nbsp;2 hereto (&#147;Schedule&nbsp;2&#148;), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be the person or persons so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall be
executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such authorized signatories is set forth on Schedule
2. The undersigned is authorized to certify that the signatories on Schedule&nbsp;2 are authorized
signatories. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing
actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact
any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule&nbsp;2, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of

confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiary&#146;s
bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers
provided by the Buyer or the Seller to identify (i)&nbsp;the beneficiary, (ii)&nbsp;the beneficiary&#146;s bank,
or (iii)&nbsp;an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment
order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other
than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary&#146;s
bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that
these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;<U>Miscellaneous</U>. The provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived, altered,
amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by all of the parties
hereto. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole
or in part by any party, except as provided in Section&nbsp;6, without the prior consent of the other
parties. This Escrow Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
New York. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum
non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in
any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the State of New York. The parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Escrow Agreement. No
party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable
to perform its obligations under the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire,
floods, strikes, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Receipt of the Escrow Shares (or substituted letter of credit or insurance policy)
shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by account statement, and any
discrepancies in any such account statement shall be noted by Sellers to Escrow Agent within 30
calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure to inform Escrow Agent in writing of any
discrepancies in any such account statement within said 30-day period shall conclusively be deemed
confirmation of such account statement in its entirety. In the event of any discrepancy or
inconsistency between the provisions of this Escrow Agreement and the provisions of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the provisions hereof shall prevail and be deemed to reflect the intent and
understanding of the parties hereto.
