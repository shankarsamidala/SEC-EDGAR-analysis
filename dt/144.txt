                    SAVINGS PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF
             BETHLEHEM STEEL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
             ----------------------------------------------------

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         -----------------------------


A.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

The Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of Bethlehem Steel Corporation and
Subsidiary Companies (the "Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors of
Bethlehem Steel Corporation ("Bethlehem") effective as of March 1, 1975.  The
Plan has a trust (the "Trust") under a Trust Agreement with State Street Bank
and Trust Company ("State Street").  State Street is also the Plan's investment
manager.  The Employee Benefits Administration Committee, consisting of five or
more officers and employees of Bethlehem, is the administrator of the Plan.
Administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by Bethlehem.

The Plan is a defined contribution plan and is subject to the provisions of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Under the terms of
the Plan, an eligible salaried employee may elect to have up to a maximum of
21% of eligible salary contributed as Before-Tax Contributions and up to a
maximum of from 10% to 14% of eligible salary as After-Tax Contributions
through payroll deductions, depending upon the length of continuous service and
the amount elected as Before-Tax Contributions.  Before-Tax and After-Tax
Contributions are subject to a combined limit of 21% of eligible salary.

Before-Tax and After-Tax Contributions are treated as either Basic or
Supplemental Contributions depending on the participant's length of continuous
service and the amount elected as Before-Tax Contributions.  Basic
Contributions, which may range from 1% to a maximum of 4% of eligible salary,
are matched 100% by the Employing Company.  After-Tax Supplemental
Contributions are limited to 10% of eligible salary.  Participants should refer
to the Plan document for a complete description of the Plan provisions.

B.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Accounting
- -------------------

The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.

Investment Valuation and Income Recognition
- -------------------------------------------

Investments in Bethlehem Common Stock and equity and fixed income securities
are valued at fair value based upon the last published quotations for the last
business day of the year.  Mutual fund and common/collective trust investments
are valued at net asset value representing the value at which shares of the
fund may be purchased or redeemed.  Investments in contracts with insurance

                                     - 3 -








<PAGE> 4

companies are presented at contract value, representing contributions made
under the contracts, plus interest at the contract rate, less funds withdrawn
(see Note C).  Loans to participants are valued at cost which approximates fair
value.

Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.  Interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis.  Dividends are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

The Plan presents in the statement of changes in net assets available for
benefits the net appreciation (depreciation) in the fair value of its
investments which consists of the realized gains and losses and the unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on those investments.

Withdrawals and Distributions
- -----------------------------

Withdrawals and distributions to participants are recorded when paid.

Participant Accounts
- --------------------

Each participant's account is credited with the participant's contribution and
allocations of (a) the Company's contribution and (b) Plan earnings.
Allocations are based on participant earnings or account balance, as defined.
The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be
provided from the participant's vested account.

Accounting Estimates
- --------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and contingency
disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
additions and deductions during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

C.  CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENT OPTIONS

Contributions are paid by Bethlehem to the Trustee the week after they were
earned.  Before-Tax and After-Tax Employee Contributions are allocated among
the State Street Stable Fixed Income Fund, State Street S&P 500 Flagship Fund,
Fidelity Puritan Fund, Fidelity Magellan Fund and Bethlehem Stock Fund in
multiples of 1% at each participant's election.  Matching Company Contributions
are required to be initially invested in the Bethlehem Stock Fund.  After a
period of two full calendar years, these Matching Company Contributions can be
transferred to any of the other available investment funds.

The State Street Stable Fixed Income Fund (the "Fixed Income Fund") is a fixed
income fund consisting of investments in fully benefit responsive guaranteed
annuity contracts ("GAC") and one immediate participation guarantee contract.
The contracts are credited with interest at the rates specified in the
applicable contracts, which range from 4.36% to 25.00% and 5.52% to

                                     - 4 -






<PAGE> 5

14.40% for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The Fixed
Income Fund had an average yield of 6.47% for 1999 and 6.77% for 1998.  The
Fixed Income Fund had thirteen contracts at December 31, 1999 and seven
contracts at December 31, 1998, representing 37.3% and 18.2% of the fund's net
assets, respectively, that had interest rate reset provisions.  These contracts
were credited with interest rates ranging from 4.36% to 25.00% and from 5.90%
to 14.40% for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Interest earned on investments in the Fixed Income Fund is reinvested in that
fund.  Within the Fixed Income Fund there were no individual investments at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 representing 5% or more of the Plan's net assets.
As discussed in Note B, the contracts are included in the financial statements
at contract value, which approximates fair value, due to their fully benefit
responsive nature.

The State Street S&P 500 Flagship Fund is a diversified equity investment fund;
the Fidelity Puritan Fund is a growth and income mutual fund; and the Fidelity
Magellan Fund is an equity growth mutual fund.  Earnings on investments are
reinvested in the fund in which they are earned.

Contributions to the Bethlehem Stock Fund are used to purchase shares of
Bethlehem Common Stock.  There were no dividends on Bethlehem Common Stock for
1999 and 1998.  The Plan provides that shares of Bethlehem Common Stock may be
purchased by the Trustee on the open market or directly from Bethlehem.  The
Plan also permits, in lieu of cash contributions to the Trustee for the
purchase of shares of Bethlehem Common Stock, the transfer by Bethlehem of the
necessary number of shares of Bethlehem Common Stock directly to the Trustee.
During 1999 and 1998, Matching Company Contributions were made in shares of
Bethlehem Common Stock and all other contributions were made in cash.

The Self-Managed Account ("SMA") gives participants access to a wide range of
investments that include equity and fixed income securities and mutual funds
through State Street Brokerage Services, Inc.  Assets must be transferred from
any or all of the other investment funds into the SMA with an initial transfer
of at least $2,500 and a $500 minimum transfer thereafter.  The SMA balance
cannot exceed 50% of the participant's total account balance.  Assets invested
in the Fixed Income Fund must be transferred to any or all of the other core
funds where they must remain for 90 days before transfer to the SMA.

D.  PARTICIPANT LOANS

The Plan has a loan provision to permit an eligible participant to borrow up to
50% of his vested account balance, subject to a minimum loan of $1,000 and a
maximum loan of $50,000.  Any participant with an account balance of $2,000 or
more is eligible for a loan.  A participant is permitted to have up to two
loans outstanding at one time.

Participants may not borrow from the Bethlehem Stock Fund or the SMA.  The term
of the loan is generally 12 to 57 months but may be for a term of up to 177
months under certain conditions.  Interest is fixed over the repayment period
at the prime rate as quoted by the Wall Street Journal on the last business day
of the month prior to the month in which the loan application is approved,

                                     - 5 -








<PAGE> 6

plus 1%.  Repayments of principal plus interest are made to the Loan Fund and
transferred to the other investment funds in accordance with participants'
current contribution investment elections.

E.  WITHDRAWALS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Withdrawals from the funds may be made from time to time in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan.  However, voluntary withdrawal of the Before-Tax or
After-Tax Basic Contributions before the related Matching Company Contributions
have vested may result in forfeiture of the Matching Company Contributions and
earnings thereon.  The forfeitures reduce future Matching Company
Contributions.  For a participant employed on or before December 31, 1988,
Matching Company Contributions for 1989 and later years vest immediately.  For
a participant employed on or after January 1, 1989, Matching Company
Contributions will vest 100% after the participant completes five years of
service.  Withdrawals of Matching Company Contributions from the Bethlehem
Stock Fund may not be made until after the end of the second calendar year
following the year of contribution.

Upon the termination of a participant's employment, the participant, or in the
event of a participant's death, his beneficiary, will receive the investment
funds allocated to his account.  In lieu of receiving a lump-sum distribution,
a participant or his beneficiary may elect to defer payment to a later year or
receive installment payments.

At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Plan had a $74,601 and $462,590 obligation
for withdrawals and distributions processed and approved, but not yet paid to
participants.  This obligation is reported as a liability for Department of
Labor Form 5500 reporting purposes, but not for purposes of these financial
statements.

F.  FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS

Plan's net assets (dollars in millions):

become participant-directed investments and can be transferred to or withdrawn
from any of the other available investment funds.

H.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Plan invests in shares of funds managed by State Street.  State Street acts
as trustee for only those investments as defined by the Plan.  Transactions in
such investments qualify as party-in-interest transactions which are exempt
from the prohibited transaction rules.

I.  TAX STATUS

Bethlehem has received determinations from the Internal Revenue Service, the
most recent of which is dated August 11, 1995, that the Trust forming part of
the Plan is a qualified trust within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and is exempt from Federal income tax under Section
501(a) of such Code.  The Plan has been amended since receiving the most recent
determination letter.  However, the Plan Administrator believes the

                                   - 7 -




<PAGE> 8

Plan is designed and is currently operating in compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.

J.  FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

The Plan adopted Statement of Position ("SOP") 99-3, Accounting for and
Reporting of Certain Defined Contribution Benefit Plan Investments and Other
Disclosure Matters.  Certain reclassifications of the 1998 amounts have been
made to conform to the 1999 presentation in accordance with SOP 99-3.  This SOP
eliminated the previously required reporting of changes in net assets by
investment option for participant-directed investments.

K.  TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

Although it has not expressed an intention to do so, Bethlehem has the right
under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate
the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.  Upon termination of the Plan or
the complete discontinuance of Matching Company Contributions, the amounts
credited to participants' accounts will be fully vested and non-forfeitable.

L.  OTHER MATTERS

The Plan's Fixed Income Fund held a Mutual Benefits Life Insurance Company
(MBL) GAC which was scheduled to mature on September 30, 1992, at a contract
rate of 8.0%.  On July 16, 1991, New Jersey's Department of Insurance placed
MBL under rehabilitation and placed a moratorium on withdrawals from all GACs
issued by MBL.  The Plan continued to accrue interest on this contract;
however, effective January 1, 1992, such accruals were reduced from 8.0% to
3.0% as an estimate of the actual interest rate to be determined in the
rehabilitation process.  On November 10, 1993, the Superior Court of New Jersey
approved the Plan of Rehabilitation for MBL.  This Rehabilitation Plan provided
contract holders with the option to Opt-In (participate in the Rehabilitation
Plan) or Opt-Out (receive a series of payments).  Effective March 28, 1994,
State Street, acting as Investment Manager for the Fixed Income Fund, elected
to Opt-In to the Plan of Rehabilitation.  Under this election, the MBL GAC was
restructured and issued as a Wrapped Accumulation Contract (WAC) whose assets
are invested in a separate account of MBL Life Assurance Corporation (MBLLAC),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of MBL.  A consortium of insurance companies is
guaranteeing the July 16, 1991, contract value and accrued interest through
December 31, 1991, valued at approximately $7.2 million for the Plan.
Additionally, the Rehabilitation Plan provides for interest on the MBLLAC WAC
at rates of 14.4% for the period of November 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998,
15.0% for the period of January 1, 1999 through March 31, 1999, 20.0% for the
month of April 1999 and 25.0% for the month of May 1999.  Subsequent to 1994,
interest rates are reset periodically until final maturity, but cannot go below
0%.  On January 9, 1997 the Supreme Court of New Jersey approved a new
settlement agreement which provides for the restructured MBLLAC WAC to be paid
out on June 1, 1999.  On June 1, 1999 a full book value payment in the amount
of $11.1 million was paid to the Fixed Income Fund representing the final
distribution to contract holders.

                             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



To the Participants and Administrator of the
Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of
Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for
benefits of the Savings Plan for Salaried Employees of Bethlehem Steel
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the "Plan) at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedule of assets
held for investment purposes is presented for the purpose of additional
analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements but is
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure Under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  This supplemental schedule is the responsibility of the
Plan's management.  The supplemental schedule has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
